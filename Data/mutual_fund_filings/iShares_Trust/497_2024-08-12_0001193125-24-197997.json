Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell\nshares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c\nTrust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d )\nprovides that BFA will pay all\noperating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition\nand disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v)\ndistribution fees or expenses,\nand (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You\nmay pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries,\nwhich are not reflected in the\ntables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.47%     None       0.00%       0.47%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA\nunder the Investment Advisory\nAgreement exclude acquired fund\nfees and expenses, if any. 2 The\namount rounded to 0.00%. Example.\nThis Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of owning\nshares of the Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time\nperiods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses\nremain the same. Although your\nactual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 35%\nof the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe Morningstar Global Artificial\nIntelligence Select Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of\nequity securities issued by\ncompanies with exposure to\nartificial intelligence ( \u201c AI \u201d\n) technologies, including\ngenerative AI, AI data and\ninfrastructure, AI software, and\nAI services (each an \u201c AI\nsubtheme \u201d ), as determined by\nthe equity research team of\nMorningstar, Inc. (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c Morningstar \u201d ).\nThe Underlying Index is a subset\nof the Morningstar Global Markets\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ),\nwhich represents approximately\nthe top 97% of the global\ninvestable equity market\ncapitalization. The eligible\nuniverse of securities in the\nUnderlying Index includes the\nParent Index, excluding companies\nin India or the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and companies with\naverage three-month trailing\ndaily trading volume less than $2\nmillion and float market\ncapitalization of less than $300\nmillion. The Index Provider\nscores companies in the eligible\nuniverse on a four-point thematic\nexposure scale based on exposure\nto at least one AI subtheme and\nthen assigns each company to one\nof three tiers ( i.e ., Tier 1,\nTier 2 or Tier 3). Morningstar\nconsiders each company\u2019s role in\nthe AI subtheme value chain,\nexpected net profit increase from\nexposure to at least one AI\nsubtheme and the portion of\nrevenue expected to be derived\nfrom each AI subtheme over the\nnext five years. Companies with a\nscore of 2 or higher on the\ngenerative AI subtheme are\nassigned to Tier 1, and the rest\nare classified as either Tier 2\nor Tier 3. All companies with a\nscore of at least 2 across any\none of the three other AI\nsubthemes ( i.e ., Al data and\ninfrastructure, Al services, or\nAl software) are assigned to Tier\n2. Companies with an aggregate\nscore of at least 3 across all\nfour AI subthemes are also\nassigned to Tier 2. All remaining\ncompanies with a non-zero score\non at least one AI subtheme are\nassigned to Tier 3. The Index\nProvider then ranks the companies\nto emphasize thematic purity and\nexposure to the generative AI\nsubtheme according to the\nfollowing ranking criteria (in\ndescending order): \u2022 Tier 1\ncompanies are preferred over Tier\n2 companies, and Tier 2 companies\nare preferred over Tier 3\ncompanies. \u2022 Generative AI\nsubtheme score (highest to\nlowest). \u2022 Aggregate score across\nall 4 subthemes (highest to\nlowest). \u2022 Current index\nconstituents are given\npreference. \u2022 Current total\nmarket capitalization, with\npreference to smaller market\ncapitalization over larger market\ncapitalization. Morningstar\ngenerally includes the top 50\ncompanies in the Underlying\nIndex, subject to adjustments for\ncorporate actions. The Underlying\nIndex is weighted by float-\nadjusted market capitalization;\nhowever, the aggregate weight of\nTier 3 securities cannot exceed\n10%, and the excess weight is\nredistributed S-2 proportionally\nto Tier 1 and Tier 2 securities.\nAdditionally, the weight of any\none Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3\nsecurity, respectively, cannot\nexceed 6%, 3% and 3%, with the\nexcess weight distributed\nproportionally within each Tier.\nIf the aggregate weight of\nsecurities with a weight of at\nleast 4.5% exceeds 22.5%, then\nMorningstar caps the weight of\nany one security at 6% and the\nsum of securities at 22.5%, with\nexcess weight redistributed\nproportionally within each Tier.\nThe Underlying Index is\nrebalanced quarterly on the third\nFriday of March, June and\nSeptember (effective the\nfollowing business day) and\nreconstituted and rebalanced\nannually following the third\nFriday of December (effective the\nfollowing business day). To\nremain in the Underlying Index,\ncurrent constituents must have an\naverage three-month daily trading\nvolume of at least $1.6 million\nand a free-float market\ncapitalization of at least $240\nmillion at the annual\nreconstitution. As of July 10,\n2024, the Underlying Index\nconsisted of 48 issuers from the\nfollowing seven countries or\nregions: Canada, France, Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, the United\nKingdom and the U.S. The\nUnderlying Index includes large-,\nmid- and small-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over\ntime. As of July 10, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the\ntechnology and AI industries or\nsectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to\nchange over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try\nto \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary\ndefensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued.\nIndexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least\n80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in\ninvestments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures,\noptions and swap contracts, cash\nand cash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates,\nas well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index,\nbut which BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying\nIndex. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a\nderivative position will be\ntreated as part of that position\nfor the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying S-3\nIndex. The Fund seeks to track\nthe investment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and\nexpenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing\nup to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any\ncollateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is sponsored by\nMorningstar, which is independent\nof the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities are not\nconsidered to be issued by\nmembers of any industry. Summary\nof Principal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk\nis difficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Artificial\nIntelligence Technology Risk.\nArtificial Intelligence ( \u201c AI \u201d\n) technology is generally highly\nreliant on the collection and\nanalysis of large amounts of\ndata, and it is not possible or\npracticable to incorporate all\nrelevant data into the model that\nsuch AI utilizes to operate.\nCertain data in such models will\ninevitably contain a degree of\ninaccuracy and error \u2013\npotentially materially so \u2013 and\ncould otherwise be inadequate or\nflawed, which would be likely to\ndegrade the effectiveness of the\nAI technology. Companies involved\nin, or exposed to, artificial\nintelligence-related businesses\nmay have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or\npersonnel. These companies face\nintense competition and\npotentially rapid product\nobsolescence, and many depend\nsignificantly on retaining and\ngrowing the consumer base of\ntheir respective products and\nservices. Many of these companies\nare also reliant on the end-user\ndemand of products and services\nin various industries that may in\npart utilize artificial\nintelligence. Further, many\ncompanies involved in, or exposed\nto, artificial intelligence-\nrelated businesses may be\nsubstantially exposed to the\nmarket and business risks of\nother industries or sectors, and\nthe Fund may be adversely\naffected by negative developments\nimpacting those companies,\nindustries or sectors. Thematic\nInvesting Risk. The Fund relies\non the Index Provider for the\nidentification of securities for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index\nthat reflect themes and sub-\nthemes, and its performance may\nsuffer if such securities are not\ncorrectly identified or if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an\nunexpected manner. Performance\nmay also suffer if the stocks\nincluded in the Underlying Index\ndo not benefit from the\ndevelopment of such themes or\nsub-themes. Performance may also\nbe impacted by the inclusion of\nnon-theme-relevant exposures in\nthe Underlying S-4 Index. There\nis no guarantee that the\nUnderlying Index will reflect the\ntheme and sub-theme exposures\nintended. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject\nto changes in value, and their\nvalues may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The\nUnderlying Index is composed of\ncommon stocks, which generally\nsubject their holders to more\nrisks than preferred stocks and\ndebt securities because common\nstockholders\u2019 claims are\nsubordinated to those of holders\nof preferred stocks and debt\nsecurities upon the bankruptcy of\nthe issuer. Market Risk . The\nFund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market\nmovements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThere is no guarantee that the\nFund\u2019s investment results will\nhave a high degree of correlation\nto those of the Underlying Index\nor that the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack the Underlying Index.\nErrors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction\nof the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology\nmay occur from time to time and\nmay not be identified and\ncorrected by the Index Provider\nfor a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may\nimpact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider, and\ncould cause the Index Provider to\npostpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or\nexpected composition. Asset Class\nRisk. Securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund's portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to the general\nfinancial markets, a particular\nfinancial market or other asset\nclasses. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant (as\ndefined in the Creations and\nRedemptions section of this\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ))\nmay engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e., on behalf of\nother market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem, Fund shares may be more\nlikely to trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting.\nAuthorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be\nheightened for exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ), such as the\nFund, that invest in securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers or\nother securities or instruments\nthat have lower trading volumes.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may\nbe susceptible to an increased\nrisk of loss, including losses\ndue to adverse events that affect\nthe Fund\u2019s investments more than\nthe market as a whole, to the\nextent that the Fund's\ninvestments are S-5 concentrated\nin the securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or\nissuers, country, group of\ncountries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries,\nsector, market segment or asset\nclass. Currency Risk . Because\nthe Fund's NAV is determined in\nU.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV\ncould decline if the currency of\na non-U.S. market in which the\nFund invests depreciates against\nthe U.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof such currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund's NAV may change quickly\nand without warning.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, the Fund's\nadviser, distributor, the Index\nProvider and other service\nproviders, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or the\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests have the ability\nto cause disruptions, negatively\nimpact the Fund\u2019s business\noperations and/or potentially\nresult in financial losses to the\nFund and its shareholders. While\nthe Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to\naddress system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and\nsystems. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of the Fund\u2019s\nIndex Provider and other service\nproviders, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests. Geographic Risk\n. A natural disaster could occur\nin a geographic region in which\nthe Fund invests, which could\nadversely affect the economy or\nthe business operations of\ncompanies in the specific\ngeographic region, causing an\nadverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments in, or which are\nexposed to, the affected region.\nIndexing Investment Risk . The\nFund is not actively managed, and\nBFA generally does not attempt to\ntake defensive positions under\nany market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Infectious\nIllness Risk. A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, may result in travel\nrestrictions, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions,\nbusiness closures, lower consumer\ndemand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts. Markets may\nexperience temporary closures,\nextreme volatility, severe\nlosses, reduced liquidity and\nincreased trading costs. Such\nevents may adversely affect the\nFund and its investments and may\nimpact the Fund\u2019s ability to\npurchase or sell securities or\ncause elevated tracking error and\nincreased premiums or discounts\nto the Fund's NAV. Despite the\ndevelopment of vaccines, the\nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand its effects cannot be\npredicted with certainty. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities to which\nthe Fund has exposure. Changes in\nthe financial condition or credit\nrating of an issuer of those\nsecurities may cause the value of\nthe securities to decline. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be more mature and subject to\nmore limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller\ncapitalization companies. During\ndifferent market cycles, the\nperformance of large-\ncapitalization companies has\ntrailed the overall performance\nof the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk.\nCertain shareholders, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the S-6\nFund\u2019s adviser or an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may\nfrom time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund\nshares, or may invest in the Fund\nand hold their investment for a\nlimited period of time. There can\nbe no assurance that any large\nshareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem\ntheir investment. Redemptions of\na large number of Fund shares\ncould require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption\nrequests, which can accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold\na relatively large proportion of\nits assets in cash in\nanticipation of large\nredemptions, diluting its\ninvestment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nwhen it might not otherwise do\nso, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or\nhave a material effect on the\nmarket price of the Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . As the Fund\nwill not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that BFA's investment\nstrategy may not produce the\nintended results. Market Trading\nRisk . The Fund faces numerous\nmarket trading risks, including\nthe potential lack of an active\nmarket for Fund shares, losses\nfrom trading in secondary\nmarkets, periods of high\nvolatility and disruptions in the\ncreation/redemption process. ANY\nOF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,\nMAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES\nTRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT\nTO NAV . Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to\nlarge-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the\nsecurities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Certain\nchanges in the U.S. economy, such\nas when the U.S. economy weakens\nor when its financial markets\ndecline, may have an adverse\neffect on the securities to which\nthe Fund has exposure. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that\nthe Fund may lose money because\nthe borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk .\nTechnology companies, and\ncompanies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have\nlimited product S-7 lines,\nmarkets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel.\nThese companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially\nrapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may\nface unexpected risks and costs\nassociated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on\nintellectual property rights and\nmay be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those\nrights. Technology companies may\nface increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal\naction. Tracking Error Risk . The\nFund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur because\nof differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying\nIndex, pricing differences\n(including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s\nprice at the local market close\nand the Fund's valuation of a\nsecurity at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV),\ntransaction costs incurred by the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in\ntiming of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences\nbetween the methodologies used in\ncalculating the value of the\nUnderlying Index and determining\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Valuation Risk .\nThe price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund's valuation of the security\nor other asset and from the value\nused by the Underlying Index,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology as a result of\ntrade suspensions or for other\nreasons. In addition, the value\nof the securities or other assets\nin the Fund's portfolio may\nchange on days or during time\nperiods when shareholders will\nnot be able to purchase or sell\nthe Fund's shares. Authorized\nParticipants who purchase or\nredeem Fund shares on days when\nthe Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities may receive fewer or\nmore shares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they\nwould have received had the\nsecurities not been fair valued\nor been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value\ninvestments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by\npricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-8\nPerformance Information The bar\nchart and table that follow show\nhow the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide\nsome indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing\nhow the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1 year and since\ninception compare with the\nUnderlying Index.Both assume that\nall dividends and distributions\nhave been reinvested in the Fund.\nPast performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily\nindicate how the Fund will\nperform in the future.If BFA had\nnot waived certain Fund fees\nduring certain periods, the\nFund's returns would have been\nlower.

Fund\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient\ncapital gains of the same\ncharacter from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from\nthe sale of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes\non distributions and sales of\nFund shares may exceed Fund\nreturns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions. 2 Effective August\n12, 2024, the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex changed from the NYSE\nFactSet Global Robotics and\nArtificial Intelligence Index to\nthe Morningstar Global Artificial\nIntelligence Select Index.The\ninception date of the Morningstar\nGlobal Artificial Intelligence\nSelect Index is May 14, 2024.\n\nS-10\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui and Mr. Savage have been\nPortfolio Managers of the Fund\nsince 2018. Mr. Whitehead has\nbeen a Portfolio Manager of the\nFund since 2022. Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the\nFund may only be bought and sold\nin the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather\nthan at NAV, shares may trade at\na price greater than NAV (a\npremium) or less than NAV (a\ndiscount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the\ndifference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay\nto purchase shares of the Fund\n(bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when\nbuying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Tax Information The\nFund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an individual retirement\naccount ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in which\ncase, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when\nwithdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase\nshares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank),\nBFA or other related companies\nmay pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems\nor other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a\nconflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or\nother intermediary and your\nsalesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information. S-11 [THIS\nPAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\nMore Information About the Fund\nThis Prospectus contains\nimportant information about\ninvesting in the Fund. Please\nread this Prospectus carefully\nbefore you make any investment\ndecisions. Additional information\nregarding the Fund is available\nat www.iShares.com. On August 12,\n2024, the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index\nchanged from the NYSE FactSet\nGlobal Robotics and Artificial\nIntelligence Index to the\nMorningstar Global Artificial\nIntelligence Select Index. On\nAugust 12, 2024, the name of the\nFund changed from the iShares\nRobotics and Artificial\nIntelligence Multisector ETF to\nthe iShares Future AI & Tech ETF.\nBFA is the investment adviser to\nthe Fund. Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on NYSE Arca,\nInc. ( \u201c NYSE Arca \u201d ). The\nmarket price for a share of the\nFund may be different from the\nFund\u2019s most recent NAV. ETFs are\nfunds that trade like other\npublicly traded securities. The\nFund is designed to track an\nindex. Similar to shares of an\nindex mutual fund, each share of\nthe Fund represents an ownership\ninterest in an underlying\nportfolio of securities and other\ninstruments intended to track a\nmarket index. Unlike shares of a\nmutual fund, which can be bought\nand redeemed from the issuing\nfund by all shareholders at a\nprice based on NAV, shares of the\nFund may be purchased or redeemed\ndirectly from the Fund at NAV\nsolely by Authorized Participants\nand only in aggregations of a\nspecified number of shares ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Also unlike\nshares of a mutual fund, shares\nof the Fund are listed on a\nnational securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at\nmarket prices that change\nthroughout the day. The Fund\ninvests in a particular segment\nof the securities markets and\nseeks to track the performance of\na securities index that is not\nrepresentative of the market as a\nwhole. The Fund is designed to be\nused as part of broader asset\nallocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in the\nFund should not constitute a\ncomplete investment program. An\nindex is a financial calculation,\nbased on a grouping of financial\ninstruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while the\nFund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and the Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons,\nincluding transaction costs,\nnon-U.S. currency valuations,\nasset valuations, corporate\nactions (such as mergers and\nspin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex resulting from the Fund's\nuse of representative sampling or\nfrom legal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nthe Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the Index Provider may\nmake changes to the methodology\nor other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of\nthe Underlying Index performance\non a going-forward basis after\nthe effective date of such change\nor adjustment. Therefore, the\nUnderlying Index performance\nshown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\nor adjustment will generally not\nbe recalculated or restated to\nreflect such change or\nadjustment. 1 Because the Fund\nuses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy, it can be\nexpected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. \u201c\nReplication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. The Fund may borrow as a\ntemporary measure for\nextraordinary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the\nsettlement of securities or other\ntransactions. The Fund does not\nintend to borrow money in order\nto leverage its portfolio. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not a\nbank deposit and it is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other\ngovernment agency, BFA or any of\nits affiliates. The Fund's\ninvestment objective and the\nUnderlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A\nFurther Discussion of Principal\nRisks The Fund is subject to\nvarious risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. You\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund could underperform other\ninvestments. The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com.\nArtificial Intelligence\nTechnology Risk. Artificial\nIntelligence ( \u201c AI \u201d )\ntechnology is generally highly\nreliant on the collection and\nanalysis of large amounts of\ndata, and it is not possible or\npracticable to incorporate all\nrelevant data into the model that\nsuch AI utilizes to operate.\nCertain data in such models will\ninevitably contain a degree of\ninaccuracy and error \u2013\npotentially materially so \u2013 and\ncould otherwise be inadequate or\nflawed, which would be likely to\ndegrade the effectiveness of the\nAI technology. Companies involved\nin, or exposed to, AI-related\nbusinesses may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial\nresources or personnel. These\ncompanies face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid\nproduct obsolescence, and many\ndepend significantly on retaining\nand growing the consumer base of\ntheir respective products and\nservices. Many of these companies\nare also reliant on the end-user\ndemand of products and services\nin various industries that may in\npart utilize artificial\nintelligence. Further, many\ncompanies involved in, or exposed\nto, AI-related businesses may be\nsubstantially exposed to the\nmarket and business risks of\nother industries or sectors, and\nthe Fund may be adversely\naffected by negative developments\nimpacting those companies,\nindustries or sectors. In\naddition, these companies are\nheavily dependent on intellectual\nproperty rights and may be\nadversely affected by loss or\nimpairment of those rights. There\ncan be no assurance that\ncompanies involved in AI will be\nable to successfully protect\ntheir intellectual property to\nprevent the misappropriation of\ntheir technology, or that\ncompetitors will not develop\ntechnology that is substantially\nsimilar or superior to such\ncompanies\u2019 technology. Legal and\nregulatory changes, particularly\nrelated to 2 information privacy\nand data protection, may have an\nimpact on a company\u2019s products or\nservices. Companies engaged in\nartificial intelligence-related\nactivities could face increasing\nregulatory scrutiny in the\nfuture, which may limit the\ndevelopment of this technology\nand impede the growth of\ncompanies that develop and/or\nutilize this technology. AI\ncompanies typically engage in\nsignificant amounts of spending\non research and development, and\nthere is no guarantee that the\nproducts or services produced by\nthese companies will be\nsuccessful. AI companies,\nespecially smaller companies,\ntend to be more volatile than\ncompanies that do not rely\nheavily on technology. AI\ncompanies are potential targets\nfor cyberattacks, which can have\na materially adverse impact on\nthe performance of these\ncompanies. In addition, the\ncollection of data from consumers\nand other sources could face\nincreased scrutiny as regulators\nconsider how the data is\ncollected, stored, safeguarded\nand used. AI and data services\ncompanies may face regulatory\nfines and penalties, including\npotential forced break-ups, that\ncould hinder the ability of the\ncompanies to operate on an\nongoing basis. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to other securities\nor indexes that track other\ncountries, groups of countries,\nregions, industries, groups of\nindustries, markets, market\nsegments, asset classes or\nsectors. Various types of\nsecurities, currencies and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nthe general financial markets\ndepending upon a number of\nfactors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause the Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e. , on behalf\nof other market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem Creation Units, Fund\nshares may be more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to\nNAV and possibly face trading\nhalts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened because ETFs,\nsuch as the Fund, that invest in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers or other securities or\ninstruments that are less widely\ntraded often involve greater\nsettlement and operational issues\nand capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\navailability of Authorized\nParticipants. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund's\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or\nissuers, country, group of\ncountries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries,\nproject types, group of project\ntypes, sector, market segment or\nasset class. The Fund may be more\nadversely 3 affected by the\nunderperformance of those\nsecurities and/or other assets,\nmay experience increased price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\noccurrences affecting those\nsecurities and/or other assets\nthan a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund's\nNAV is determined on the basis of\nthe U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the\nU.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof such currency, even if such\ncurrency value of the Fund's\nholdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange\nrates can be very volatile and\ncan change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. Cybersecurity\nRisk. The Fund, Authorized\nParticipants, service providers\nand the relevant listing exchange\nare susceptible to operational,\ninformation security and related\n\u201c cyber \u201d risks both directly and\nthrough their service providers.\nSimilar types of cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value. In\ngeneral, cyber incidents can\nresult from deliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. Cyber\nincidents include, but are not\nlimited to, gaining unauthorized\naccess to digital systems ( e.g.\n, through \u201c hacking \u201d or\nmalicious software coding) for\npurposes of misappropriating\nassets or sensitive information,\ncorrupting data, or causing\noperational disruption.\nCyberattacks may also be carried\nout in a manner that does not\nrequire gaining unauthorized\naccess, such as causing denial-\nof-service attacks on websites (\ni.e. , efforts to make network\nservices unavailable to intended\nusers). Geopolitical tensions may\nincrease the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity failures by, or\nbreaches of, the systems of the\nFund's adviser, distributor and\nother service providers\n(including, but not limited to,\nindex and benchmark providers,\nfund accountants, custodians,\ntransfer agents and\nadministrators), market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or the\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests have the ability\nto cause disruptions and impact\nbusiness operations, potentially\nresulting in: financial losses,\ninterference with the Fund\u2019s\nability to calculate its NAV,\ndisclosure of confidential\ntrading information, impediments\nto trading, submission of\nerroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders,\nthe inability of the Fund or its\nservice providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of\napplicable privacy and other\nlaws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, or additional\ncompliance costs. In addition,\ncyberattacks may render records\nof Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund\nshares, and other data integral\nto the functioning of the Fund\ninaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. Substantial costs may\nbe incurred by the Fund in order\nto resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\nsuch cyber incidents, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyberattacks will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot 4 control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by service providers\nto the Fund, issuers in which the\nFund invests, the Index Provider,\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. The Fund and its\nshareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Equity\nSecurities Risk. The Fund invests\nin equity securities, which are\nsubject to changes in value that\nmay be attributable to market\nperception of a particular issuer\nor to general stock market\nfluctuations that affect all\nissuers. Investments in equity\nsecurities may be more volatile\nthan investments in other asset\nclasses. The Underlying Index is\ncomposed of common stocks, which\ngenerally subject their holders\nto more risks than preferred\nstocks and debt securities\nbecause common stockholders'\nclaims are subordinated to those\nof holders of preferred stocks\nand debt securities upon the\nbankruptcy of the issuer.\nGeographic Risk. Some of the\ncompanies in which the Fund\ninvests are located in parts of\nthe world that have historically\nbeen prone to natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes, tornadoes,\nvolcanic eruptions, droughts,\nfloods, hurricanes or tsunamis,\nand are economically sensitive to\nenvironmental events. Any such\nevent may adversely impact the\neconomies of these geographic\nareas or business operations of\ncompanies in these geographic\nareas, causing an adverse impact\non the value of the Fund.\nIndexing Investment Risk. The\nFund is not actively managed and\nmay be affected by a general\ndecline in market segments\nrelated to the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund invests in securities\nincluded in, or representative\nof, the Underlying Index,\nregardless of their investment\nmerits. BFA generally does not\nattempt to invest the Fund's\nassets in defensive positions\nunder any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets.\nIndex-Related Risk. The Fund\nseeks to achieve a return that\ncorresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of the\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor any agents that may act on its\nbehalf will compile the\nUnderlying Index accurately, or\nthat the Underlying Index will be\ndetermined, composed or\ncalculated accurately. While the\nIndex Provider provides\ndescriptions of what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability in relation to the\nquality, accuracy or completeness\nof the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not\nguarantee that the Underlying\nIndex will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology.\nBFA\u2019s mandate as described in\nthis Prospectus is to manage the\nFund consistently with the\nUnderlying Index provided by the\nIndex Provider to BFA. BFA does\nnot provide any warranty or\nguarantee against the Index\nProvider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nErrors in respect of the quality,\naccuracy and completeness of the\ndata used to compile the\nUnderlying Index may occur from\ntime to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of\ntime or at all, particularly\nwhere the indices are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks by\nfunds or managers. Such errors\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, during\na period where the Underlying\nIndex contains incorrect\nconstituents, the Fund would have\nmarket exposure to such\nconstituents and would be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from Index\nProvider errors will be kept by\nthe Fund 5 and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs resulting\nfrom Index Provider errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider, and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to the\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. The postponement of\na scheduled rebalance could mean\nthat constituents of the\nUnderlying Index that would\notherwise be removed at rebalance\ndue to changes in market\ncapitalizations, issuer credit\nratings, or other reasons may\nremain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the\nUnderlying Index to vary from\nthose expected under normal\nconditions. Apart from scheduled\nrebalances, the Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out\nadditional ad hoc rebalances to\nthe Underlying Index due to\nreaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions or corporate events\nor, for example, to correct an\nerror in the selection of index\nconstituents. When the Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced and the Fund\nin turn rebalances its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such\nportfolio rebalancing will be\nborne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. Therefore,\nerrors and additional ad hoc\nrebalances carried out by the\nIndex Provider or its agents to\nthe Underlying Index may increase\nthe costs to and the tracking\nerror risk of the Fund.\nInfectious Illness Risk. A\nwidespread outbreak of an\ninfectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely\naffect the economies of many\nnations and the global economy\nand may impact individual issuers\nand capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen. An infectious\nillness outbreak may result in\ntravel restrictions, closed\ninternational borders, disruption\nof healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions, lower\nconsumer demand, temporary and\npermanent closures of businesses,\nlayoffs, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts, as well as\ngeneral concern and uncertainty.\nAn infectious illness outbreak\nmay result in extreme volatility,\nsevere losses, credit\ndeterioration of issuers, and\ndisruptions in markets, which\ncould adversely impact the Fund\nand its investments, including\nimpairing any hedging activity.\nCertain local markets may be\nsubject to closures. Any\nsuspension of trading in markets\nin which the Fund invests will\nhave an impact on the Fund and\nits investments and will impact\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities in such markets.\nMarket or economic disruptions\ncould result in elevated tracking\nerror and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nAdditionally, an outbreak could\nimpair the operations of the\nFund\u2019s service providers,\nincluding BFA, which could\nadversely impact the Fund.\nGovernmental and quasi-\ngovernmental authorities and\nregulators throughout the world\nmay respond to an outbreak and\nany resulting economic\ndisruptions with a variety of\nfiscal and monetary policy\nchanges, including direct capital\ninfusions into companies and\nother issuers, new monetary\npolicy tools, and changes in\ninterest rates. A reversal 6 of\nthese policies, or the\nineffectiveness of such policies,\nis likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments. An\noutbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social\nand economic risks in certain\ncountries or globally, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\nand its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nDespite the development of\nvaccines, the duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its effects\ncannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of the Fund depends\non the performance of individual\nsecurities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Any issuer of these\nsecurities may perform poorly,\ncausing the value of its\nsecurities to decline. Poor\nperformance may be caused by poor\nmanagement decisions, competitive\npressures, changes in technology,\nexpiration of patent protection,\ndisruptions in supply, labor\nproblems or shortages, corporate\nrestructurings, fraudulent\ndisclosures, credit deterioration\nof the issuer or other factors.\nIssuers may, in times of distress\nor at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate\ndividends, which may also cause\ntheir stock prices to decline. An\nissuer may also be subject to\nrisks associated with the\ncountries, states and regions in\nwhich the issuer resides,\ninvests, sells products, or\notherwise conducts operations.\nLarge-Capitalization Companies\nRisk. Large-capitalization\ncompanies may be less able than\nsmaller capitalization companies\nto adapt to changing market\nconditions. Large-capitalization\ncompanies may be more mature and\nsubject to more limited growth\npotential compared with smaller\ncapitalization companies. During\ndifferent market cycles, the\nperformance of large-\ncapitalization companies has\ntrailed the overall performance\nof the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk.\nCertain shareholders, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser or an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may invest in the Fund and\nhold their investment for a\nlimited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or\nloan Fund shares (to secure\nfinancing or otherwise), which\nmay result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party.\nThere can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares by\nthese shareholders may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s liquidity and\nnet assets. To the extent the\nFund permits redemptions in cash,\nthese redemptions may force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nwhen it might not otherwise do\nso, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of the\nShares and increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs and/or accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or gains and cause the Fund\nto make taxable distributions to\nits shareholders earlier than the\nFund otherwise would have. In\naddition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as\nreceiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during\nor with respect to such tax year.\nThe Fund also may be required to\nsell its more liquid Fund\ninvestments to meet a large\nredemption, in which case the\nFund\u2019s remaining assets may be\nless liquid, more volatile, and\nmore difficult to price. To the\nextent these large shareholders\ntransact in shares on the\nsecondary market, such\ntransactions may account for a\nlarge 7 percentage of the trading\nvolume for the shares of the Fund\nand may, therefore, have a\nmaterial upward or downward\neffect on the market price of the\nFund shares. In addition, large\npurchases of Fund shares may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nManagement Risk. Because BFA uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, the Fund will\nnot fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities not included in the\nUnderlying Index. As a result,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk\nthat BFA\u2019s investment strategy,\nthe implementation of which is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. Market Risk.\nThe Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. The value of a\nfinancial instrument or other\nasset may decline due to changes\nin general market conditions,\neconomic trends or events that\nare not specifically related to\nthe particular instrument or\nasset, or factors that affect one\nor more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries, regions,\nmarkets, industries, sectors or\nasset classes, as applicable.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non the Fund and its investments\nand could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. Absence of\nActive Market. Although shares of\nthe Fund are listed for trading\non one or more stock exchanges,\nthere can be no assurance that an\nactive trading market for such\nshares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or\nAuthorized Participants. Risk of\nSecondary Listings. The Fund's\nshares may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges\nother than the U.S. stock\nexchange where the Fund's primary\nlisting is maintained, and may\notherwise be made available to\nnon-U.S. investors through funds\nor structured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that\nthe Fund\u2019s shares will continue\nto trade on any such stock\nexchange or in any market or that\nthe Fund\u2019s shares will continue\nto meet the requirements for\nlisting or trading on any\nexchange or in any market. The\nFund's shares may be less\nactively traded in certain\nmarkets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the\nexecution and settlement risks\nand market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\navailable to investors who trade\nFund shares on a U.S. stock\nexchange during regular U.S.\nmarket hours may not be available\nto investors who trade in other\nmarkets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such\nmarkets being less efficient.\nSecondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of the Fund may trade in\nthe secondary market at times\nwhen the Fund does not accept\norders to purchase or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\n8 discounts than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts purchase and\nredemption orders. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may\nbe halted by a stock exchange\nbecause of market conditions or\nfor other reasons. In addition,\ntrading in Fund shares on a stock\nexchange or in any market may be\nsubject to trading halts caused\nby extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to \u201c circuit\nbreaker \u201d rules on the stock\nexchange or market. Shares of the\nFund, similar to shares of other\nissuers listed on a stock\nexchange, may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk\nof increased volatility and price\ndecreases associated with being\nsold short. In addition, trading\nactivity in derivative products\nbased on the Fund may lead to\nincreased trading volume and\nvolatility in the secondary\nmarket for the shares of the\nFund. Shares of the Fund May\nTrade at Prices Other Than NAV.\nShares of the Fund trade on stock\nexchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV.\nThe NAV of the Fund is calculated\nat the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in\nthe market value of the Fund\u2019s\nholdings. The trading price of\nthe Fund's shares fluctuates\ncontinuously throughout trading\nhours based on both market supply\nof and demand for Fund shares and\nthe underlying value of the\nFund's portfolio holdings or NAV.\nAs a result, the trading prices\nof the Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during\nperiods of market volatility. ANY\nOF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,\nMAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES\nTRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT\nTO NAV . However, because shares\ncan be created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to the NAV of the Fund\nare not likely to be sustained\nover the long term (unlike shares\nof many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that the Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund's NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of the Fund\nthat differ significantly from\nits NAV. Authorized Participants\nmay be less willing to create or\nredeem Fund shares if there is a\nlack of an active market for such\nshares or its underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute\nto the Fund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to NAV. Costs\nof Buying or Selling Fund Shares.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you will\nlikely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In\naddition, you may incur the cost\nof the \u201c spread \u201d ; that is, the\ndifference between what investors\nare willing to pay for Fund\nshares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and\nthe price at which they are\nwilling to sell Fund shares (the\n\u201c ask \u201d price). The spread, which\nvaries over time for shares of\nthe Fund based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, is\ngenerally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if the\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. 9 In addition,\nincreased market volatility may\ncause wider spreads. There may\nalso be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults and an investment in Fund\nshares may not be advisable for\ninvestors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Stock prices of\nmid-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies\nand, therefore, the Fund\u2019s share\nprice may be more volatile than\nthose of funds that invest a\nlarger percentage of their assets\nin stocks issued by large-\ncapitalization companies. Stock\nprices of mid-capitalization\ncompanies are also more\nvulnerable than those of large-\ncapitalization companies to\nadverse business or economic\ndevelopments, and the stocks of\nmid-capitalization companies may\nbe less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies,\nmaking it difficult for the Fund\nto buy and sell shares of mid-\ncapitalization companies. In\naddition, mid-capitalization\ncompanies generally have less\ndiverse product lines than large-\ncapitalization companies and are\nmore susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments related to their\nproducts. Operational Risk. The\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund's\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. A decrease\nin imports or exports, changes in\ntrade regulations, inflation\nand/or an economic recession in\nthe U.S. may have a material\nadverse effect on the U.S.\neconomy and the securities listed\non U.S. exchanges. Proposed and\nadopted policy and legislative\nchanges in the U.S. are changing\nmany aspects of financial,\ncommercial, public health,\nenvironmental, and other\nregulation and may have a\nsignificant effect on U.S.\nmarkets generally, as well as on\nthe value of certain securities.\nGovernmental agencies project\nthat the U.S. will continue to\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, elevated public debt\nservice costs may constrain\nfuture economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that\ncould prevent the timely payment\nof interest or principal on U.S.\ngovernment debt, such as reaching\nthe legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. If U.S.\nrelations with certain countries\ndeteriorate, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as\nnon-U.S. issuers that rely on the\nU.S. for trade. The U.S. has also\nexperienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If these\ntrends were to continue, it may\nhave an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and the issuers in\nwhich the Fund invests.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the 10\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nBlackRock Institutional Trust\nCompany, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ), the\nFund's securities lending agent,\nwill take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of\nsubstitute payments for dividends\nwhen managing the Fund's\nsecurities lending program.\nTechnology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies, and\ncompanies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources and\npersonnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product\nintroduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nmay be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and\ndistribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners.\nThey are heavily dependent on\npatent and other intellectual\nproperty rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their\nprofitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or\nlegal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, actual or\nperceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects\nin their products and services,\nwhich may result in lawsuits,\ngovernment enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs.\nThematic Investing Risk. The Fund\nrelies on the Index Provider for\nthe identification of securities\nfor inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex that reflect themes and\nsub-themes, and its performance\nmay suffer if such securities are\nnot correctly identified or if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an\nunexpected manner. Performance\nmay also suffer if the stocks\nincluded in the Underlying Index\ndo not benefit from the\ndevelopment of such themes or\nsub-themes. Performance may also\nbe impacted by the inclusion of\nnon-theme-relevant exposures in\nthe Underlying Index. There is no\nguarantee that the Underlying\nIndex will reflect the theme and\nsub-theme exposures intended.\nTracking Error Risk. The Fund may\nbe subject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d\nwhich is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of\nthe Underlying Index. Tracking\nerror may occur because of\ndifferences between the\nsecurities and other instruments\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying\nIndex, pricing differences\n(including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s\nprice at the local market close\nand the Fund's valuation of a\nsecurity at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV),\ntransaction costs incurred by the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in\ntiming of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences 11\nbetween the methodologies used in\ncalculating the value of the\nUnderlying Index and determining\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Valuation Risk.\nThe price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund's valuation of the security\nor other asset and from the value\nused by the Underlying Index,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology as a result of\ntrade suspensions or for other\nreasons. Because non-U.S.\nexchanges may be open on days or\nduring time periods when the Fund\ndoes not price its shares, the\nvalue of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund's portfolio\nmay change on days or during time\nperiods when shareholders will\nnot be able to purchase or sell\nthe Fund\u2019s shares. In addition,\nfor purposes of calculating the\nFund's NAV, the value of assets\ndenominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies is translated into\nU.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates. This translation\nmay result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund's NAV and the\nprices used by the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could\nresult in a difference between\nthe Fund's performance and the\nperformance of the Underlying\nIndex. Authorized Participants\nwho purchase or redeem Fund\nshares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities\nmay receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. A Further\nDiscussion of Other Risks The\nFund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated\nwith its investments and\ninvestment strategies. The order\nof the below risk factors does\nnot indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor.\nBorrowing Risk. Borrowing may\nexaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. Borrowing\nwill cost the Fund interest\nexpense and other fees. The costs\nof borrowing may reduce the\nFund\u2019s return. Borrowing may also\ncause the Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy\nits obligations. Close-Out Risk\nfor Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are\npart of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent the Fund from closing out\na qualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit the Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to the Fund.\nCommunication Services Sector\nRisk. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies\nin the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the\nmedia and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the\ntelecommunication 12 services\nindustry group include providers\nof fiber-optic, fixed-line,\ncellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks.\nCompanies in the media and\nentertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking\nplatforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and\nInternet search engines.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected\nby industry competition,\nsubstantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications\nproducts and services due to\ntechnological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while\nall companies may be susceptible\nto network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of\nproprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. The communication\nservices sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with\ngovernmental regulations, delays\nor failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively\naffect the business of\ncommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the\nworld, specifically in the area\nof pre-marketing clearance of\nproducts and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry\ncan also be significantly\naffected by intense competition\nfor market share, including\ncompetition with alternative\ntechnologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product\ncompatibility and\nstandardization, consumer\npreferences, rapid product\nobsolescence, research and\ndevelopment of new products, lack\nof standardization or\ncompatibility with existing\ntechnologies, and a dependency on\npatent and copyright protections.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the\nneed to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in\ndeveloping new products and\nservices using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may\nmake the products and services of\ncertain communications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders with exposure to the\nU.S. are generally required to\nobtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\nTelecommunication providers\ninvesting in non-U.S. countries\nmay be subject to similar risks.\nAdditional risks include those\nrelated to competitive challenges\nin the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic\njoint ventures with U.S.\ncompanies and in non-U.S. markets\nfrom both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries can be significantly\naffected by several factors,\nincluding competition,\nparticularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new\ntechnologies, cyclicality of\nrevenues and earnings, a\npotential 13 decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted\nindividuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the\npotential increase in government\nregulation. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries may become obsolete\nquickly. Advertising spending can\nbe an important revenue source\nfor media and entertainment\ncompanies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending\ntypically decreases and, as a\nresult, media and entertainment\ncompanies tend to generate less\nrevenue. European Economic Risk.\nThe Economic and Monetary Union\n(the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201c EU \u201d )\nrequires compliance by member\nstates that are members of the\neurozone with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels,\nas well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every\ncountry in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone.\nAdditionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are\nindependent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the\nU.K.'s economy may be affected by\nglobal economic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common\ncurrency of eurozone countries),\nthe default or threat of default\nby an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state\nmay have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other\nEU member states and their\ntrading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have\nhistorically experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt\nlevels in several European\ncountries, including, but not\nlimited to, Austria, Belgium,\nCyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Portugal, Spain and\nUkraine. These events have\naffected and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may\nsignificantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial\nproblems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the\ndesired results, may result in\nsocial unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or\nmay have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations\naround the world. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The U.K. left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020.\nBrexit could adversely affect\nEuropean or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute\nto instability in global\npolitical institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial\nmarkets. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to\ninfluence by disruptive political\ngroups and ideologies, including,\nfor example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of\nEuropean countries may be subject\nto change and such countries may\nexperience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nThe occurrence of terrorist\nincidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also\nimpact financial markets. The\nimpact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant\nand far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value and\nliquidity of the Fund's\ninvestments. 14 Russian Invasion\nof Ukraine . Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine\non February 24, 2022. The extent\nand duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the\nvalue of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would\nhave invested more than 15% of\nits net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\nthe Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less\nwithout significantly changing\nthe market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nIf the Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced\nprices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption\nrequests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This\nmay be magnified in a rising\ninterest rate environment or\nother circumstances where\nredemptions from the Fund may be\ngreater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to\nliquidate holdings at the same\ntime as the Fund, causing\nincreased supply of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments in the\nmarket and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the 15 Fund\u2019s shares\nmay be impacted by the liquidity\nin the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that\nthe underlying securities or\nother instruments held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges\nor in foreign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s\nshares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between\nthe current price of an\nunderlying security and the last\nquoted price for the underlying\nsecurity ( i.e. , the Fund\u2019s\nquote from the closed foreign\nmarket). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a\nlarge portion of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying securities or other\ninstruments trade on that closed\nforeign market or when the\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nETFs. Non-U.S. Securities Risk.\nInvestments in the securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks of investing in the\nmarkets where such issuers are\nlocated, including heightened\nrisks of inflation,\nnationalization and market\nfluctuations caused by economic\nand political developments. As a\nresult of investing in non-U.S.\nsecurities, the Fund may be\nsubject to increased risk of loss\ncaused by any of the factors\nlisted below: \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers'\noperations or structure; \u25a0 A lack\nof market liquidity and market\nefficiency; \u25a0 Greater securities\nprice volatility; \u25a0 Exchange rate\nfluctuations and exchange\ncontrols; \u25a0 Less availability of\npublic information about issuers;\n\u25a0 Limitations on foreign\nownership of securities; \u25a0\nImposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Imposition of\nrestrictions on the expatriation\nof the funds or other assets of\nthe Fund; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs and delays in\nsettlement procedures; \u25a0\nDifficulties in enforcing\ncontractual obligations; \u25a0 Lower\nlevels of regulation of the\nsecurities markets; \u25a0 Weaker\naccounting, disclosure and\nreporting requirements and the\nrisk of being delisted from U.S.\nexchanges; and \u25a0 Legal principles\nrelating to corporate governance,\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties and\nliabilities and stockholders\u2019\nrights in markets in which the\nFund invests may differ from or\nmay not be as extensive or\nprotective as those that apply in\nthe U.S. Withholding Tax Reclaims\nRisk . The Fund may file claims\nto recover withholding tax on\ndividend and interest income (if\nany) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such\nwithholding tax reclaim is\npossible. Whether or when the\nFund will receive a withholding\ntax refund in the future is\nwithin the control of the tax\nauthorities in such countries.\nWhere the Fund expects to recover\nwithholding tax based on a\ncontinuous assessment of\nprobability of recovery, the NAV\nof the Fund generally includes\naccruals 16 for such tax refunds.\nThe Fund continues to evaluate\ntax developments for potential\nimpact to the probability of\nrecovery. If the likelihood of\nreceiving refunds materially\ndecreases, for example due to a\nchange in tax regulation or\napproach, accruals in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV for such refunds may need to\nbe written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect\nthat Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors in the\nFund at the time an accrual is\nwritten down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV\nregardless of whether they were\ninvestors during the accrual\nperiod. Conversely, if a Fund\nreceives a tax refund that has\nnot been previously accrued,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time\nthe claim is successful will\nbenefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors who sold their shares\nprior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase.\nRisk of Investing in Developed\nCountries. Investment in\ndeveloped country issuers may\nsubject the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, economic and other\nrisks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries\ngenerally tend to rely on\nservices sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth.\nA prolonged slowdown in one or\nmore services sectors is likely\nto have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed\ncountries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund invests have experienced\nstrained international relations\ndue to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security\nconcerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to\nwhich the Fund has exposure.\nHeavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and\nproduct markets, may have an\nadverse effect on certain\nissuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth\nor cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed\ncountries are heavily indebted\nand face rising healthcare and\nretirement expenses. In addition,\nprice fluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations\nimpacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk.\nIf certain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor the Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including the Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, or exercise rights\nor undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted\nby regulation or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of the\nFund to make investments in\ncertain securities may be\naffected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such\nlimitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings compared to\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex. This may increase the risk\nof the Fund being underinvested\nto the Underlying Index and\nincrease the risk of tracking\nerror. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund\ninvests in securities issued by\ncompanies that operate in certain\nregulated industries or in\ncertain emerging or international\nmarkets, is subject to corporate\nor regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in\ncertain futures or other\nderivative transactions, there\nmay be limits on the aggregate\nand/or fund-level amount invested\nor voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their 17\nproprietary accounts and for\nclient accounts (including the\nFund) that may not be exceeded\nwithout the grant of a license or\nother regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may\ncause BFA and its affiliates, the\nFund or other client accounts to\nsuffer disadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the\nTrust's policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nis available in the Fund's\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fund\nfact sheets providing information\nregarding the Fund's top holdings\nare posted on www.iShares.com\nwhen available and may be\nrequested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement Investment Adviser. As\ninvestment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the\ngeneral management and\nadministration of the Fund. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nIn managing the Fund, BFA may\ndraw upon the research and\nexpertise of its asset management\naffiliates with respect to\ncertain portfolio securities. In\nseeking to achieve the Fund's\ninvestment objective, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers,\ninvestment strategists and other\ninvestment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many\ndisciplines and leverages BFA\u2019s\nextensive resources. Pursuant to\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFund), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. For the fiscal year ended\nJuly 31, 2023, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund's\naverage daily net assets, at the\nannual rate of 0.47%. BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses in order to limit total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, BFA and its\naffiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of\napproximately $9.1 trillion. BFA\nand its affiliates trade and\ninvest for their own accounts in\nthe actual securities and types\nof securities in which the Fund\nmay also invest, which may affect\nthe price of such securities. 18\nA discussion regarding the basis\nfor the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available\nin the Fund's Annual Report for\nthe period ended July 31.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management\nteams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. Jennifer Hsui\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio\nmanager since 2007. Prior to\nthat, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio\nmanager from 2006 to 2007 for\nBarclays Global Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund\nsince 2018. Greg Savage has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a senior portfolio manager\nsince 2006. Prior to that, Mr.\nSavage was a portfolio manager\nfrom 2001 to 2006 for BGFA. Mr.\nSavage has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2018.\nPaul Whitehead has been with\nBlackRock since 1996, including\nhis years with Barclays Global\nInvestors ( \u201c BGI \u201d ), which\nmerged with BlackRock in 2009.\nMr. Whitehead has been employed\nby BlackRock as a Managing\nDirector since 2010 and a\nDirector from 2009 to 2010. Mr.\nWhitehead was employed by BGI as\nPrincipal from 2002 to 2009. Mr.\nWhitehead has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2022.\nThe Fund's SAI provides\nadditional information about the\nPortfolio Managers' compensation,\nother accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the\nPortfolio Managers' ownership (if\nany) of shares in the Fund.\nAdministrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ) is the administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for\nthe Fund. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. serves as custodian for the\nFund in connection with certain\nsecurities lending activities.\nConflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and\nits affiliates (including\nBlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees,\nin the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts\nand other accounts they manage,\nmay present conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. BFA and its\nAffiliates provide investment\nmanagement services to other\nfunds and discretionary managed\naccounts that may follow\ninvestment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and may\nengage in the ordinary course of\nbusiness in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof their clients may conflict\nwith those of the Fund. BFA or\none or more Affiliates act, or\nmay act, as an investor, research\nprovider, investment manager,\ncommodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor,\nfinancier, underwriter, adviser,\ntrader, lender, index provider,\nagent and/or principal, and have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other 19\ninstruments in which the Fund may\ndirectly or indirectly invest.\nThe Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in other\ntransactions with, companies with\nwhich an Affiliate has\nsignificant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests.\nThe Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured\nnotes) by entities for which an\nAffiliate provides and is\ncompensated for cash management\nservices relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances.\nThe Fund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, companies for\nwhich an Affiliate provides or\nmay in the future provide\nresearch coverage. An Affiliate\nmay have business relationships\nwith, and purchase or distribute\nor sell services or products from\nor to, distributors, consultants\nor others who recommend the Fund\nor who engage in transactions\nwith or for the Fund, and may\nreceive compensation for such\nservices. BFA or one or more\nAffiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise\naccounts and funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to\nthose of the Fund and/or that\nengage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies and other\ninstruments as the Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies (which may include\ninvestment companies that are\naffiliated with the Fund and BFA,\nto the extent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d )).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nthese Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by\nthe Fund and may result in BFA or\nan Affiliate having positions in\ncertain securities that are\nsenior or junior to, or have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that\nare owned by the Fund. Neither\nBlackRock nor any Affiliate is\nunder any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with the Fund. As a\nresult, an Affiliate may compete\nwith the Fund for appropriate\ninvestment opportunities. The\nresults of the Fund's investment\nactivities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of\nother accounts managed by\nBlackRock or an Affiliate, and it\nis possible that the Fund could\nsustain losses during periods in\nwhich one or more Affiliates and\nother accounts achieve profits on\ntheir trading for proprietary or\nother accounts. The opposite\nresult is also possible. In\naddition, the Fund may, from time\nto time, enter into transactions\nin which BFA or an Affiliate or\nits or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by\nclients advised or managed by BFA\nor its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by\none or more clients or by BFA or\nits Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment\nstrategies of the Fund. The\nFund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or\ntheir internal policies designed\nto comply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Fund has retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as the\nsecurities lending agent for the\nFund to the extent that the Fund\nparticipates in the securities\nlending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nFund based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities,\nincluding investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral 20 for the\nloaned securities. In addition,\none or more Affiliates may be\namong the entities to which the\nFund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities under the securities\nlending program. It is also\npossible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients (including other funds\nand separately managed accounts)\nmay, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold\nshares of the Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in\nsome cases) expense ratio of the\nFund may be impacted by purchases\nand sales of the Fund by\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients. The activities of BFA\nand its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or\nemployees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. See the\nSAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares\nof the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund\nonly in Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof, as discussed\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only\nan Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the\nFund generally trade in the\nsecondary market in amounts less\nthan a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading\nduring the trading day. Shares\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies.\nThe Trust does not impose any\nminimum investment for shares of\nthe Fund purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. The Fund's shares trade\nunder the ticker symbol \u201c ARTY. \u201d\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange or other secondary\nmarket involves two types of\ncosts that may apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. The commission is\nfrequently a fixed amount and may\nbe a significant proportional\ncost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell small amounts of shares.\nIn addition, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d that is,\nany difference between the bid\nprice and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for\nshares of the Fund based on the\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower\nif the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and\nhigher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity (which is often the\ncase for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The\nFund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity of the underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund\ndoes not impose restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies\nand procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of 21\nFund shares because the Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its\nshares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline\nfor placing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\nHowever, the Fund has taken\ncertain measures ( e.g .,\nimposing transaction fees on\npurchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units and reserving the\nright to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to\nthe Fund, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in Fund\nshares occurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve\nthe Fund directly, and such\ntrading is unlikely to cause many\nof the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The\nnational securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares are\nlisted is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following\nholidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. The Fund\u2019s primary listing\nexchange is NYSE Arca. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nHowever, registered investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin the Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in SEC\nrules. In order for a registered\ninvestment company to invest in\nshares of the Fund beyond the\nlimitations of Section 12(d)(1)\nin reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, the registered\ninvestment company must, among\nother things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. Foreign\ninvestment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund\nonly up to the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action\nrelief. Book Entry. Shares of the\nFund are held in book-entry form,\nwhich means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The\nDepository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC\n\u201d ) or its nominee is the record\nowner of, and holds legal title\nto, all outstanding shares of the\nFund. Investors owning shares of\nthe Fund are beneficial owners as\nshown on the records of DTC or\nits participants. DTC serves as\nthe securities depository for\nshares of the Fund. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of shares,\nyou are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares\nregistered in your 22 name, and\nyou are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares.\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of shares, you must\nrely upon the procedures of DTC\nand its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities that you hold in book-\nentry or \u201c street name \u201d form.\nShare Prices. The trading prices\nof the Fund\u2019s shares in the\nsecondary market generally differ\nfrom the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and are\naffected by market forces such as\nthe supply of and demand for ETF\nshares and shares of underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\neconomic conditions and other\nfactors. Determination of Net\nAsset Value. The NAV of the Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, generally\nas of the close of regular\ntrading hours of the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d )\n(normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime) on each day that the NYSE\nis open for trading, based on\nprices at the time of closing,\nprovided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of the\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the net assets of\nthe Fund ( i.e. , the value of\nits total assets less total\nliabilities) by the total number\nof outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the\nnearest cent. The value of the\nsecurities and other assets and\nliabilities held by the Fund is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\n1940 Act. Equity securities and\nother equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at\nmarket value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last\nreported official closing price\nor, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded\nprice on the exchange or market\non which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nare valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-\ntraded closed-end funds or other\nETFs are valued at their most\nrecent closing price. Generally,\ntrading in non-U.S. securities\nand money market instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of regular trading hours of\nthe NYSE. The values of such\nsecurities used in computing the\nNAV of the Fund are determined as\nof such times. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue the Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. BFA may conclude that\na market quotation is not readily\navailable or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons, if a market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability is thinly traded, when\nthere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation, or if the\ntrading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable 23\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities\nof, the Fund. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of\nthe Fund\u2019s pricing time. Fair\nvalue represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nheld by the Fund is the amount\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing\nthe Fund\u2019s investments using fair\nvalue pricing will result in\nprices that may differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nin which the particular fair\nvalues were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in\na difference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Dividends and\nDistributions. General Policies.\nDividends from net investment\nincome, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a\nyear by the Fund. Distributions\nof net realized securities gains,\nif any, generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for the Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on shares of\nthe Fund are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof such shares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC participants\nand indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend\nReinvestment Service for use by\nbeneficial owners of the Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend\ndistributions. Beneficial owners\nshould contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and\ncosts of the service and the\ndetails of participation therein.\nBrokers may require beneficial\nowners to adhere to specific\nprocedures and timetables. If\nthis service is available and\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole shares of the\nFund purchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on\nFund 24 distributions and sales\nof shares. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about\nthe potential tax consequences of\nan investment in shares of the\nFund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\nthe Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund.\nUnless your investment in Fund\nshares is made through a tax-\nexempt entity or tax-deferred\nretirement account, such as an\nIRA, in which case your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxable when withdrawn, you need\nto be aware of the possible tax\nconsequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Fund\nshares. Taxes on Distributions.\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of the Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. Distributions by\nthe Fund of net long-term capital\ngains, if any, in excess of net\nshort-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are\ntaxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Distributions by the Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income are taxable to\nyou at long-term capital gain\nrates. Long-term capital gains\nand qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation\nat a maximum rate of 15% or 20%\nfor non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income\nexceeds certain threshold\namounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S.\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\nis imposed on \u201c net investment\nincome, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends,\nand net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000\n(or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates\nand trusts. Dividends will be\nqualified dividend income to you\nif they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and\nqualified non-U.S. corporations,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the\nstock of such corporations and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways.\nSubstitute dividends received by\nthe Fund with respect to\ndividends paid on securities lent\nout will not be qualified\ndividend income. For this\npurpose, a qualified non-U.S.\ncorporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for\nbenefits under a comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the U.S.,\nwhich includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the\nstock with respect to which the\ndividend was paid is readily\ntradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term\nexcludes a corporation that is a\npassive foreign investment\ncompany. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a RIC generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by the Fund\nfrom a real estate investment\ntrust ( \u201c REIT \u201d ) and\ndistributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the\nshareholder as ordinary income.\nHowever, for tax years beginning\nafter December 31, 2017 and\nbefore January 1, 2026, the Fund\nmay report dividends eligible for\na 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate\nU.S. 25 shareholders to the\nextent the Fund\u2019s income is\nderived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable\nFund expenses. For a dividend to\nbe treated as qualified dividend\nincome, the dividend must be\nreceived with respect to a share\nof stock held without being\nhedged by the Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund\nheld without being hedged by you,\nfor 61 days during the 121-day\nperiod beginning at the date\nwhich is 60 days before the date\non which such share becomes ex-\ndividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of\ncertain preferred stock, 91 days\nduring the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such\ndate. Fund distributions, to the\nextent attributable to dividends\nfrom U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends\nreceived deduction for Fund\nshareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nIn general, your distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax for the year when they\nare paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. If the Fund\u2019s\ndistributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable\nyear may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in\nexcess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not\nbe taxable but will reduce the\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain\nor lower capital loss when those\nshares on which the distribution\nwas received are sold. Once a\nshareholder's cost basis is\nreduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gain, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains earned\nby the Fund with respect to\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If more than 50% of the\ntotal assets of the Fund at the\nclose of a year consists of\nnon-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter\nwhere traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund\nmay \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. This means that\nyou would be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. For purposes of\nforeign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of the Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nIf you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. entity (other than\na pass-through entity to the\nextent owned by U.S. persons),\nthe Fund\u2019s ordinary income\ndividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\n26 applies, provided that\nwithholding tax will generally\nnot apply to any gain or income\nrealized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder in respect of any\ndistributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of shares of\nthe Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items\npaid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they\nagree to collect and disclose to\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain\nother foreign entities, unless\nthey certify certain information\nregarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial\ninstitutions will need to (i)\nenter into agreements with the\nIRS that state that they will\nprovide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification\nnumbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders, comply with\ndue diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of\nU.S. accounts, report to the IRS\ncertain information with respect\nto U.S. accounts maintained,\nagree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant\nforeign financial institutions or\nto account holders who fail to\nprovide the required information,\nand determine certain other\ninformation concerning their\naccount holders, or (ii) in the\nevent that an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign\nentities may need to report the\nname, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial\nU.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. If your Fund\nshares are loaned out pursuant to\na securities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends paid while the\nshares are held by the borrower\nas qualified dividend income. In\naddition, you may lose the\nability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund if your Fund shares are\nloaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If\nyou are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S., by law, backup\nwithholding at a 24% rate will\napply to your distributions and\nproceeds if you have not provided\na taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and\nmade other required\ncertifications. Taxes When Shares\nAre Sold. Currently, any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale\nof Fund shares is generally\ntreated as a long-term gain or\nloss if the shares have been held\nfor more than one year. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital\nloss on the sale of shares held\nfor six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect\nto such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of\nFund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net\ninvestment income \u201d for purposes\nof the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions. Prior\nto trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Fund are \u201c\ncreated \u201d at NAV by market\nmakers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size\nCreation Units or multiples\nthereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) has\nentered into an agreement with\nthe Fund's distributor, BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\naffiliate of BFA. An Authorized\nParticipant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency\nregistered with 27 the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the\nFund or one of its service\nproviders that allows such member\nor participant to place orders\nfor the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. A creation\ntransaction, which is subject to\nacceptance by the Distributor and\nthe Fund, generally takes place\nwhen an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into the Fund a\ndesignated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions (a \u201c creation basket \u201d\n), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing\nthe value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which\ntogether approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation\nUnits. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the\nFund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be\nsubstituted). The Fund generally\noffers Creation Units partially\nfor cash, but may, in certain\ncircumstances, offer Creation\nUnits solely for cash or solely\nin-kind. Except when aggregated\nin Creation Units, shares are not\nredeemable by the Fund. Creation\nand redemption baskets may differ\nand the Fund may accept \u201c custom\nbaskets. \u201d More information\nregarding custom baskets is\ncontained in the Fund's SAI. The\nprices at which creations and\nredemptions occur are based on\nthe next calculation of NAV after\na creation or redemption order is\nreceived in an acceptable form\nunder the authorized participant\nagreement. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Fund.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFund. In the event of a system\nfailure or other interruption,\nincluding disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized\nParticipants, orders to purchase\nor redeem Creation Units either\nmay not be executed according to\nthe Fund's instructions or may\nnot be executed at all, or the\nFund may not be able to place or\nchange orders. To the extent the\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends to\ncomply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests will\nbe sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration\nunder the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d\nas such term is defined in Rule\n144A under the 1933 Act, will not\nbe able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Creations and\nredemptions must be made through\na firm that is either a member of\nthe Continuous Net Settlement\nSystem of the National Securities\nClearing Corporation or a DTC\nparticipant that has executed an\nagreement with the Distributor\nwith respect to creations and\nredemptions of Creation Unit\naggregations. Information about\nthe procedures regarding creation\nand redemption of Creation Units\n(including the cut-off times for\nreceipt of creation and\nredemption orders) is included in\nthe Fund's SAI. Because new\nshares may be created and issued\non an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of the Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that\nsome activities on their part\nmay, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. Any\n28 determination of whether one\nis an underwriter must take into\naccount all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers who\nare not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution\n(as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part\nof an \u201c unsold allotment \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be unable\nto take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange members,\nthe prospectus delivery mechanism\nof Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding. Householding is an\noption available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a\nmethod of delivery, based on the\npreference of the individual\ninvestor, in which a single copy\nof certain shareholder documents\ncan be delivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if you\nare interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change\nyour householding status.\nDistribution The Distributor or\nits agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Fund. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are\npurchased or sold by the Fund.\nThe Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. BFA or its\naffiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems,\ndata provision services, or their\nmaking shares of the Fund and\ncertain other iShares funds\navailable to their customers\ngenerally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such\npayments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary,\nare not made by the Fund. Rather,\nsuch payments are made by BFA or\nits affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or\nindirectly in part from fees paid\nby the iShares funds complex.\nPayments of this type are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-\nsharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it\nrecommends or makes available, or\nthe level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the\npayments or other financial\nincentives it is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives\noffered or made to an\nintermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary\nand its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the\nFund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More\ninformation regarding these\npayments is contained in the\nFund's SAI. Please contact your\nsalesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information\nregarding any such payments his\nor her firm may receive from BFA\nor its affiliates. 29\n\nFinancial Highlights The\nfinancial highlights table is\nintended to help investors\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial\nperformance for the past five\nyears. Certain information\nreflects financial results for a\nsingle share of the Fund. The\ntotal returns in the table\nrepresent the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or\nlost) on an investment in the\nFund, assuming reinvestment of\nall dividends and distributions.\nThis

Investment Company Act File\nNo.: 811-09729\n\nIS-P-ARTY-0824\n\niShares \u00ae\nNotice to Shareholders The Board of Trustees\nof the Trust approved a proposal to close and\nliquidate the iShares Virtual Work and Life\nMultisector ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ). After market\nclose on August 12, 2024, the Fund will cease\nthe creation and redemption of Creation Units.\nTrading in the Fund will be halted prior to\nmarket open on August 13, 2024. Proceeds of\nthe liquidation are currently scheduled to be\nsent to Fund shareholders on or around August\n15, 2024 (the \u201c Liquidation Date \u201d ). While\nthe Fund is in the process of liquidating its\nportfolio, which is anticipated to commence\nprior to August 12, 2024, the Fund will hold\ncash and securities that will not be\nconsistent with its investment objective and\nstrategies and is likely to incur higher\ntracking error than is typical for the Fund.\nFurthermore, the Trust cannot assure that\nthere will be a trading market for Fund shares\nbetween market close on August 12, 2024 and\nthe Liquidation Date because Fund shares will\nnot be traded on the primary listing exchange\nidentified in the Prospectus for the Fund (the\n\u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ) during that period.\nShareholders may sell their holdings of the\nFund on its Listing Exchange until market\nclose on August 12, 2024 and may incur the\nusual and customary brokerage commissions\nassociated with the sale of Fund shares. As of\nthe Liquidation Date, shares of the Fund will\nbe individually redeemed. If you hold Fund\nshares on the Liquidation Date, the Fund will\nautomatically redeem your shares for cash\nbased on the net asset value of the Fund as of\nthe close of business on August 12, 2024,\nwhich will include any dividends or\ndistributions calculated as of that date. If\nyou are subject to U.S. federal income tax,\nthe liquidation of the Fund will result in one\nor more taxable events for you. A sale or\nexchange of Fund shares prior to the\nLiquidation Date will generally give rise to a\ncapital gain or loss to you for federal income\ntax purposes. In connection with the\nliquidation, the Fund may declare taxable\ndistributions of its investment income or\ntaxable distributions of its net capital gain.\nAny liquidation proceeds paid to you should\ngenerally be treated as received by you in\nexchange for your shares and will therefore\ngenerally give rise to a capital gain or loss,\ndepending on your tax basis. Please consult\nyour personal tax advisor about the potential\ntax consequences.

Each Fund offers and issues shares at their\nnet asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Funds are\nlisted for trading on national securities\nexchanges (a \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ) such as\nCboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c Cboe BZX \u201d ), The\nNasdaq Stock Market LLC ( \u201c Nasdaq \u201d ) or NYSE\nArca, Inc. ( \u201c NYSE Arca \u201d ). Shares of each\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI) (other than the iShares MSCI China A\nETF, which currently redeems\n\n1\n\nCreation Units of its shares solely for cash).\nCreation Units typically are a specified\nnumber of shares, generally ranging from\n40,000 to 200,000 or multiples thereof. The\nTrust reserves the right to permit or require\nthat creations and redemptions of shares are\neffected fully or partially in cash and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\ncash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin each Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of each Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe applicable Prospectus. Shares of each Fund\nare listed for trading, and trade throughout\nthe day, on the Listing Exchange and in other\nsecondary markets. Shares of each Fund may\nalso be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges.\nThere can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Listing Exchange necessary\nto maintain the listing of shares of any Fund\nwill continue to be met. The Listing Exchange\nmay, but is not required to, remove the shares\nof a Fund from listing if, among other things:\n(i) following the initial 12-month period\nbeginning upon the commencement of trading of\nFund shares, there are fewer than 50 record\nand/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund;\n(ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate\nin reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment\nCompany Act; (iii) any of the other listing\nrequirements are not continuously maintained;\nor (iv) any event shall occur or condition\nshall exist that, in the opinion of the\nListing Exchange, makes further dealings on\nthe Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing\nExchange will also remove shares of a Fund\nfrom listing and trading upon termination of\nthe Fund. As in the case of other publicly-\ntraded securities, when you buy or sell shares\nof a Fund through a broker, you may incur a\nbrokerage commission determined by that\nbroker, as well as other charges. The Trust\nreserves the right to adjust the share price\nof the Funds in the future to maintain\nconvenient trading ranges for investors. Any\nadjustments would be accomplished through\nstock splits or reverse stock splits, which\nwould have no effect on the net assets of the\nFunds or an investor's equity interest in the\nFunds. Investment Strategies and Risks Each of\nthe iShares Breakthrough Environmental\nSolutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF,\niShares Core MSCI International Developed\nMarkets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total\nInternational Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity\nand Tech ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF,\niShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI\nACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All\nCountry Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares MSCI China\nA ETF, iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare\nETF, iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and\niShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector ETF\nseeks to achieve its objective by investing\nprimarily in securities issued by issuers that\ncompose its relevant Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. Each Fund operates as an index fund and\nis not actively managed. Adverse performance\nof a security in a Fund\u2019s portfolio will\nordinarily not result in the elimination of\nthe security from the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Each\nFund engages in representative sampling, which\nis investing in a sample of securities\nselected by BFA to have a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nFund's Underlying Index. Securities selected\nhave aggregate investment characteristics\n(based on market capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability, earnings valuation and\nyield) and liquidity measures similar to those\nof the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that\nuses representative sampling generally does\nnot hold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index.\n\n2\n\nAlthough the Funds do not seek leveraged\nreturns, certain instruments used by the Funds\nmay have a leveraging effect as described\nbelow. Borrowing. Each Fund may borrow for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including to\nmeet payments due from redemptions or to\nfacilitate the settlement of securities or\nother transactions. The iShares Breakthrough\nEnvironmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI\nTotal International Stock ETF, iShares\nCybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares\nExponential Technologies ETF, iShares Future\nAI & Tech ETF, iShares Future Cloud 5G and\nTech ETF, iShares Genomics Immunology and\nHealthcare ETF, iShares Global Equity Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI\nex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon\nTarget ETF, iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex\nJapan ETF, iShares MSCI China A ETF, iShares\nSelf-Driving EV and Tech ETF and iShares\nVirtual Work and Life Multisector ETF, along\nwith certain other iShares funds, have entered\ninto a syndicated line of credit with the Bank\nof New York Mellon ( \u201c BNY \u201d ), which serves\nas administrative agent for itself and the\nother banks. The syndicated line of credit may\nbe used for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding redemption, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings. Interest\nrates related to the syndicated line of credit\nare based on the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ) published by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York plus a spread.\nPursuant to the terms of the credit agreement,\nif SOFR were to cease being published or\nrepresentative, it would be replaced by a rate\nbased on an alternate benchmark selected by\nBNY. The purchase of securities while\nborrowings are outstanding may have the effect\nof leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of\nleverage increases a Fund\u2019s exposure to risk,\nand borrowed funds are subject to interest\ncosts that will reduce net income. Purchasing\nsecurities while borrowings are outstanding\ncreates special risks, such as the potential\nfor greater volatility in the NAV of Fund\nshares and in the yield on a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nIn addition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\na Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the amount\navailable (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\na Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank\nor may result in a Fund being subject to\ncovenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. Each Fund does not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of each Fund's assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may\nenter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of the\nFund's return with the performance of the\nUnderlying Index and may lower a Fund\u2019s\nreturn. A Fund could experience losses if the\nvalue of its currency forwards, options or\nfutures positions were poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if\n\n3\n\nit could not close out its positions because\nof an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, a Fund could incur transaction\ncosts, including trading commissions, in\nconnection with certain non-U.S. currency\ntransactions. Diversification Status. The\nfollowing table sets forth the diversification\nstatus of each Fund:\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds    Non-Diversified Funds  \n  iShares Core MSCI    iShares Breakthrough   \n  EAFE ETF             Environmental          \n                       Solutions ETF          \n  iShares Core MSCI                           \n  International        iShares Cybersecurity  \n  Developed            and Tech ETF           \n  MarketsETF                                  \n  iShares Core MSCI    iShares Genomics       \n  Total International  Immunology and         \n  Stock ETF            Healthcare ETF         \n  iShares Exponential  iShares Neuroscience   \n  Technologies ETF     and Healthcare ETF     \n  iShares Future AI &  iShares Self-Driving   \n  Tech ETF             EV and Tech ETF        \n  iShares Future                              \n  Cloud 5G and Tech                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Global                              \n  Equity Factor ETF                           \n  iShares MSCI ACWI                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI ACWI                           \n  ex U.S. ETF                                 \n  iShares MSCI ACWI                           \n  Low Carbon Target                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI All                            \n  Country Asia ex                             \n  Japan ETF*                                  \n  iShares MSCI China                          \n  A ETF                                       \n  iShares Virtual                             \n  Work and Life                               \n  Multisector ETF                             \n                                              \n* The iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan\nETF intends to be diversified in approximately\nthe same proportion as its Underlying Index is\ndiversified. The iShares MSCI All Country Asia\nex Japan ETF may become non-diversified, as\ndefined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of\na change in relative market capitalization or\nindex weighting of one or more constituents of\nits Underlying Index. Shareholder approval\nwill not be sought if the iShares MSCI All\nCountry Asia ex Japan ETF crosses from\ndiversified to non-diversified status due\nsolely to a change in its relative market\ncapitalization or index weighting of one or\nmore constituents of its Underlying Index. The\nFunds disclose their portfolio holdings and\nweightings at www.iShares.com. A fund\nclassified as \u201c diversified \u201d under the 1940\nAct may not purchase securities of an issuer\n(other than (i) obligations issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities and (ii)\nsecurities of other investment companies) if,\nwith respect to 75% of its total assets, (a)\nmore than 5% of the fund\u2019s total assets would\nbe invested in securities of that issuer or\n(b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of that issuer.\nWith respect to the remaining 25% of its total\nassets, the fund may invest more than 5% of\nits assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act,\na fund cannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval. However, while the\niShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF is\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d under\napplicable no-action relief from the SEC\nstaff, the fund may become non-diversified, as\ndefined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of\na change in relative market capitalization or\nindex weighting of one or more constituents of\nits Underlying Index and such a change does\nnot require shareholder approval. A \u201c non-\ndiversified \u201d fund is a fund that is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect a fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject the fund\u2019s shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby more diversified investment companies. Each\nFund (whether diversified or non-diversified)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Funds and may make it less\nlikely that the Funds will meet their\nrespective investment objectives.\n\n4\n\nFutures, Options on Futures and Securities\nOptions. Futures contracts, options on futures\nand securities options may be used by a Fund\nto simulate investment in its Underlying\nIndex, to facilitate trading or to reduce\ntransaction costs. Each Fund may enter into\nfutures contracts and options on futures that\nare traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. Each Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFunds, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. Certain of the Funds may purchase and\nwrite put and call options on futures\ncontracts that are traded on an exchange as a\nhedge against changes in value of their\nportfolio securities or in anticipation of the\npurchase of securities, and may enter into\nclosing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by a Fund to obtain access to securities\nin its Underlying Index or to dispose of\nsecurities in its Underlying Index at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that provided by its Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s objective of\ntracking its Underlying Index. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives a holder the right\nto sell a specific security at an exercise\nprice within a specified period of time. The\ninitial purchaser of a call option pays the \u201c\nwriter \u201d a premium, which is paid at the time\nof purchase and is retained by the writer\nwhether or not such option is exercised. Each\nFund may purchase put options to hedge its\nportfolio against the risk of a decline in the\nmarket value of securities held and may\npurchase call options to hedge against an\nincrease in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\n\n5\n\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the Fund exceeds one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). A Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the return of the securities\nloaned. Each Fund receives, by way of\nsubstitute payment, the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities that it would have otherwise\nreceived if the securities were not on loan.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower may be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Funds are compensated by any\npositive difference between the amount earned\non the reinvestment of cash collateral and the\nfee paid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for the Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Funds\u2019\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements.\n\n6\n\nLiquidity Risk Management. Rule 22e-4 under\nthe Investment Company Act (the \u201c Liquidity\nRule \u201d ) requires open-end funds, including\nexchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the\nFunds, to establish a liquidity risk\nmanagement program (the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d\n) and enhance disclosures regarding fund\nliquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule,\nthe Funds have implemented a Liquidity\nProgram, and the Board, including a majority\nof the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has\nappointed BFA as the administrator of the\nLiquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews each Fund\u2019s liquidity\nrisk and classifies each investment held by a\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that a Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by a Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The liquidity\nof a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities.\nEach Fund intends to purchase publicly traded\ncommon stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the\nextent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S.\nissuers, the Fund's investments in such stocks\nmay be in the form of American Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d ) and European Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d ) (collectively, \u201c\ndepositary receipts \u201d ). Depositary receipts\nare receipts, typically issued by a bank or\ntrust issuer, which evidence ownership of\nunderlying securities issued by a non-U.S.\nissuer. Depositary receipts may not\nnecessarily be denominated in the same\ncurrency as their underlying securities. ADRs\ntypically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust\ncompany and evidence ownership of underlying\nsecurities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs,\nwhich are sometimes referred to as continental\ndepositary receipts, are receipts issued in\nEurope, typically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose a Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries; and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds.\n\n7\n\nThe iShares Breakthrough Environmental\nSolutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF,\niShares Core MSCI International Developed\nMarkets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total\nInternational Stock ETF, iShares Future Cloud\n5G and Tech ETF, iShares Exponential\nTechnologies ETF, iShares Global Equity Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI\nex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon\nTarget ETF and iShares MSCI All Country Asia\nex Japan ETF (the \u201c No-Action Letter Funds \u201d )\nmay also have investments in \u201c underlying\nfunds \u201d (and such underlying funds themselves\nmay invest in underlying funds) not advised by\nBFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d for purposes\nof the no-action letter referenced below may\ninclude, but is not limited to, certain\nsecuritized vehicles, mortgage or\ninternational real estate investment trusts (\n\u201c REITs \u201d ), business development companies\nand investment companies that may invest in\nCFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing),\nand therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as\ncommodity pools. BFA may not have transparency\ninto the holdings of these underlying funds\nbecause they are not advised by BFA. To\naddress this issue of lack of transparency,\nthe CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on\nNovember 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a\nfund that invests in such underlying funds and\nthat would otherwise have filed a claim of\nexclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay\nregistration as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nuntil six months from the date on which the\nCFTC issues additional guidance on the\ntreatment of CFTC Derivatives held by\nunderlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-\nAction Letter Funds, has filed a claim with\nthe CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-\naction relief. Accordingly, BFA is not\ncurrently subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of the Funds.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in a Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions (e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities (e.g., firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if a Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ).\n\n8\n\nRepurchase Agreements. A repurchase agreement\nis an instrument under which the purchaser (\ni.e. , a Fund) acquires a security and the\nseller agrees, at the time of the sale, to\nrepurchase the security at a mutually agreed-\nupon time and price, thereby determining the\nyield during the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund, should it decide to utilize them. Such\nrisks are not unique to the Funds, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds\nseek to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, a Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition a Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by a Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund\u2019s investment\nin registered investment companies is\ngenerally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect\nto any one investment company; and (iii) 10%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect to\ninvestment companies in the aggregate. Other\ninvestment companies in which a Fund may\ninvest can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable).\n\n9\n\nShort-Term Instruments and Temporary\nInvestments. Each Fund may invest in short-\nterm instruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d\n), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time deposits\nand other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S.\nbanks (including non-U.S. branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated, at the date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by\nMoody's \u00ae Investors Service, Inc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by\nFitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1 \u201d by Standard &\nPoor's \u00ae Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary\nof S&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P Global Ratings \u201d\n), or if unrated, of comparable quality as\ndetermined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of\nthese instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Swap Agreements. Swap agreements\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on a pre-determined\nunderlying investment or notional amount. In\nreturn, the other party agrees to make\nperiodic payments to the first party based on\nthe return (or a differential in rate of\nreturn) earned or realized on the underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. Swap agreements\nwill usually be performed on a net basis, with\na Fund receiving or paying only the net amount\nof the two payments. The net amount of the\nexcess, if any, of a Fund\u2019s obligations over\nits entitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis. Certain of the Funds\nmay enter into swap agreements, including\ncurrency swaps, interest rate swaps and index\nswaps. The use of swaps is a highly\nspecialized activity that involves investment\ntechniques and risks different from those\nassociated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. These transactions generally do\nnot involve the delivery of securities or\nother underlying assets. Tracking Stocks. A\ntracking stock is a separate class of common\nstock whose value is linked to a specific\nbusiness unit or operating division within a\nlarger company and is designed to \u201c track \u201d\nthe performance of such business unit or\ndivision. The tracking stock may pay dividends\nto shareholders independent of the parent\ncompany. The parent company, rather than the\nbusiness unit or division, generally is the\nissuer of tracking stock. However, holders of\nthe tracking stock may not have the same\nrights as holders of the company\u2019s common\nstock. Future Developments. The Board may, in\nthe future, authorize each Fund to invest in\nsecurities contracts and investments, other\nthan those listed in this SAI and in the\napplicable Prospectuses, provided they are\nconsistent with each Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in the\napplicable Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Cloud-based\nComputing and Data Storage Risk. Companies\ninvolved in, or exposed to, cloud-based\ncomputing and data storage-related businesses\nmay have limited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources or personnel. These\ncompanies face intense competition and\npotentially rapid product obsolescence, and\nmany depend on retaining and growing the\nconsumer base of their respective products and\nservices. Many companies involved in, or\nexposed to, cloud-based computing and data\n\n10\n\nstorage-related businesses (as determined by\nthe Index Provider) may be exposed, directly\nor indirectly, to the market and business\nrisks of other industries or sectors, and the\nFund may be adversely affected by negative\ndevelopments impacting those companies,\nindustries or sectors. These companies may\ndepend on intellectual property rights and may\nbe adversely affected by loss or impairment of\nthose rights. There can be no assurance that\ncompanies involved in cloud-based computing\nand data storage will be able to successfully\nprotect their intellectual property to prevent\nthe misappropriation of their technology, or\nthat competitors will not develop technology\nthat is substantially similar or superior.\nCloud-based computing and data storage\ncompanies also depend on a number of third\nparties to provide services to data centers,\nwhich, if interrupted, may impact products and\nservices. These companies are also potential\ntargets for cyberattacks, which may have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the performance\nof these companies. These companies may also\nbe affected by prolonged power outages or\nshortages, increased costs of energy, or\ngeneral lack of availability of electrical\nsources. Cloud-based computing and data\nstorage companies, especially smaller\ncompanies, may be more volatile than companies\nnot in the technology sector. Legal and\nregulatory changes, particularly related to\ninformation privacy and data protection, may\nimpact the products or services of cloud-based\ncomputing and data storage companies. Cloud-\nbased computing may face increasing regulatory\nscrutiny and legal liability, which may limit\nthe development of this technology and impede\nthe growth of companies that develop or use\nthis technology. Similarly, the collection of\ndata from consumers and other sources, and\nstorage of that data, may face increased\nscrutiny as regulators consider how data may\nbe collected, stored, safeguarded and used. In\nthe event of a data breach or a similar\nincident, cloud-based computing and data\nstorage companies may face legal liability.\nCommodities Investment Risk. Exposure to\ncommodities markets may subject a Fund to\ngreater volatility than investments in\ntraditional securities. The commodities\nmarkets have experienced periods of extreme\nvolatility. Similar future market conditions\nmay result in rapid and substantial valuation\nincreases or decreases in a Fund\u2019s holdings.\nThe commodities markets may fluctuate widely\nbased on a variety of factors. Movements in\ncommodity investment prices are outside of a\nFund's control and may not be anticipated by\nBFA. Price movements may be influenced by,\namong other things: governmental,\nagricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and\nexchange control programs and policies;\nchanging market and economic conditions;\nmarket liquidity; weather and climate\nconditions, including droughts and floods;\nlivestock disease; changing supply and demand\nrelationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities. A decrease in the\nproduction of a physical commodity or a\ndecrease in the volume of such commodity\navailable for transportation, mining,\nprocessing, storage or distribution may\nadversely impact the financial performance of\na commodity or commodity-related company that\ndevotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather.\n\n11\n\nThe commodity markets are subject to temporary\ndistortions and other disruptions due to,\namong other factors, lack of liquidity, the\nparticipation of speculators, and government\nregulation and other actions. U.S. futures\nexchanges and some foreign exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation in futures contract\nprices which may occur in a single business\nday (generally referred to as \u201c daily price\nfluctuation limits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum\nprice of a contract as a result of these\nlimits is referred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If\nthe limit price has been reached in a\nparticular contract, no trades may be made\nbeyond the limit price. Limit prices have the\neffect of precluding trading in a particular\ncontract or forcing the liquidation of\ncontracts at disadvantageous times or prices.\nCurrency Risk. Because each Fund's NAV is\ndetermined on the basis of the U.S. dollar,\ninvestors may lose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which a Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if\nthe local currency value of a Fund\u2019s holdings\nin that market increases. Generally, when the\nU.S. dollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is\nworth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the\nU.S. dollar decreases in value against a\nforeign currency, a security denominated in\nthat currency gains value because the currency\nis worth more U.S. dollars. This risk,\ngenerally known as \u201c currency risk, \u201d means\nthat a strong U.S. dollar will reduce returns\nfor U.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar\nwill increase those returns. Foreign exchange\ntransactions involve a significant degree of\nrisk and the markets in which foreign exchange\ntransactions are effected are highly volatile,\nhighly specialized and highly technical.\nSignificant changes, including changes in\nliquidity and prices, can occur in such\nmarkets within very short periods of time,\noften within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Fund\u2019s performance\nand may lower a Fund\u2019s return. A Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforward positions are poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it cannot close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket. In addition, a Fund could incur\ntransaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nDividend-Paying Stock Risk. Investing in\ndividend-paying stocks involves the risk that\nsuch stocks may fall out of favor with\ninvestors and underperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken.\n\n12\n\nMoney Market Instruments Risk. A Fund may hold\nmoney market instruments. The value of money\nmarket instruments may be affected by changes\nin interest rates or in the credit ratings of\nthe investments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Regulation of Offshore Renminbi\nand Remittance. The offshore renminbi ( \u201c CNH\n\u201d ) market is a free market and the CNH\nexchange rate is determined by market forces.\nNevertheless, supply and demand for CNH are\ninfluenced by policies on cross-border\nrenminbi flows. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited ( \u201c\nBOCHK \u201d ) is the only clearing bank for CNH in\nHong Kong. The remittance of renminbi into the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c China \u201d or the\n\u201c PRC \u201d ) and the repatriation of renminbi out\nof the PRC are dependent on the operational\nsystems and procedures developed by the BOCHK\nfor such purposes and there is no assurance\nthat there will not be delays in remittance\nand/or repatriation. Any delays in, or\nrestrictions imposed on, the remittance and/or\nrepatriation of the Fund\u2019s cash into or out of\nthe PRC will have an impact on the Fund\u2019s\nability to purchase stocks required in order\nto effectively track the Underlying Index and\nmay increase the level of tracking error. Such\ndelays or restrictions will also impact the\nFund\u2019s ability to repatriate cash for the\npurposes of or otherwise in connection with\nredemption requests. Risk of Derivatives. A\nderivative is a financial contract, the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, such as a\nsecurity, a commodity (such as gold or\nsilver), a currency or an index (a measure of\nvalue or rates, such as the S&P 500 \u00ae or the\nprime lending rate). A Fund may invest in\nfutures contracts, securities options and\nother derivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus a Fund\u2019s losses may be\ngreater if it invests in derivatives than if\nit invests only in conventional securities.\nDerivatives are also subject to counterparty\nrisk, which is the risk that the other party\nin the transaction will not fulfill its\ncontractual obligations. Derivatives generally\ninvolve the incurrence of leverage.\n\n13\n\nWhen a derivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that a Fund holds or is committed to\npurchase, any loss generated by the derivative\ngenerally should be substantially offset by\ngains on the hedged investment, and vice\nversa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate\nlosses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains\nand, in some cases, hedging can cause losses\nthat are not offset by gains, and a Fund will\nrecognize losses on both the investment and\nthe hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to\nimperfect matching between the derivative and\nthe underlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that a Fund's hedging transactions,\nwhich entail additional transaction costs,\nwill be effective. Risk of Equity Securities.\nAn investment in a Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding of the risks inherent in an\ninvestment in equity securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of stock markets may deteriorate\n(either of which may cause a decrease in the\nvalue of the portfolio securities and thus in\nthe value of shares of the Fund). Common\nstocks are susceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in each\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide. Risk of Futures\nand Options on Futures Transactions. There are\nseveral risks accompanying the utilization of\nfutures contracts and options on futures\ncontracts. A position in futures contracts and\noptions on futures contracts may be closed\nonly on the exchange on which the contract was\nmade (or a linked exchange). While each Fund\nplans to utilize futures contracts only if an\nactive market exists for such contracts, there\nis no guarantee that a liquid market will\nexist for the contract at a specified time.\nFutures contracts, by definition, project\nprice levels in the future and not current\nlevels of valuation; therefore, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the future and the\nmovement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, a Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if a Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to the Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or\n\n14\n\noption. The purchase of put or call options\nwill be based upon predictions by BFA as to\nanticipated trends, which predictions could\nprove to be incorrect. Because the futures\nmarket generally imposes less burdensome\nmargin requirements than the securities\nmarket, an increased amount of participation\nby speculators in the futures market could\nresult in price fluctuations. Certain\nfinancial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. An\ninvestment in any of the Funds involves risks\nsimilar to those of investing in portfolios of\nequity securities traded on non-U.S.\nexchanges. These risks include market\nfluctuations caused by such factors as\neconomic and political developments in those\nforeign countries, changes in interest rates\nand perceived trends in stock prices.\nInvesting in securities issued by issuers\ndomiciled in countries other than the domicile\nof the investor and denominated in currencies\nother than an investor\u2019s local currency\nentails certain considerations and risks not\ntypically encountered by the investor in\nmaking investments in its home country and in\nthat country\u2019s currency. These considerations\ninclude favorable or unfavorable changes in\ninterest rates, currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations and the costs\nthat may be incurred in connection with\nconversions between various currencies.\nInvesting in any of the Funds also involves\ncertain risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in a fund whose\nportfolio contains exclusively securities of\nU.S. issuers. These risks include generally\nless liquid and less efficient securities\nmarkets; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Funds; higher transaction and custody\ncosts; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy and businesses; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that a Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations. If such a default\noccurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect such Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , a Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). A Fund is\nrequired to post and collect variation margin\nand initial margin (comprised of specified\nliquid securities subject to haircuts) in\nconnection with trading of OTC swaps. These\nrequirements may raise the costs for a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in swaps. Securities Lending Risk.\nA Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for a Fund. Tracking\nError Risk. A Fund may be subject to tracking\nerror, which is the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the applicable\nunderlying index. Tracking error may occur\nbecause of differences between the securities\nand other instruments held in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in its applicable\nunderlying index, pricing differences,\ntransaction costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash, differences in\ntiming of the accrual of or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to a Fund\u2019s shareholders,\nthe requirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the applicable underlying index or\nthe costs to a Fund of complying with various\nnew or existing regulatory requirements. This\nrisk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Tracking error also may\nresult because a Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while its applicable underlying\nindex does not. Tracking error may occur due\nto differences between the methodologies used\nin calculating the value of the applicable\nUnderlying Index and determining a Fund\u2019s NAV.\n\n15\n\nWhen an issuer is introduced by an index\nprovider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA\nmay conduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such a\nfund will be subject to increased tracking\nerror due to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. BFA\u2019s underweighting or excluding such\nsecurities may result in a decline in a Fund\u2019s\nnet asset value. The application of the\nabovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund and its Underlying Index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Index or a\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\na Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Volatility Risk.\nThe value of a security may fluctuate due to\nfactors affecting markets generally or\nparticular industries. This volatility may\naffect a Fund's NAV. Although the Underlying\nIndex was created to seek lower absolute\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that these\nstrategies will be successful. An underlying\nindex's index provider may be unsuccessful in\ncreating an index that minimizes volatility,\nand there is a risk that each Fund may\nexperience more than minimum volatility.\nSecurities in the Funds' portfolios may be\nsubject to price volatility and their prices\nmay not be any less volatile than the market\nas a whole and could be more volatile. Events\nor financial circumstances affecting\nindividual securities or sectors may increase\nthe volatility of the Funds. Risk of Investing\nin Small-Capitalization Companies. Stock\nprices of small-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile than those of larger\ncompanies, and, therefore, a Fund's share\nprice may be more volatile than that of funds\nthat invest a larger percentage of their\nassets in stocks issued by large-\ncapitalization or mid-capitalization\ncompanies. Stock prices of small-\ncapitalization companies are generally more\nvulnerable than those of large-capitalization\nor mid-capitalization companies to adverse\nbusiness and economic developments. The stocks\nof small-capitalization companies may be\nthinly traded, making it difficult for the\nFunds to buy and sell them. In addition,\nsmall-capitalization companies are typically\nless financially stable than larger, more\nestablished companies and may depend on a\nsmall number of essential personnel, making\nthem more vulnerable to loss of personnel.\nSmall-capitalization companies also normally\nhave less diverse product lines than large-\ncapitalization companies and are more\nsusceptible to adverse developments concerning\ntheir products. Indian Economic Trading\nPartner Risk. The Indian economy is subject to\na considerable degree of economic, political\nand social instability. Disparities of wealth,\nthe pace of economic liberalization and\nethnic, religious and racial disaffection may\nlead to social turmoil, violence and labor\nunrest in India. In addition, India continues\nto experience religious and border disputes as\nwell as separatist movements in certain Indian\nstates. Unanticipated political or social\ndevelopments may have an adverse effect on\nIndia\u2019s economy. The Indian government has\nimplemented significant economic reforms in\norder to liberalize trade policy, promote\nforeign investment in the Indian economy,\ncontrol the rate of inflation, reduce\ngovernment control of the economy and develop\nmarket mechanisms. There can be no assurance\nthese reforms will continue or that they will\nbe effective. The Indian government has\nexperienced chronic structural public sector\ndeficits. High amounts of debt and public\nspending may stifle Indian economic growth or\ncause prolonged periods of recession. The\nIndian economy has grown rapidly during the\npast several years and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained.\nIndia may experience substantial (and, in some\ncases, extremely high) rates of inflation or\neconomic recessions causing a negative effect\non the Indian economy. Risk of Investing in\nAfrica. Investments in securities of issuers\nin certain African countries involve\nheightened risks including, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, civil war, and social\ninstability as a result of religious, ethnic\nand/or socio-economic unrest or widespread\noutbreaks of disease and, in certain\ncountries, genocidal warfare. Certain\ncountries in Africa generally have less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries, and, consequently,\nthe risks of investing in foreign securities\nare magnified in such countries. Because\nsecurities markets of countries in Africa are\ngenerally underdeveloped and are generally\nless correlated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated\n\n16\n\nwith market volatility, lower market\ncapitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether. Market volatility may\nalso be heightened by the actions of a small\nnumber of investors. Brokerage firms in\ncertain countries in Africa may be fewer in\nnumber and less established than brokerage\nfirms in more developed markets. Since a Fund\nmay need to effect securities transactions\nthrough these brokerage firms, the Fund is\nsubject to the risk that these brokerage firms\nwill not be able to fulfill their obligations\nto the Fund ( i.e., counterparty risk). This\nrisk is magnified to the extent that a Fund\neffects securities transactions through a\nsingle brokerage firm or a small number of\nbrokerage firms. Certain governments in\nAfrican countries restrict or control to\nvarying degrees the ability of foreign\ninvestors to invest in securities of issuers\nlocated or operating in those countries.\nMoreover, certain countries in Africa require\ngovernmental approval or special licenses\nprior to investment by foreign investors and\nmay limit the amount of investment by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer, and may limit such foreign investment\nto a certain class of securities of an issuer\nthat may have less advantageous rights than\nthe classes available for purchase by domestic\ninvestors of the countries and/or impose\nadditional taxes on foreign investors. A delay\nin obtaining a government approval or a\nlicense would delay investments in a\nparticular country, and, as a result, a Fund\nmay not be able to invest in certain\nsecurities while approval is pending. The\ngovernment of a particular country may also\nwithdraw or decline to renew a license that\nenables a Fund to invest in such country.\nThese factors make investing in issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nsignificantly riskier than investing in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\ncountries, and any one of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa are generally not subject\nto the same rules and regulations as issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. Therefore, there may be less\nfinancial and other information publicly\navailable with regard to issuers located or\noperating in countries in Africa and such\nissuers are generally not subject to the\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which a Fund may invest\nmay levy withholding or other taxes on income\nsuch as dividends, interest and realized\ncapital gains. Although in certain countries\nin Africa a portion of these taxes are\nrecoverable, the non-recovered portion of\nforeign withholding taxes will reduce the\nincome received from investments in such\ncountries. Investment in countries in Africa\nmay be subject to a greater degree of risk\nassociated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, a\nFund could be adversely affected by delays in,\nor a refusal to grant, required governmental\napproval for repatriation of capital, as well\nas by the application to the Fund of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\na Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local\ngovernment approvals or take other actions,\neach of which may involve additional costs to\na Fund. Securities laws in many countries in\nAfrica are relatively new and unsettled and,\nconsequently, there is a risk of rapid and\nunpredictable change in laws regarding foreign\ninvestment, securities regulation, title to\nsecurities and shareholder rights.\nAccordingly, foreign investors may be\nadversely affected by new or amended laws and\nregulations. In addition, there may be no\nsingle centralized securities exchange on\nwhich securities are traded in certain\ncountries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn\n\n17\n\naddition, certain issuers located in countries\nin Africa in which a Fund invests may operate\nin, or have dealings with, countries subject\nto sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the\nU.S. government and the United Nations, and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. A\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Africa may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nAfrica. Some countries in Africa may be\naffected by a greater degree of public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Political instability and protests in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East have caused\nand may in the future cause significant\ndisruptions to many industries. In addition,\nthe outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa\nseverely challenged health care industries in\nthose countries and adversely impacted the\nregion\u2019s economy due to quarantines and\ndisruptions of trade, which has further\nincreased instability in the region. This\ninstability has demonstrated that political\nand social unrest can spread quickly through\nthe region, and that developments in one\ncountry can influence the political events in\nneighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in a Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse\n\n18\n\neconomic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by a relevant Fund. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\ndependent on trading with certain key trading\npartners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in Central and South America. The\neconomies of certain Central and South\nAmerican countries have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility,\ninflation, currency devaluations, government\ndefaults, regime changes, high unemployment\nrates and political instability which can\nadversely affect issuers in these countries.\nIn addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof exports for the regions and many economies\nin these regions are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on other countries\nof these regions. The governments of certain\ncountries in Central and South America may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on the securities\nin which a Fund invests. Diplomatic\ndevelopments may also adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Central\nand South America. Some countries in Central\nand South America may be affected by public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which a Fund invests may be the\nsubject of sanctions (for example, the U.S.\nhas imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan\nindividuals, corporate entities and the\nVenezuelan government) or have dealings with\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. A Fund\nmay be adversely affected if it invests in\nsuch issuers. Risk of Investing in China.\nInvestments in securities of companies\ndomiciled in China involve a high degree of\nrisk and special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities markets. Such heightened risks\ninclude, among others, an authoritarian\ngovernment, popular unrest associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions, the impact of regional\nconflict on the economy and hostile relations\nwith neighboring countries. Military\nconflicts, either in response to internal\nsocial unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs\n\n19\n\nor cyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which a\nFund invests. China could be affected by\nmilitary events on the Korean peninsula or\ninternal instability within North Korea. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking, and investing in\nChina involves risk of loss due to\nexpropriation, nationalization, confiscation\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested. A Fund may\ninvest in securities issued by variable\ninterest entities ( \u201c VIEs \u201d ), which are\nsubject to the investment risks associated\nwith the underlying Chinese operating company.\nA VIE enters into service contracts and other\ncontracts with the Chinese operating company,\nwhich provide the VIE with exposure to the\ncompany. Although the VIE has no equity\nownership of the Chinese operating company,\nthe contractual arrangements permit the VIE to\nconsolidate the Chinese operating company into\nits financial statements. Intervention by the\nChinese government with respect to VIEs could\nsignificantly affect the Chinese operating\ncompany\u2019s performance and the enforceability\nof the VIE\u2019s contractual arrangements with the\nChinese company. In addition, there is less\nregulation and monitoring of Chinese\nsecurities markets and the activities of\ninvestors, brokers and other participants than\nin the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities\nin China, including Chinese companies that are\nlisted on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulation as are U.S.\nissuers with respect to such matters as\ninsider trading rules, tender offer\nregulation, accounting standards or auditor\noversight, stockholder proxy requirements and\nthe requirements mandating timely and accurate\ndisclosure of information. Securities markets\nin China are in the process of change and\nfurther development. This may lead to trading\nvolatility, difficulty in the settlement and\nrecording of transactions and difficulty in\ninterpreting and applying the relevant\nregulation. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Funds are not\nactively managed and do not select investments\nbased on investor protection considerations.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced past\nperiods of rapid growth, there is no assurance\nthat such growth rates will recur. China may\nexperience substantial rates of inflation,\nsignificant indebtedness or economic\nrecessions, causing a negative effect on the\neconomy and securities market. China\u2019s economy\nis heavily dependent on export growth.\nReduction in spending on Chinese products and\nservices, supply chain diversification,\ninstitution of additional tariffs, sanctions\nor other trade barriers (including as a result\nof heightened trade tensions between China and\nthe U.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China\u2019s key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy and the companies in which a\nFund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which\nmay change from time to time) are directly or\nindirectly subject to economic or trade\nrestrictions imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nFor example, certain foreign technology\ncompanies are subject to U.S. export controls\nas those companies are believed to pose a risk\nto U.S. interests. The U.S. also bans imports\nof goods produced in certain regions of China\nor by certain Chinese companies due to\nconcerns about forced labor. Such restrictions\nmay have unanticipated and adverse effects on\nthe Chinese economy and companies. Any action\nthat targets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. The Underlying Index of a\nFund may include companies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions (but not\ninvestment restrictions) imposed by the U.S.\nor other governments. So long as these\nrestrictions do not include restrictions on\ninvestments, the Fund is generally expected to\ninvest in such companies, consistent with its\nobjective to track the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. The tax laws and regulations\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d )\nare subject to change, including the issuance\nof authoritative guidance or enforcement,\npossibly with retroactive effect. The\ninterpretation, applicability and enforcement\nof such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as\nconsistent and transparent as those of more\ndeveloped nations, and may vary over time and\nfrom region to region. The application and\nenforcement of PRC tax rules could have a\nsignificant adverse effect\n\n20\n\non a Fund and its investors, particularly in\nrelation to capital gains withholding tax\nimposed upon non-residents. In addition, the\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards and practices applicable to Chinese\ncompanies may be less rigorous, and may result\nin significant differences between financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with the PRC\naccounting standards and practice and those\nprepared in accordance with international\naccounting standards. Risk of Investing in the\nChinese Equity Markets. Certain Funds may\ninvest in H-shares (securities of companies\nincorporated in the PRC that are denominated\nin Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong ( \u201c SEHK \u201d )), A-shares\n(securities of companies incorporated in the\nPRC that are denominated in renminbi and\nlisted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange ( \u201c SSE\n\u201d ) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange ( \u201c SZSE \u201d\n)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies\nincorporated in the PRC that are denominated\nin U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or\nHong Kong dollars (in the case of the SZSE)\nand listed on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain\nFunds may also invest in certain Hong Kong-\nlisted securities known as Red-Chips\n(securities issued by companies that are\nincorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions\nand that are controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by entities owned by the national\ngovernment or local governments in the PRC and\nderive substantial revenues from or allocate\nsubstantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips\n(securities issued by companies that are\nincorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions\nand that are controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by individuals in the PRC and\nderive substantial revenues from or allocate\nsubstantial assets in the PRC). Securities\nlisted on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into\ntwo classes: A-shares, which are mostly\nlimited to domestic investors, and B-shares,\nwhich are allocated for both international and\ndomestic investors. The A-shares market is\ngenerally subject to greater government\nrestrictions, including trading suspensions,\nwhich may lead to increased liquidity risks.\nThe B-shares market is generally smaller and\nless liquid and has a smaller issuer base than\nthe A-shares market, which may lead to\nsignificant price volatility. B-shares,\nH-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that\nalso issue A-shares may trade at significant\ndiscounts to their A-shares counterparts. The\nissuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese\ncompanies and the ability to obtain a \u201c back-\ndoor listing \u201d through Red-Chips or P-Chips is\nstill regarded by the Chinese authorities as\nan experiment in economic reform. \u201c Back-door\nlisting \u201d is a means by which a mainland\nChinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to\nobtain quick access to international listing\nand international capital. These share\nmechanisms are subject to the political and\neconomic policies in China. Market\ndevelopments, adverse investor perceptions,\nregulatory and government intervention\n(including the possibility of widespread\ntrading suspensions implemented by regulators)\nand other factors may make it difficult to\nacquire, dispose of or value Chinese\nsecurities, which would lead to adverse\neffects to a Fund. Risk of Investing in\nA-shares through Stock Connect. The iShares\nCore MSCI Total International Stock ETF,\niShares Exponential Technologies ETF, iShares\nGlobal Equity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI\nETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares\nMSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI\nAll Country Asia ex Japan ETF and iShares MSCI\nChina A ETF may invest in A-shares through the\nShanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program ( \u201c\nShanghai Connect \u201d ) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong\nStock Connect program ( \u201c Shenzhen Connect, \u201d\nand together with Shanghai Connect, \u201c Stock\nConnect \u201d ). Stock Connect is a securities\ntrading and clearing program with an aim to\nachieve mutual stock market access between the\nPRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed\nby Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\nthe SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or\nthe SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect),\nand China Securities Depository and Clearing\nCorporation Limited ( \u201c CSDCC \u201d ). Under Stock\nConnect, a Fund\u2019s trading of eligible A-shares\nlisted on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable,\nwould be effectuated through its Hong Kong\nbrokers. Investing in A-shares through Stock\nConnect is subject to trading, clearance,\nsettlement and other procedures, which could\npose risks to a Fund. Although no individual\ninvestment quotas or licensing requirements\napply to investors in Stock Connect, trading\nthrough Stock Connect is subject to a daily\nquota (the \u201c Daily Quota \u201d ), which limits the\nmaximum net purchases under Stock Connect each\nday. The Daily Quota does not belong to a Fund\nand is utilized on a first-come-first-serve\nbasis. As such, buy orders for A-shares would\nbe rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded\n(although a Fund will be permitted to sell\nA-shares regardless of the Daily Quota\nbalance). The Daily Quota may restrict a\nFund\u2019s ability to invest in A-shares through\nStock Connect on a timely basis, which could\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to effectively\npursue its investment strategy. The Daily\nQuota is also subject to change. A-shares\npurchased through Stock Connect generally may\nonly be sold or otherwise transferred through\nStock Connect and in accordance with\napplicable rules. In order to comply with\napplicable local market rules and to\nfacilitate orderly operations of a Fund,\nincluding the timely settlement of Stock\nConnect trades placed by or on behalf of the\nFund, BFA utilizes an operating model that\nwill only be used by iShares ETFs with\ninvestments in A-shares through Stock Connect.\nSuch operating\n\n21\n\nmodel may reduce the risks of trade failures;\nhowever, it will also allow Stock Connect\ntrades to be settled without prior\nverification by a Fund. Accordingly, this\noperating model may subject a Fund to\nadditional risks, including an increased risk\nof inadvertently exceeding certain trade or\nother restrictions or limits placed on the\nFund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened\nrisk of erroneous trades, which may negatively\nimpact the Fund. While A-shares must be\ndesignated as eligible to be traded through\nStock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed\non the SSE, the \u201c SSE Securities, \u201d and such\neligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the \u201c\nSZSE Securities \u201d ), those A-shares may also\nlose such designation, and if this occurs,\nsuch A-shares may be sold but could no longer\nbe purchased through Stock Connect. With\nrespect to sell orders under Stock Connect,\nthe SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to\nensure an investor has sufficient A-shares in\nits account before the market opens on the\ntrading day. Accordingly, if there are\ninsufficient A-shares in an investor\u2019s account\nbefore the market opens on the trading day,\nthe sell order will be rejected, which may\nadversely impact a Fund\u2019s performance. In\naddition, Stock Connect operates only on days\nwhen both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets\nare open for trading and when banking services\nare available in both markets on the\ncorresponding settlement days. Therefore, an\ninvestment in A-shares through Stock Connect\nmay subject a Fund to the risk of price\nfluctuations on days when the Chinese markets\nare open, but Stock Connect is not trading.\nEach of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the\nright to suspend trading under Stock Connect\nunder certain circumstances. Where such a\nsuspension of trading is effected, a Fund\u2019s\nability to access A-shares through Stock\nConnect will be adversely affected. In\naddition, if one or both of the Chinese and\nHong Kong markets are closed on a U.S. trading\nday, a Fund may not be able to acquire or\ndispose of A-shares through Stock Connect in a\ntimely manner, which could adversely affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. A Fund\u2019s investments\nin A-shares though Stock Connect are held by\nits custodian in accounts in the Central\nClearing and Settlement System ( \u201c CCASS \u201d )\nmaintained by the Hong Kong Securities\nClearing Company Limited ( \u201c HKSCC \u201d ), which\nin turn holds the A-shares, as the nominee\nholder, through an omnibus securities account\nin its name registered with the CSDCC. The\nprecise nature and rights of a Fund as the\nbeneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE\nSecurities through HKSCC as nominee is not\nwell defined under PRC law. There is a lack of\na clear definition of, and distinction\nbetween, legal ownership and beneficial\nownership under PRC law, and there have been\nfew cases involving a nominee account\nstructure in the PRC courts. The exact nature\nand methods of enforcement of the rights and\ninterests of a Fund under PRC law are also\nuncertain. In the unlikely event that HKSCC\nbecomes subject to winding-up proceedings in\nHong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE\nSecurities or SZSE Securities may not be\nregarded as held for the beneficial ownership\nof a Fund or as part of the general assets of\nHKSCC available for general distribution to\nits creditors. Notwithstanding the fact that\nHKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in\nthe SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in\nits omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the\nCSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-\nlisted companies will still treat HKSCC as one\nof the shareholders when it handles corporate\nactions in respect of such SSE Securities or\nSZSE Securities. HKSCC monitors the corporate\nactions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE\nSecurities and keeps participants of CCASS\ninformed of all such corporate actions that\nrequire CCASS participants to take steps in\norder to participate in them. A Fund will\ntherefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement\nand notification and implementation of\ncorporate actions. The HKSCC is responsible\nfor the clearing, settlement and provision of\ndepositary, nominee and other related services\nof the trades executed by Hong Kong market\nparticipants and investors. Accordingly,\ninvestors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE\nSecurities directly; rather, they are held\nthrough their brokers\u2019 or custodians\u2019 accounts\nwith CCASS. The HKSCC and the CSDCC establish\nclearing links and each has become a\nparticipant of the other to facilitate\nclearing and settlement of cross-border\ntrades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be\ndeclared as a defaulter, HKSCC\u2019s liabilities\nin Stock Connect under its market contracts\nwith clearing participants will be limited to\nassisting clearing participants in pursuing\ntheir claims against the CSDCC. In that event,\na Fund may suffer delays in the recovery\nprocess or may not be able to fully recover\nits losses from the CSDCC. Market participants\nare able to participate in Stock Connect\nsubject to meeting certain information\ntechnology capability, risk management and\nother requirements as may be specified by the\nrelevant exchange and/or clearing house.\nFurther, the \u201c connectivity \u201d in Stock Connect\nrequires the routing of orders across the\nborders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This\nrequires the development of new information\ntechnology systems on the part of the SEHK and\nexchange participants. There is no assurance\nthat these systems will function properly or\nwill continue to be adapted to changes and\ndevelopments in both markets. In the event\nthat the relevant systems fail to function\nproperly, trading in A-shares through Stock\nConnect could be disrupted, and a Fund\u2019s\nability to achieve its investment objective\nmay be adversely affected.\n\n22\n\nThe Shanghai Connect program, launched in\nNovember 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect\nprogram, launched in December 2016, do not\nhave an extensive operating history. Stock\nConnect is subject to regulations promulgated\nby regulatory authorities and implementation\nrules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC\nand Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to how\nthe current regulations will be applied or\ninterpreted going forward, and new or revised\nregulations may be issued from time to time by\nthe regulators and stock exchanges in China\nand Hong Kong in connection with operations,\nlegal enforcement and cross-border trades\nunder Stock Connect. In addition, there can be\nno assurance that Stock Connect will not be\ndiscontinued. A Fund may be adversely affected\nas a result of such changes. Furthermore, the\nsecurities regimes and legal systems of China\nand Hong Kong differ significantly and issues\nmay arise based on these differences. Further,\ndifferent fees, costs and taxes are imposed on\nforeign investors acquiring A-shares through\nStock Connect, and these fees, costs and taxes\nmay be higher than comparable fees, costs and\ntaxes imposed on owners of other Chinese\nsecurities providing similar investment\nexposure. A-Share Market Suspension Risk.\nA-shares may only be bought from, or sold to,\na Fund at times when the relevant A-shares may\nbe sold or purchased on the relevant Chinese\nstock exchange. The A-shares market can have a\nhigher propensity for trading suspensions than\nmany other global equity markets. Trading\nsuspensions in certain stocks could lead to\ngreater market execution risk, valuation\nrisks, and liquidity risks and costs for a\nFund, as well as for Authorized Participants\nthat create and redeem Creation Units of the\nFund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily\nlimit, set at 10%, of the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in the prices of\nA-shares during a single trading day. The\ndaily limit refers to price movements only and\ndoes not restrict trading within the relevant\nlimit. There can be no assurance that a liquid\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular A-share or for any particular time.\nThis could increase a Fund\u2019s tracking error\nand/or cause a Fund to trade in the market at\ngreater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Given that the\nA-share market is considered volatile and\nunstable (with the risk of widespread trading\nsuspensions or government intervention), the\ncreation and redemption of Creation Units may\nalso be disrupted. Risk of Investing in\nDeveloped Countries. Many countries with\ndeveloped markets have recently experienced\nsignificant economic pressures. These\ncountries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket countries may be subject to greater\nrisks than investments in developed countries.\nThese risks include: (i) less social,\npolitical, and economic stability; (ii)\ngreater illiquidity and price volatility due\nto smaller or limited local capital markets\nfor such securities, or low or non-existent\ntrading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians,\nclearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-\ndealers may be subject to less scrutiny and\nregulation by local authorities; (iv) local\ngovernments may decide to seize or confiscate\nsecurities held by foreign investors and/or\nlocal governments may decide to suspend or\nlimit an issuer's ability to make dividend or\ninterest payments; (v) local\n\n23\n\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Funds\nare not actively managed and do not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect a Fund's ability to\naccurately value its portfolio securities or\nto acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\na Fund's investment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nFund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. A Fund's income\nand, in some cases, capital gains from foreign\nsecurities will be subject to applicable\ntaxation in certain of the emerging market\ncountries in which it invests, and treaties\nbetween the U.S. and such countries may not be\navailable in some cases to reduce the\notherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions.\n\n24\n\nIn the past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries may expose a Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries. A\nFund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ). A number of countries within the EU are\nalso members of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the\neuro as their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone. Consequently, these countries must\ncomply with many of the restrictions noted\nabove. The European financial markets have\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns,\ngovernment debt levels and the possible\ndefault of government debt in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nIn order to prevent further economic\ndeterioration, certain countries, without\nprior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments.\n\n25\n\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich a Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Japan. Japan may be subject to\npolitical, economic, labor and other risks.\nAny of these risks, individually or in the\naggregate, can impact an investment made in\nJapan. Currency Risk . The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times and any increase in\nits value may cause a decline in exports that\ncould weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Economic Risk\n. The growth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy. Geographic Risk . Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy, and,\nin turn, could negatively affect a Fund. Labor\nRisk . Japan has an aging workforce and has\nexperienced a significant population decline\nin recent years. Japan\u2019s labor market appears\nto be undergoing fundamental structural\nchanges, as a labor market traditionally\naccustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to\nmeet the need for increased labor mobility,\nwhich may adversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan\u2019s\npolitical relationship with China, however,\nhas been strained. Should political tension\nincrease, it could adversely affect the\nJapanese economy and destabilize the region as\na whole. Security Risk. Japan's relations with\nits neighbors, particularly China, North\nKorea, South Korea and Russia, have at times\nbeen strained due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities and defense concerns.\nMost recently, the Japanese government has\nshown concern over the increased nuclear and\nmilitary activity by North Korea and China.\nStrained relations may cause uncertainty in\nthe Japanese markets and adversely affect the\noverall Japanese economy, particularly in\ntimes of crisis. Risk of Investing in the\nMiddle East. Many Middle Eastern countries\nhave little or no democratic tradition, and\nthe political and legal systems in such\ncountries may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. Many economies in the Middle East are\nhighly reliant on income from the sale of oil\nand natural gas or trade with countries\ninvolved in the sale of oil and natural gas,\nand their economies are therefore vulnerable\nto changes in the market for oil and natural\ngas and foreign currency values. As global\ndemand for oil and natural gas fluctuates,\nmany Middle Eastern economies may be\nsignificantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\n\n26\n\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and a Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in a Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. For example, the potential liability of\na shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. Each Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as a\nFund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of a Fund. For example, in certain\nof these countries, a Fund may be required to\ninvest initially through a local broker or\nother entity and then have the shares that\nwere purchased re-registered in the name of a\nFund. Re-registration in some instances may\nnot be possible on a timely basis. This may\nresult in a delay during which a Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where a Fund places a\npurchase order but is subsequently informed,\nat the time of re-registration, that the\npermissible allocation of the investment to\nforeign investors has already been filled and,\nconsequently, a Fund may not be able to invest\nin the relevant company. Substantial\nlimitations may exist in certain Middle\nEastern countries with respect to a Fund\u2019s\nability to repatriate investment income or\ncapital gains. A Fund could be adversely\naffected by delays in, or a refusal to grant,\nany required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to a Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which a Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which a Fund invests.\n\n27\n\nThe U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest\ntrading and investment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are significantly\naffected by developments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total\nmerchandise trade among the three countries\nhas increased. However, political developments\nincluding the implementation of tariffs by the\nU.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the\nform of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North\nAmerica\u2019s economic outlook and, as a result,\nthe value of securities held by a Fund. Policy\nand legislative changes in one country may\nhave a significant effect on North American\nmarkets generally, as well as on the value of\ncertain securities held by a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in Russia. Investing in the Russian\nsecurities market involves a high degree of\nrisk and special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities market, and should be considered\nhighly speculative. Risks include: the absence\nof developed legal structures governing\nprivate and foreign investments and private\nproperty; the possibility of the loss of all\nor a substantial portion of a Fund\u2019s assets\ninvested in Russia as a result of\nexpropriation; certain national policies which\nmay restrict the Fund\u2019s investment\nopportunities, including, without limitation,\nrestrictions on investing in issuers or\nindustries deemed sensitive to relevant\nnational interests; and potentially greater\nprice volatility in, significantly smaller\ncapitalization of, and relative illiquidity\nof, the Russian market. There can also be no\nassurance that a Fund\u2019s investments in the\nRussian securities market would not be\nexpropriated, nationalized or otherwise\nconfiscated. In the event of the settlement of\nany such claims or such expropriation,\nnationalization or other confiscation, a Fund\ncould lose its entire investment. In addition,\nit may be difficult and more costly to obtain\nand enforce a judgment in the Russian court\nsystem. Russia may also be subject to a\ngreater degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability than is the case in other\ndeveloped countries. Such instability may\nresult from, among other things, the\nfollowing: (i) an authoritarian government or\nmilitary involvement in political and economic\ndecision-making, including changes in\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means;\n(ii) popular unrest associated with demands\nfor improved political, economic and social\nconditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv)\nhostile relations, including armed conflict,\nwith neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic,\nreligious and racial disaffection. The Russian\neconomy is heavily dependent upon the export\nof a range of commodities including most\nindustrial metals, forestry products and oil\nand gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected\nby international commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. As Russia produces and\nexports large amounts of crude oil and gas,\nany acts of terrorism or armed conflict\ncausing disruptions of Russian oil and gas\nexports could negatively affect the Russian\neconomy and, thus, adversely affect the\nfinancial condition, results of operations or\nprospects of related companies. Current and\nfuture economic sanctions may also adversely\naffect the Russian oil, banking, mining,\nmetals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among\nother sectors. The Russian government may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in Russia, which could\nhave a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in Russia. In recent years,\nthe Russian government has begun to take\nbolder steps to re-assert its regional\ngeopolitical influence (including military\nsteps) and launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. Additionally,\nRussia is alleged to have participated in\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Such steps\nhave increased tensions between Russia and its\nneighbors and Western countries and may\nnegatively affect economic growth. Actual and\nthreatened responses by other nation-states to\nRussia\u2019s alleged cyber activity may have an\nadverse impact on the Russian economy and the\nRussian issuers of securities in which a Fund\ninvests. For example, the U.S. has added\ncertain foreign technology companies to the\nU.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Russian economy.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian\n\n28\n\nindividuals, including politicians, may impact\nRussia\u2019s economy, Russian issuers of\nsecurities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions . Governments in\nthe U.S. and many other countries\n(collectively, the \u201c Sanctioning Bodies \u201d )\nhave imposed economic sanctions on certain\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nand Russian corporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from global payments\nsystems that facilitate cross-border payments.\nThe Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or\ndeliver those securities and/or assets.\nRecently, Russia has issued a number of\ncountersanctions, some of which restrict the\ndistribution of profits by limited liability\ncompanies ( e.g. , dividends), and prohibits\nRussian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. The sanctions\nagainst certain Russian issuers include\nprohibitions on transacting in or dealing in\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers.\nCompliance with each of these sanctions has\nand may continue to impair the ability of a\nFund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver\nthe affected securities or other securities of\nsuch issuers. If it becomes impracticable or\nunlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject\nto, or otherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may\nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected\nsecurities in connection with creation\ntransactions and instead require a cash\ndeposit, which may also increase a Fund\u2019s\ntransaction costs. A Fund may also be legally\nrequired to freeze assets in a blocked\naccount. Sanctions have resulted in Russia\ntaking counter measures or retaliatory\nactions, which has impaired the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nretaliatory measures include the immediate\nfreeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due\nto such a freeze of these assets, including\ndepositary receipts, a Fund may need to\nliquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in a Fund receiving\nsubstantially lower prices for its securities.\nRussia may implement additional retaliatory\nmeasures, which may further impair the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities and the\nability of the Fund to receive dividend\npayments. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russian companies\nmay be unable to pay dividends and, if they\npay dividends, the Fund may be unable to\nreceive them. These sanctions, the decision by\nRussia to suspend trading on the Moscow\nExchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident\ninvestors from executing security sales, and\nother events have led to changes in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\u2019s Index Provider\nhas removed Russian securities from the\nUnderlying Index. To the extent that the Fund\nrebalances its portfolio and trades in non-\nRussian securities to seek to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index,\nthis may result in transaction costs and\nincreased tracking error. The Fund is\ncurrently restricted from trading in Russian\nsecurities, including those in its portfolio,\nwhile the Underlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. This disparity will also lead to\nincreased tracking error. The inability of the\nFund to trade in Russian securities may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to meet\nits investment objective. It is unknown when,\nor if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u2019s\nability to trade in Russian securities will\nresume. Also, if an affected security is\nincluded in a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index, a Fund\nmay, where practicable, seek to eliminate its\nholdings of the affected security by employing\nor augmenting its representative sampling\nstrategy to seek to track the investment\nresults of its Underlying Index. The use of\n(or increased use of) a representative\nsampling strategy may increase a Fund\u2019s\ntracking error risk. If the affected\nsecurities constitute a significant percentage\nof the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be\nable to effectively implement a representative\nsampling strategy, which may result in\nsignificant tracking error between a Fund\u2019s\nperformance and the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. Risk of Investing in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors (such\nas the Funds) to invest in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such\nability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign\n\n29\n\ninvestors, including a limitation on a Fund\u2019s\nownership of the securities of any single\nissuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock\nExchange, which may prevent a Fund from\ninvesting in accordance with its strategy and\ncontribute to tracking error against the\nUnderlying Index. These restrictions may be\nchanged or new restrictions, such as licensing\nrequirements, special approvals or additional\nforeign taxes, may be instituted at any time.\nA Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain\nany such licenses or approvals and may not be\nable to buy and sell securities at full value.\nMajor disruptions or regulatory changes could\noccur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of\nwhich could negatively impact a Fund. These\nrisks may be exacerbated, compared to more\ndeveloped markets, given the limited history\nof foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also\nbe subject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand a Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental actions\nin the future could have a significant effect\non economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which\ncould affect private sector companies and a\nFund, as well as the value of securities in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on\nSaudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian\ncorporate entities, or even the threat of\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Saudi Arabian\nsecurities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or\nother adverse consequences to the Saudi\nArabian economy. Any sanctions could also\nresult in the immediate freeze of Saudi\nArabian securities and/or funds investing in\nprohibited assets, impairing the ability of a\nFund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those\nsecurities and/or assets. In addition, Saudi\nArabia\u2019s economy relies heavily on cheap,\nforeign labor, and changes in the availability\nof this labor supply could have an adverse\neffect on the economy. The securities markets\nin Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as\nthose in other countries. As a result,\nsecurities markets in Saudi Arabia are subject\nto greater risks associated with market\nvolatility, lower market capitalization, lower\ntrading volume, illiquidity, inflation,\ngreater price fluctuations, uncertainty\nregarding the existence of trading markets,\ngovernmental control and heavy regulation of\nlabor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi\nArabian companies tend to trade less\nfrequently than those of companies on\nexchanges in more developed markets. Such\ninfrequent trading may adversely affect the\npricing of these securities and a Fund\u2019s\nability to sell these securities in the\nfuture. Although the political situation in\nSaudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia\nhas historically experienced political\ninstability, and there remains the possibility\nthat the stability will not hold in the future\nor that instability in the larger Middle East\nregion could adversely impact the economy of\nSaudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by\nmilitary developments, government\ninterventions in the marketplace, terrorism,\nextremist attitudes, attempted social or\npolitical reforms, religious differences, or\nother factors. Additionally, anti-Western\nviews held by certain groups in the Middle\nEast may influence government policies\nregarding foreign investment. Further\ndevelopments in U.S. relations with Saudi\nArabia and other Middle-Eastern countries may\naffect these attitudes and policies. The U.S.\nis a significant trading partner of, or\nforeign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a\nresult, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia\nmay be particularly affected by changes in the\nU.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult,\n\n30\n\nsecurities to which a Fund has exposure.\nPolitical instability in North Africa and the\nlarger Middle East region has caused\nsignificant disruptions to many industries.\nContinued political and social unrest in these\nareas may negatively affect the value of\nsecurities in a Fund\u2019s portfolio. Certain\nissuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate\nin, or have dealings with, countries subject\nto sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the\nU.S. government and the United Nations and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. A\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the Automotive Sub-Industry. The\nautomotive sub-industry can be highly\ncyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-\nindustry may suffer periodic losses. The\nautomotive sub-industry is also highly\ncompetitive and there may be, at times, excess\ncapacity in the global and domestic automotive\nsub-industry. Over the last several decades,\nthe U.S. automotive sub-industry has\nexperienced periodic downturns; certain\nautomotive companies required stimulus from\nthe U.S. government, while others formed\nstrategic industry alliances in order to\nweather the substantially difficult market\nconditions. In general, the automotive sub-\nindustry is susceptible to labor disputes,\nproduct defect litigation, patent expiration,\nincreased pension liabilities, rise in\nmaterial or component prices and changing\nconsumer tastes. Risk of Investing in the\nBasic Materials Industry. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry could be adversely affected\nby commodity price volatility, inflation,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Communication\nServices Sector. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory\n\n31\n\noversight, among other factors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within the sector,\nwhich could lead to further regulation or\nother negative effects in the future.\nTelecommunication providers investing in\nnon-U.S. countries may be subject to similar\nrisks. Additional risks include those related\nto competitive challenges in the U.S. from\nnon-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic\njoint ventures with U.S. companies and in\nnon-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nCyclical Industry. A Fund may invest in\nconsumer cyclical companies, which rely\nheavily on business cycles and economic\nconditions. Consumer cyclical companies\ninclude automotive manufacturers, retail\ncompanies, and housing-related companies. The\nconsumer cyclical industry can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer tastes and\ntrends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and\nsports arenas, camping and recreational\nequipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-\nrelated services, automobiles, hotels and\nmotels, and fast food and other restaurants)\nare subject to the risk that their products or\nservices may become obsolete quickly. The\nsuccess of these companies can depend heavily\non disposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in a\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund\ncould lose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the\n\n32\n\nregulatory environment, taxation policies, the\nenactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war\nor other geopolitical conflicts, and the\neconomies of key energy-consuming countries.\nCompanies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by terrorism, cyber\nincidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of a Fund. Risk of Investing in\nthe Financials Sector. Companies in the\nfinancials sector include small, regional and\nmoney center banks, securities brokerage\nfirms, asset management companies, savings\nbanks and thrift institutions, specialty\nfinance companies ( e.g. , credit card,\nmortgage providers), insurance and insurance\nbrokerage firms, consumer finance firms,\nfinancial conglomerates and foreign banking\nand financial companies. Most financial\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which a Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding market share and price competition.\nFinancial companies in foreign countries are\nsubject to market-specific and general\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers.\n\n33\n\nIn addition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities.\n\n34\n\nRisk of Investing in the Industrials Sector.\nThe value of securities issued by companies in\nthe industrials sector may be adversely\naffected by supply of and demand for both\ntheir specific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Information\nTechnology Sector. Information technology\ncompanies face intense competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, which may\nhave an adverse effect on profit margins. Like\nother technology companies, information\ntechnology companies may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of information\ntechnology companies may face product\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction, unpredictable changes in growth\nrates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Companies in the information\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Information technology companies\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. Finally,\nwhile all companies may be susceptible to\nnetwork security breaches, certain companies\nin the information technology sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThese risks are heightened for information\ntechnology companies in foreign markets. Risk\nof Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which a Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the\nProducer Durables Industry. The producer\ndurables industry includes companies involved\nin the design, manufacture or distribution of\nindustrial durables such as electrical\nequipment and components, industrial products,\nand housing and telecommunications equipment.\nThese companies may be affected by changes in\ndomestic and international economies and\npolitics, consolidation, and excess capacity.\nCompanies in the producer durables industry\nface intense competition, which may have an\nadverse effect on their profitability. The\nsuccess of companies in the producer durables\nindustry may be strongly affected by changes\nin consumer demands, spending, tastes and\npreferences. Companies in the producer\ndurables industry may be dependent on outside\nfinancing, which may be difficult to obtain.\nProducer durables companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. In addition, these\ncompanies may be significantly affected by\nother factors such as economic cycles, rapid\ntechnical obsolescence, government\nregulations, labor relations, delays in\nmodernization, overall capital spending levels\nand product liability lawsuits. Risk of\nInvesting in the Real Estate Industry.\nCompanies in the real estate industry include\ncompanies that invest in real estate, such as\nREITs, real estate holding and operating\ncompanies or real estate development companies\n(collectively, \u201c Real Estate Companies \u201d ).\nInvesting in Real Estate Companies exposes\ninvestors to the risks of owning real estate\ndirectly, as well as to risks that relate\nspecifically to the way in which Real Estate\nCompanies are organized and operated. The real\nestate industry is highly sensitive to general\nand local economic conditions and\ndevelopments, and characterized by intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding.\nInvesting in Real Estate Companies involves\nvarious risks. Some risks that are specific to\nReal Estate Companies are discussed in greater\ndetail below. Concentration Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype. Economic downturns affecting a\nparticular region, industry or property type\nmay lead to a high volume of defaults within a\nshort period.\n\n35\n\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated\n\n36\n\nwith commercial property, including the tie\nbetween income available to service debt and\nproductive use of the property. Real Estate\nCompanies may also invest in debt instruments\nand preferred equity that are junior in an\nissuer\u2019s capital structure and that involve\nprivately negotiated structures. Subordinated\ndebt investments, such as B-Notes and\nmezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk\nof default due to the need to service more\nsenior debt of the issuer. Similarly,\npreferred equity investments involve a greater\nrisk of loss than conventional debt financing\ndue to their non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nRisk of Investing in the Technology Sector.\nTechnology companies are characterized by\nperiodic new product introductions,\ninnovations and evolving industry standards,\nand, as a result, face intense competition,\nboth domestically and internationally, which\nmay have an adverse effect on profit margins.\nCompanies in the technology sector are often\nsmaller and less experienced companies and may\nbe subject to greater risks than larger\ncompanies; these risks may be heightened for\ntechnology companies in foreign markets.\nTechnology companies may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of technology\ncompanies may face product obsolescence due to\nrapid technological developments and frequent\nnew product introduction, changes in consumer\nand business purchasing patterns,\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. In addition, a rising interest rate\nenvironment tends to negatively affect\ncompanies in the technology sector because, in\nsuch an environment, those companies with high\nmarket valuations may appear less attractive\nto investors, which may cause sharp decreases\nin the companies\u2019 market prices. Companies in\nthe technology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Companies in the technology sector\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. The\ntechnology sector may also be adversely\naffected by changes or trends in commodity\nprices, which may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the technology sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nRisk of Investing in the Telecommunications\nSector. The telecommunications sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the Utilities\nSector. The utilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changing commodity prices,\ngovernment regulation stipulating rates\ncharged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear generating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\n\n37\n\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: A Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of a Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to a Fund to settle\npurchases of a Fund ( i.e. Deposit Securities)\nor that Authorized Participants would receive\nfrom a Fund to settle redemptions of a Fund (\ni.e. Fund Securities). These files are known\nas the Portfolio Composition File and the Fund\nData File (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The\nFiles are applicable for the next trading day\nand are provided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption.\n\n38\n\nBFA employees may also discuss portfolio\nholdings-related information with\nbroker/dealers, in connection with settling a\nFund\u2019s transactions, as may be necessary to\nconduct business in the ordinary course in a\nmanner consistent with the disclosure in the\nFund's current registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nMorningstar Indices Morningstar \u00ae Exponential\nTechnologies Index SM Component Selection\nCriteria. Managers from Morningstar\u2019s Global\nEquity Research team identify technology\nthemes with potential to have significant\neconomic benefits to producers and users. As\nof October 12, 2023, nine exponential\ntechnology themes have been identified:\n\n39\n\n\u2022 Big Data and Analytics: Capabilities with\ndata sets too large and complex to manipulate\nor interrogate with standard methods or tools.\nRelated subthemes include Artificial\nIntelligence & Machine Learning and\nBioinformatics. \u2022 Cloud Computing: A paradigm\nshift from the legacy IT model whereby each\nelement is accessed in a scalable, on- demand\nmanner through the internet. Relative\nsubthemes include Infrastructure as a Service\n(IaaS) & Platform as a Service (PaaS) as well\nas Software as a Service (SaaS). \u2022 Energy\nTransition: The quest to abate global climate\nchange and reduce greenhouse gases has led to\na surge of new energy technologies,\ninvestment, and innovation. Related subthemes\ninclude Carbon Capture Technologies, Energy\nStorage, Hydrogen, and Renewable Energy. \u2022\nFintech Innovation: The search for and\nacknowledgement of nontraditional emerging\nfunding sources, platforms, currency, and\nstored and transferred value. In some cases,\ntraditional financial services companies are\nexpanding their offerings with innovative,\ntechnology-enabled services to meet consumer\npreferences. On other cases, companies are\nbuilding new platforms that could potentially\ntransform the industry. \u2022 Healthcare\nInnovation: Key advancements in unlocking the\nhuman genome have opened doors to paradigm\nshifts that will radically change the way we\ntreat or prevent diseases. Related subthemes\ninclude Innovated Devices & Diagnostics and\nInnovative Therapies. \u2022 Hyperconnectivity:\nThis theme will fuel rapid growth in connected\ndevices and a voracious need to push more data\nat faster transmission rates between users and\ndevices. Related subthemes include 5G\nConnectivity, Cybersecurity, Internet of\nThings (IoT), and Non-Cellular Connectivity. \u2022\nNanotechnology: The branch of technology that\ndeals with dimensions and tolerances of less\nthan 100 nanometers, especially the\nmanipulation of individual atoms and\nmolecules. \u2022 Next Gen Transportation:\nTechnologies replacing traditional human-\noperated, internal combustion engine-based\nvehicles. This includes a wide variety of\napplications like traditional light vehicles,\npublic transportation vehicles,\nscooters/bikes, and drones, to name just a\nfew. Related subthemes include Autonomous\nDriving Technologies and Electric Vehicles. \u2022\nRobotics: The branch of technology that deals\nwith the design, construction, operation, and\napplication of robots. Analysts project\nwhether exposure to the theme will drive a\nmaterial net profit increase and then project\nthe percentage revenue in five years the\ncompany will derive from exposure to the\ntheme. For companies classified as \u201c\nproducers, \u201d those projected to derive more\nthan 50% revenue are assigned a score of \u201c 4.\n\u201d For companies classified as \u201c suppliers, \u201d\nthose projected to derive more than 50%\nrevenue are assigned a score of \u201c 3. \u201d For\ncompanies classified as \u201c producers or\nsuppliers, \u201d those projected to derive between\n25 and 50% revenue are assigned a score of \u201c\n2, \u201d and those companies projected to derive\nbetween 10 and 25% revenue are assigned a\nscore of \u201c 1. \u201d For companies classified as \u201c\ndownstream users \u201d and all others that are\nprojected to derive less than 10% revenue are\nassigned a score of \u201c 0. \u201d Scores are then\ncalibrated across individual analysts,\nsectors, and themes. The eligible universe of\nsecurities in the Underlying Index must be in\nMorningstar\u2019s Global Equity Index family and\nscored by Morningstar\u2019s Global Equity Research\nanalysts. Companies with average three month\ntrailing daily trading volume less than $2\nmillion USD or aggregate float market\ncapitalizations of $300 million USD or less\nare disqualified from entering the index.\nCompanies that are current index constituents\nare eliminated if they have average three-\nmonth trading volume less than $1.5 million\nUSD or aggregate float market capitalization\nof $200 million USD or less. Up to the top 10\nscoring companies within each theme are\nidentified as \u201c Theme Leaders \u201d and\nprioritized for inclusion using the ranking\ncriteria below in descending order of\npreference: 1) Highest thematic score 2)\nExisting constituents are given preference;\nand 3) Market capitalization, preferring\nsmaller over larger The same company may meet\nthe leaders selection criteria across multiple\nthemes. This can result in fewer than 90 (10*9\nthemes) securities being selected in this\nstep.\n\n40\n\nAll eligible constituents, excluding the\nconstituents already selected as Theme\nLeaders, are ranked by the criteria below in\ndescending order of (score 4) absolute\npreference: 1) Number of themes in which a\nconstituent scores \u201c 4 \u201d ; 2) Number of themes\nin which a constituent scores \u201c 3 \u201d ; 3)\nNumber of themes in which a constituent scores\n\u201c 2 \u201d ; 4) Number of themes in which a\nconstituent scores \u201c 1 \u201d ; 5) Existing\nconstituents are given preference; and 6)\nMarket capitalization, preferring smaller over\nlarger. From the above ranked list,\nconstituents are then added to the list of\nconstituents included as Theme Leaders until\n200 constituents are included. Issue Changes.\nSecurities are added or deleted from the\nUnderlying Index based on rules outlined for\nsecurity selection, exclusion, rebalancing,\nand adjustments for corporate actions as set\nforth in the Morningstar Index Rulebook.\nMorningstar makes no subjective determinations\nrelated to index composition. Number of\nComponents: approximately 195 Index\nDescription. The Underlying Index measures the\nperformance of equity securities issued by\ncompanies that the Equity Research team of\nMorningstar has determined are positioned to\nexperience meaningful economic benefits as a\nsupplier, user, or producer of promising\ntechnologies. The Index Provider has\nidentified nine exponential technology themes.\nThe Underlying Index is equal weighted. Index\nMaintenance. After selection and weighting of\nthe portfolio, 90% of index weight at the time\nof reconstitution must have a 5-year forward\nnon-overlapping revenue exposure forecast of\nat least 25% ( i.e ., a score of 2 in at least\none theme). The Underlying Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually and\nimplemented after the close of business on the\nthird Friday of December and is effective the\nfollowing Monday. If Monday is a holiday, it\nis effective on the immediately following\nbusiness day. The market data used for\nreconstitution and rebalance is as of the last\ntrading day of November. Index Availability.\nMorningstar Indexes are calculated\ncontinuously and are available from major data\nvendors. Morningstar \u00ae Global Artificial\nIntelligence Select Index SM Number of\nComponents: approximately 48 The Underlying\nIndex is a subset of the Morningstar Global\nMarkets Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which\nrepresents approximately the top 97% of the\nglobal investable equity market\ncapitalization. The eligible universe of\nsecurities in the Underlying Index includes\nthe Parent Index, excluding companies in India\nor the People\u2019s Republic of China and\ncompanies with average three-month trailing\ndaily trading volume less than $2 million and\nfloat market capitalization of less than $300\nmillion. The Index Provider scores companies\nin the eligible universe on a four-point\nthematic exposure scale based on exposure to\nat least one AI subtheme and then assigns each\ncompany to one of three tiers ( i.e ., Tier 1,\nTier 2 or Tier 3). Morningstar considers each\ncompany\u2019s role in the AI subtheme value chain,\nexpected net profit increase from exposure to\nat least one AI subtheme and the portion of\nrevenue expected to be derived from each AI\nsubtheme over the next five years. Companies\nwith a score of 2 or higher on the generative\nAI subtheme are assigned to Tier 1, and the\nrest are classified as either Tier 2 or Tier\n3. All companies with a score of at least 2\nacross any one of the three other AI subthemes\n( i.e ., Al data and infrastructure, Al\nservices, or Al software) are assigned to Tier\n2. Companies with an aggregate score of at\nleast 3 across all four AI subthemes are also\nassigned to Tier 2. All remaining companies\nwith a non-zero score on at least one AI\nsubtheme are assigned to Tier 3. The Index\nProvider then ranks the companies to emphasize\nthematic purity and exposure to the generative\nAI subtheme according to the following ranking\ncriteria (in descending order): \u2022 Tier 1\ncompanies are preferred over Tier 2 companies,\nand Tier 2 companies are preferred over Tier 3\ncompanies. \u2022 Generative AI subtheme score\n(highest to lowest). \u2022 Aggregate score across\nall 4 subthemes (highest to lowest).\n\n41\n\n\u2022 Current index constituents are given\npreference. \u2022 Current total market\ncapitalization, with preference to smaller\nmarket capitalization over larger market\ncapitalization. Morningstar generally includes\nthe top 50 companies in the Underlying Index,\nsubject to adjustments for corporate actions.\nThe Underlying Index is weighted by float-\nadjusted market capitalization; however, the\naggregate weight of Tier 3 securities cannot\nexceed 10%, and the excess weight is\nredistributed proportionally to Tier 1 and\nTier 2 securities. Additionally, the weight of\nany one Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 security,\nrespectively, cannot exceed 6%, 3% and 3%,\nwith the excess weight distributed\nproportionally within each Tier. If the\naggregate weight of securities with a weight\nof at least 4.5% exceeds 22.5%, then\nMorningstar caps the weight of any one\nsecurity at 6% and the sum of securities at\n22.5%, with excess weight redistributed\nproportionally within each Tier. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced quarterly on\nthe third Friday of March, June and September\n(effective the following business day) and\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually\nfollowing the third Friday of December\n(effective the following business day). To\nremain in the Underlying Index, current\nconstituents must have an average three-month\ndaily trading volume of at least $1.6 million\nand a free-float market capitalization of at\nleast $240 million at the annual\nreconstitution. Morningstar \u00ae Global Digital\nInfrastructure & Connectivity Index SM Number\nof Components: approximately 49 Index\nDescription. The Morningstar Global Digital\nInfrastructure & Connectivity Index is a new\nindex provided by Morningstar Indexes ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d ) and is designed to represent\nthe performance of equity securities issued by\ncompanies positioned to experience meaningful\neconomic benefits from providing products,\nservices, and technologies related to cloud\ncomputing and 5G, as determined by Morningstar\nIndexes or its affiliates. Constituents are\nselected by making forward-looking\nassessments, rather than relying on single\npoint-in-time metrics such as percent of\ncurrent revenues, to identify companies that\nare producers of promising digital\ninfrastructure technologies consisting of two\nthemes \u2013 cloud computing, which enables cloud\ncomputing applications through Infrastructure\nas a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service\n(PaaS) solutions, and 5G, which enables next\ngeneration connectivity through fifth\ngeneration broadband cellular networks, as\ndefined by Morningstar\u2019s Equity Research team.\nThe Underlying Index selects the top 25\nsecurities within each theme based on the\nranking criteria to build a portfolio of 50\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is rebalanced\nand reconstituted annually, and float adjusted\nmarket-capitalization weighted. A 2.5% cap on\nthe weight of individual securities is applied\nduring the rebalancing process. Eligibility.\nThe following rules are used for the initial\nconstituent selection and ongoing\nreconstitution: \u2022 Companies with a thematic\nexposure score of 3, 2 or 1 to either theme. \u2022\nCompanies that have: \u2022 float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of $300 million or greater\n(USD). \u2022 3 month ADTV (Average Daily Trading\nValue) of $2 million or greater (USD);\nexisting constituents could remain if 3 month\nADTV is at least $1.5 million (USD).\nMorningstar \u00ae Global Emerging Green\nTechnologies Select Index SM Number of\nComponents: approximately 48 Index\nDescription. The Morningstar Global Emerging\nGreen Technologies Select Index is an equity\nindex designed to reflect the performance of\nequity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompanies, selected from the Morningstar\nGlobal Markets ex-India Index. The Morningstar\nGlobal Markets ex-India Index is composed of\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization\nsecurities from developed and emerging\nmarkets. The Underlying Index is designed to\nreflect the equity performance of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. companies involved in breakthrough\ninnovations and new technologies that seek to\naddress or combat climate change, as\ndetermined by Morningstar or its affiliates (\n\u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ).\nTo construct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider begins with securities from the\nMorningstar Global Markets ex-India Index and\napplies a number of exclusions. The Index\nProvider excludes constituents with an average\nthree-month trailing daily trading volume of\nless than $2 million or a free float market\ncapitalization of less than $300 million.\nCurrent index\n\n42\n\nconstituents are eliminated if they have an\naverage three-month trailing daily trading\nvolume of less than $1.5 million or a free\nfloat market capitalization of less than $200\nmillion. If a company has more than one\neligible share class, the Index Provider will\nselect the one that is a current index\nconstituent. Otherwise, the Index Provider\nwill select the most liquid share class, as\ndetermined by the Index Provider. The Index\nProvider also excludes the securities of\ncompanies that it identifies as being involved\nin the business of tobacco, companies involved\nwith controversial weapons, producers and\nretailers of civilian firearms, and companies\ninvolved in thermal coal mining, thermal coal-\nbased power generation or the extraction of\noil sands. Certain exclusions ( e.g.,\ncontroversial and nuclear weapons or the\nproduction of tobacco products) are\ncategorical, and other exclusions are based on\npercentage of revenue or ownership thresholds\n(as discussed below). Categorical exclusions\ninclude any issuer that has any involvement\nin: \u2022 the sale of assault or non-assault\nweapons; \u2022 the manufacture of small arms\ncomponents; \u2022 the production of tobacco\nproducts; and \u2022 controversial and nuclear\nweapons ( e.g., antipersonnel mines,\nbiological and chemical weapons, depleted\nuranium, nuclear weapons, or white\nphosphorus). Additionally, the Index Provider\ncategorically excludes companies that it\ndetermines are involved in controversies\nrelated to the ten United Nations Global\nCompact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d ) principles, which are\nclassified into four categories: human rights,\nlabor, environment and anti-corruption. The\nIndex Provider relies on the assessment of a\nthird party data provider, Sustainalytics, to\ndetermine whether an issuer has violated the\nprinciples of the UNGC. To make this\ndetermination, Sustainalytics analyzes\npublicly reported allegations of adverse\nimpacts caused by businesses and provides\nassessments based on the UNGC principles,\ncategorizing those businesses as either \u201c Non-\ncompliant, \u201d \u201c Watchlist, \u201d or \u201c Compliant. \u201d\nCompanies that Sustainalytics determines are\nNon-Compliant typically are causing or\ncontributing to severe and/or systemic\nviolations of international norms and are not\nacting in accordance with the UNGC principles\nand their associated standards, conventions,\nand treaties. All companies that\nSustainalytics determines to be Non-Compliant\nare excluded from the Underlying Index.\nFurther, the Index Provider categorically\nexcludes companies that Sustainalytics has\nassigned a controversy score of 5 (indicating\nthe company experienced an event with a severe\nimpact on the environment and society), or\ncompanies which have not been assigned a\ncontroversy score. Sustainalytics assesses\ncompanies\u2019 involvement in \u201c incidents \u201d with\nnegative environmental, social, and governance\nimplications and assigns a \u201c controversy score\n\u201d , which reflects a company\u2019s level of\ninvolvement in issues and how it manages these\nissues. An incident is a company activity with\nunintended and/or undesired negative\nenvironmental and/or social impacts on\nstakeholders. Incidents are primarily assessed\nbased on the negative environmental and/or\nsocial impact of the company activity as well\nas the reputational risk that this activity\nposes to the company and scored on a scale of\n1 to 10. Incident scores serve as a guide to\nhelp Sustainalytics analysts determine the\nevent rating. \u201c Events \u201d are series of\nisolated or related incidents that pertain to\nthe same ESG issues. An event is assessed on a\nscale of 5 levels, with level 5 being severe,\nand the assessment takes into account the\nscore of each incident comprising the event to\ndetermine the event level. A \u201c controversy \u201d\nis an event or aggregation of events relating\nto an ESG topic. The highest event rating\nunder a controversy indicator automatically\nbecomes the controversy score. Any company\nwhich receives either a controversy score of\n5, or is not assessed at all, is excluded from\nthe Underlying Index. The Index Provider also\nexcludes issuers from the Underlying Index if\nthey exceed any of the following revenue and\nownership thresholds: \u2022 over 5% of an issuer\u2019s\nrevenue is derived from thermal coal\nextraction or generation; \u2022 over 5% of an\nissuer\u2019s revenue is derived from oil sands\nextraction; \u2022 over 5% of an issuer\u2019s business\nis involved in the retail or distribution of\nassault or non-assault weapons; \u2022 over 5% of\nan issuer\u2019s business is involved in the retail\nof tobacco products or tobacco related\nproducts and services; or \u2022 an issuer owns\nover 20% of a business involved in\nantipersonnel mines, biological and chemical\nweapons, cluster weapons, depleted uranium,\nnuclear weapons, or white phosphorous. The\nIndex Provider will apply a series of revenue\nscreens on the resulting eligible\nconstituents.\n\n43\n\nFirst, Morningstar equity analysts evaluate\neach constituent\u2019s revenue that is derived\nfrom \u201c sustainable activities involvement, \u201d\nas calculated by the Index Provider.\nSustainable products could include the\ndistribution and management of energy\nefficient materials or products, or pollution\nremediation services. The Index Provider\ndetermines whether a company has sustainable\nactivities involvement revenue by breaking\ndown the companywide revenue into the\nfollowing eight sustainable themes: Energy\nEfficiency, Green Buildings, Green\nTransportation, Pollution Prevention &\nReduction, Renewable Energy, Resource\nEfficiency Technologies & Services,\nSustainable Agriculture, Food & Forestry, and\nWater. The Index Provider then applies the\nfirst revenue screen, excluding companies with\na total sustainable activities involvement\nrevenue of less than 25% from the Underlying\nIndex. Following the first revenue screen,\nMorningstar equity analysts then research the\nproducts or services identified within the\neight sustainable themes to determine whether\nthe products or services fall within the\nfollowing categories, as defined by\nMorningstar: \u201c green technologies \u201d , \u201c green\nservices \u201d or \u201c green certifications. \u201d Green\ntechnologies are products and services that\nare highly innovative toward sustainability.\nGreen services are services which rely on\ninnovative technologies developed by other\ncompanies. Green certified means that an\nindustry regulator or other third party has\ncertified the product or service as\nsustainable or has certified the elements\nwithin the supply chain of the product or\nservice as sustainable. Morningstar equity\nanalysts consider various metrics to make this\ndetermination ( e.g., research and development\nas a percentage of revenue and company-level\npatent application data). Morningstar excludes\nall revenue tied to products and services\nclassified as \u201c green services \u201d or \u201c green\ncertified. \u201d Morningstar reviews the green\ntechnologies and assesses whether each\nqualifies as an emerging green technology. The\nproducts and services classified as \u201c green\ntechnologies \u201d are assessed by Morningstar\nequity analysts and distributed within the\nRogers Innovation Adoption Curve ( \u201c Adoption\nCurve \u201d ) The Adoption Curve is a theory\ncreated by Professor Everett Rogers that\nexplains the rate at which the population\nadopts a new product, service, or technology\nover time, and which labels each product or\nservice as one of five adoption stages:\nInnovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority,\nLate Majority, and Laggards. Morningstar\nassesses a product or service\u2019s total\naddressable market and current market share to\ndetermine the adoption stage. Morningstar\nEquity Research then classifies the products\nand services that are labeled Innovators,\nEarly Adopters, and Early Majority as \u201c\nemerging green technologies \u201d . Once\nMorningstar identifies the emerging green\ntechnologies, Morningstar then applies a\nsecond revenue screen: companies with 25% or\nmore of their revenue represented by emerging\ngreen technologies are eligible for inclusion\nin the Underlying Index. Following the second\nrevenue screen, the resulting constituents\nreceive an innovation score based on their\nproducts\u2019 and/or services\u2019 adoption stage, as\nfollows: \u2022 Innovation Score of 1: Early\nMajority \u2022 Innovation Score of 2: Early\nAdopters \u2022 Innovation Score of 3: Innovators\nThe Index Provider calculates a company-level\naggregate score by multiplying the company\u2019s\nrevenue percentage of each product and/or\nservice identified as an emerging green\ntechnology within each of the eight\nsustainable themes, and the product and/or\nservice\u2019s innovation score, creating a \u201c\nproduct score \u201d . Each product score is summed\nacross the company\u2019s products and/or services,\nresulting in the company\u2019s aggregate score.\nFor example, suppose Morningstar analyzed\nCompany A\u2019s products and services across the\neight sustainable themes, and found that 71.7%\nof Company A\u2019s revenue is allocated to the\nEnergy Efficiency sustainable theme from\nProduct X, and 28.3% of its revenue is\nallocated to the Green Transportation\nsustainable theme from Product Y. Further,\nMorningstar determined both products to be\nemerging green technologies and that Product X\nis an \u201c innovator \u201d on the Adoption Curve,\nearning an innovation score of 3, and Product\nY is an \u201c early adopter, \u201d earning an\ninnovation score of 2. Each products\u2019 revenues\nare multiplied by their respective innovation\nscores to determine their product scores.\nProduct X\u2019s resulting product score is 2.15\n(71.7% times 3), and Product Y\u2019s resulting\nproduct score is 0.57 (28.3% times 2). Company\nA\u2019s resulting aggregate score is 2.72,\nresulting in a Tier 1 designation. Once\nMorningstar calculates each constituent\u2019s\naggregate score, Morningstar designates each\nconstituent as either Tier 1 or Tier 2 based\non their aggregate score. Tier 1 issuers are\nthose with an aggregate score of 1.5 or\nhigher. Tier 2 issuers are those with an\naggregate score of less than 1.5. All Tier 1\nconstituents are selected for the Underlying\nIndex. The Index Provider ranks Tier 2 issuers\nwith preference given to: \u2022 Higher aggregate\nscore over lower aggregate score \u2022 Smaller\nmarket capitalization over larger market\ncapitalization\n\n44\n\nIf there are fewer than 50 Tier 1\nconstituents, the shortfall is filled with\nTier 2 constituents, and the Underlying Index\nis capped at 50 constituents. Constituents are\nfloat market capitalization-weighted with a 6%\ncap for individual stocks and each industry is\ncapped at 15%. Additionally, individual\nconstituents with weights of 4.5% or greater\ncannot compose more than 45% of the Underlying\nIndex. The Underlying Index is reconstituted\nannually each December and rebalanced\nquarterly. The Index Provider does not require\nthat each of the eight sustainable themes be\nincluded in the Underlying Index, nor does it\nrequire the inclusion of a minimum number of\nTier 1 constituents. In addition, constituents\nmay operate business lines that generate\nrevenues in industries in addition to those\nrelated to breakthrough innovations and new\ntechnologies and may be associated with\nmultiple industries or sectors. Calculation\nMethodology . The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. Morningstar uses the country of\nincorporation of the constituents to determine\nthe relevant dividend withholding tax rates in\ncalculating the net dividends. The regular\ncash dividend is reinvested after deduction of\nwithholding tax by applying the maximum rate\nof the company\u2019s country of incorporation\napplicable to institutional investors. Net\ndividends means dividends after taxes withheld\nat the rate applicable to non-resident\ninstitutional investors who do not benefit\nfrom double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. The MSCI Indexes\nThe MSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by\nCapital International S.A. as international\nperformance benchmarks constructed to\nfacilitate comparison of world markets. The\nMSCI single country standard equity indexes\nhave covered the world's developed markets\nsince 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced coverage\nof emerging markets. Local stock exchanges\ntraditionally calculated their own indexes,\nwhich were generally not comparable with one\nanother due to differences in the\nrepresentation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June 8,\n2023, 23 are classified as developed markets,\n24 as emerging markets, and 21 as frontier\nmarkets (frontier markets exclude the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union, which\nconsists of securities classified in Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau,\nMali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). All listed\nequity securities and listed securities that\nexhibit characteristics of equity securities,\nexcept mutual funds, exchange traded funds,\nequity derivatives, limited partnerships and\nmost investment trusts, are eligible for\ninclusion in the equity universe. REITs in\nsome countries and certain income trusts in\nCanada are also eligible for inclusion. Each\ncompany and its securities ( i.e ., share\nclasses) are classified in only one country.\nDetermining the Market Investable Equity\nUniverse for Each Market. The equity universe\nin any market is derived by applying\ninvestability screens to individual companies\nand securities in that market. Some\ninvestability requirements are applied at the\nindividual security level and some at the\noverall company level, represented by the\naggregation of individual securities of the\ncompany. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company.\n\n45\n\nDetermining Market Capitalization Size\nSegments for Each Market. In order to create\nsize components that can be meaningfully\naggregated into composites, individual market\nsize segments balance the following two\nobjectives: \u2022 Achieving global size integrity\nby ensuring that companies of comparable and\nrelevant sizes are included in a given size\nsegment across all markets in a composite\nindex; and \u2022 Achieving consistent market\ncoverage by ensuring that each market's size\nsegment is represented in its proportional\nweight in the composite universe. The Standard\nIndexes, Large Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes,\nand Small Cap Indexes capture the following\nmarket capitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI\nGlobal Standard Indexes cover all investable\nlarge- and mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes\nprovide coverage in each market by deriving\nthe difference between the market coverage of\nthe MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI\nGlobal Large Cap Index in that market. \u2022 MSCI\nGlobal Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of\ncompanies with a market capitalization below\nthat of the companies in the MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes. Applying Final Size Segment\nInvestability Requirements. In order to\nenhance replicability of the indexes,\nadditional size segment investability\nrequirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and\nMSCI Global Standard Index. These\ninvestability requirements include minimum\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization,\nminimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and\nminimum length of trading. Applying Index\nContinuity Rules for the Standard Index. In\norder to achieve index continuity as well as\nprovide some basic level of diversification\nwithin a market index, notwithstanding the\neffect of other index construction rules\ncontained herein, a minimum number of five\nconstituents will be maintained for a\ndeveloped market Standard Index and a minimum\nnumber of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a free\nfloat of 23.2% will be included in the index\nat 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day.\n\n46\n\nExchange Rates. MSCI uses the World\nMarkets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at\n4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates. Index maintenance can be\ndescribed by three broad categories of\nchanges: \u2022 Semi-Annual Index Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs\n\u201d ), conducted on a fixed semi-annual\ntimetable that systematically reassess the\nvarious dimensions of the equity universe for\nall markets; \u2022 Quarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c\nQIRs \u201d ), aimed at promptly reflecting other\nsignificant market events; and \u2022 Ongoing\nevent-related changes, such as mergers,\nacquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,\nreorganizations and other similar corporate\nevents, which generally are implemented in the\nindexes as they occur. Potential changes in\nthe status of countries (stand-alone,\nfrontier, emerging and developed) follow their\nown implementation time tables. MSCI conducts\nSAIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of May and November. During the\nSAIRs, MSCI updates the investable equity\nuniverse and reassesses size segmentation\ninvestability requirements. MSCI also conducts\nQIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of February and August. During\nthe QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index\nthat were not captured at the time of their\nactual occurrence, but are significant enough\nto be included before the next SAIR. The\nresults of the SAIR and QIR are generally\nannounced at least ten business days in\nadvance of implementation. Creation of Sector\nand Industry Indexes using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI\n25/50 Indexes Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes\n(the \u201c 25/50 Indexes \u201d ) is a sub-index of\neither an MSCI Global Standard Index or an\nMSCI GIMI. Their construction reflects the\ndiversification requirements applicable to\nRICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of \u201c group\nentities \u201d for the concentration limits of the\ncapping methodologies in the 25/50 Indexes. A\ngroup entity is a group of companies that\noperate as an affiliated corporate group but\nmay separately issue listed securities. To\ndetermine \u201c group entities, \u201d MSCI analyzes\nfinancial accounts of listed companies holding\nstakes of 20% or more in other listed\ncompanies to determine whether these stakes\nare controlling in nature. In certain cases,\neven in the absence of consolidated accounts,\nMSCI may also consider two companies as\nbelonging to the same group entity where there\nis reasonable evidence of control based on\nother information. The 25/50 Indexes are free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization-weighted\nindexes with a capping methodology applied to\ngroup entity weights so that no single group\nentity exceeds 25% of index weight, and all\ngroup entities with a weight above 5% do not\ncumulatively exceed 50% of the index weight. A\nbuffer of 10% of the value of each of these\ncaps is used in order to reduce the risk of\nnoncompliance due to short term market\nmovements between rebalances. As a result, at\nthe point of constructing or rebalancing the\n25/50 Indexes, the weight of any single group\nentity cannot exceed 22.5% of the index weight\nand all group entities with weight above 4.5%\ncannot exceed 45% of the index weight. A\nsoftware application called the Barra\nOptimizer is utilized to calculate the capped\n\n47\n\nindex weights through an optimization function\nwhich is aimed at minimizing index turnover,\ntracking error and extreme deviation from the\nuncapped index. MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI Number of\nComponents: approximately 6,698 Index\nDescription. The MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI is an\nMSCI GIMI Index. The Underlying Index captures\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization\nrepresentation across 22 of 23 developed\nmarket countries or regions (excluding the\nU.S.) and 23 emerging market countries. With\n6,698 constituents as of July 31, 2023, the\nUnderlying Index covers approximately 99% of\nthe global equity opportunity set outside the\nU.S. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\nnet dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors.

The\nMSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index is an MSCI\nGlobal Standard Index. The Underlying Index is\ndesigned to address two dimensions of carbon\nexposure \u2013 carbon emissions and potential\ncarbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. By\noverweighting companies with low carbon\nemissions relative to enterprise value\nincluding cash (EVIC) and those with low\npotential carbon emissions from fossil fuel\nreserves relative to market capitalization,\nthe Underlying Index aims to reflect a lower\ncarbon exposure than that of the broad market.\nThe Underlying Index is designed to achieve a\ntarget level of tracking error while\nminimizing carbon exposure. Index Methodology.\nThe Underlying Index begins with the MSCI ACWI\nIndex, the parent index, which serves as the\nuniverse of eligible securities for use in\nconstructing the index. The aim of the\nconstruction methodology is for the Underlying\nIndex to demonstrate the following\ncharacteristics across markets by re-weighting\nconstituents relative to the underlying free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization-weighted\nparent index: (1) lower carbon exposure in\nterms of carbon emissions and fossil fuel\nreserves, (2) low tracking error relative to\nthe parent index, and (3) low active sector,\ncountry and regional biases relative to the\nparent index. The carbon exposure of an issuer\nis measured in terms of its greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and its potential carbon\nemissions from fossil fuel reserves.\nGreenhouse gas emissions of the issuer\nincludes direct greenhouse gas emissions by\nthe issuer, indirect greenhouse gas emissions\nassociated with the issuer\u2019s purchase of\nenergy, and indirect emissions occurring in\nthe value chain of the issuer (in each case,\nas determined by the Index Provider). The\nUnderlying Index uses MSCI ESG Carbon Metrics\ndata provided by MSCI ESG Research Inc. MSCI\nnormalizes for size by dividing the annual\ncarbon emissions of the company EVIC of the\ncompany, and by dividing the potential carbon\nemissions from fossil fuel reserves of the\ncompany by its market capitalization. At each\nsemi-annual index review, the Underlying Index\nis rebalanced using an optimization process\nthat aims to achieve replicability and\ninvestability, subject to the following\noptimization objectives and constraints: \u2022\nExclude companies involved with controversial\nweapons, companies involved in very severe ESG\ncontroversies and\n\n48\n\ncompanies involved in the business of thermal\ncoal mining and extraction of oil sands, based\non percentage of revenue thresholds for\ncertain categories ( e.g. , 1% or 5%) and\ncategorical exclusions for others ( e.g. ,\ncontroversial weapons) (in each case as\ndetermined by the Index Provider). \u2022 Minimize\nthe carbon exposure subject to a tracking\nerror constraint of 50 basis points relative\nto the parent index; \u2022 The maximum weight of\nan index constituent will be restricted to 20\ntimes its weight in the parent index; \u2022 The\ncountry weights in the Underlying Index will\nnot deviate more than +/-2% from the country\nweights in the parent index; and \u2022 The sector\nweights in the Underlying Index will not\ndeviate more than +/-2% from the sector\nweights in the parent index with the exception\nof the energy sector where no sector weight\nconstraint is applied.

The STOXX\nIndexes STOXX Total Market Indexes Each of the\nSTOXX Total Market Indexes is a subset of the\nSTOXX Global Total Market index (the \u201c Global\nTMI \u201d ), which represents 95 percent of the\nfree float market capitalization worldwide,\nwith a variable number of components. The\nSTOXX global equity universe includes all\ncommon stocks and equities with similar\ncharacteristics from financial markets that\nprovide real-time and historical component and\ncurrency pricing. The Global TMI is the\nfraction of the STOXX investable universe\nlisted on eligible stock exchanges. The STOXX\nCountry Total Market indexes form the basis\nfor all regional STOXX Total Market indexes\n(each, a \u201c Regional TMI \u201d ). Each STOXX\nCountry Total Market index aims to represent a\nbroad market and covers at least 95 percent of\nthe free float market capitalization of the\nrespective country\u2019s investable universe. Each\nof the STOXX Total Market Indexes is derived\nfrom its respective Regional TMI(s).\n\n54\n\nSTOXX World Equity Indexes The STOXX World\nEquity Indexes includes a number of regional,\ncountry and sector equity indexes which are\nmodular components of the STOXX World AC All\nCap Index (AC stand for All Countries). The\nSTOXX World AC All Cap Index aims to provide a\nbroad universe that includes all investable\nstocks, ADR\u2019s and GDR\u2019s from all developed and\nemerging markets in the world. Large Cap, Mid\nCap and Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of\napproximately the top 70 percent, 85 percent\nand 95 percent of each respective countries\u2019\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization. The\nuniverse for all countries besides China, is\nthe combination of the respective STOXX\nCountry Total Market Index, the respective\ncountry\u2019s constituents in the STOXX GCC Total\nMarket Index (a Regional TMI that aims to\nrepresent the Gulf Cooperation Council\ncountries market, which consists of Bahrain,\nKuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the\nUnited Arab Emirates) and the respective\ncountry\u2019s constituents of the STOXX World DR\nIndex (a free-float market capitalization-\nweighted index of depositary receipts whose\nuniverse includes ADRs and GDRs that are\ntraded on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,\nor the London Stock Exchange). For China the\nuniverse is the aggregate of the STOXX China\nTotal Market Index, the STOXX China A Total\nMarket Index, the STOXX China P-Chip Total\nMarket Index, and the China constituents in\nthe STOXX Global DR Index. STOXX Global Equity\nFactor Index Number of Components:\napproximately 690 Index Description. The STOXX\nGlobal Equity Factor Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ) is a subset of the STOXX World AC\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a free\nfloat market capitalization-weighted index\ndesigned to measure the performance of large-\nand mid\u2011capitalization companies from\ndeveloped and emerging markets. Large- and\nmid\u2011capitalization companies, as calculated by\nthe Index Provider, represent approximately\nthe top 85% of the investable market\ncapitalization of each developed and emerging\nmarket country included in the Parent Index,\nas defined by STOXX. Free float market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying\nthe total market capitalization of a security\nby a free float factor, as determined by the\nIndex Provider, to reflect the market\ncapitalization of the number of shares\navailable in the market (rather than that of\nthe total number of shares outstanding). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of small-\ncapitalization equity securities from the\nParent Index that are selected and weighted\nusing an optimization process designed to\nmaximize exposure to five target factors:\nmomentum, quality, value, low volatility and\nsize. The Underlying Index also seeks to\nmitigate exposure to unintended systematic\nexposures, limit turnover and maintain a level\nof risk similar to that of the Parent Index.\nIndex Methodology. The momentum score is\ncalculated from the following signals: price\nmomentum, earnings momentum and earnings\nannouncement drift ( i.e ., the difference\nbetween a stock\u2019s performance on and\nimmediately following an earnings announcement\ndate). The quality score is calculated from\nthe following signals: gross profitability,\nshare dilution, accruals, changes in net\noperating assets, carbon emissions intensity\nand greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) reduction\ntargets. Carbon emissions intensity is based\non the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions ( i.e., direct emissions from\nsources that an issuer owns or controls and\nindirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s purchase\nof energy) relative to peers in its Industry\nClassification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ). The GHG\ntargets signal is based on the robustness of\nan issuer\u2019s GHG reduction targets, including\nwhether they are part of the Science Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ) framework;\nthis is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG\nratings data and SBTi data. The value score is\ncalculated from the following signals: current\nbook value\u2011to\u2011price ratio, dividend yield (\ni.e. , 12-month trailing dividend divided by\ntotal market capitalization), earnings yield\n(i.e., 12-month net income divided by total\nmarket capitalization), cash flow yield (\ni.e., 12-month cash flow divided by total\nmarket capitalization) and time series\nnormalized cash flow yield over the previous\n36 months. The low volatility score is based\non prior 12-month volatility, as calculated by\nthe Index Provider. The size score seeks to\nmeasure an issuer\u2019s market capitalization\nrelative to other companies in the Parent\nIndex. The Index Provider derives a composite\nscore based on a combination of the five\nfactors at the following weights: momentum,\n27%; quality, 36%; value, 27%; low volatility,\n5%; and size, 5%. The composite score is an\ninput to the optimization process through\nwhich the Index Provider selects securities\nfrom the Parent Index and assigns weights. The\noptimization process seeks to maximize the\noverall exposure to the five factors while\napplying certain constraints, which include\nthe following:\n\n55\n\n\u2022 A constituent\u2019s minimum weight is the\ngreater of 0% and its weight in the Parent\nIndex minus 2%. \u2022 A constituent\u2019s maximum\nweight is the lesser of its weight in the\nParent Index plus 2% and 20 times its Parent\nIndex weight. \u2022 The maximum weight for a\nsingle issuer is 10% of the Underlying Index.\n\u2022 The sum of issuer weights that are\nindividually greater than 4.5% must be less\nthan 22.5% of the Underlying Index. \u2022 The\nmaximum exposure to each ICB Industry (Level\n1) (as defined by the Index Provider) must be\nwithin 2% of the exposure in the Parent Index.\n\u2022 The exposure to a particular country must be\nwithin 5% of the exposure in the Parent Index.\n\u2022 The maximum one-way turnover at each\nquarterly rebalance is 5%. \u2022 The maximum ex\nante tracking error relative to the Parent\nIndex is 1%. \u2022 Constraints are also applied\nfor the minimum and maximum exposures to the\nfive factors relative to the Parent Index. \u2022 A\nconstituent\u2019s maximum weight is also subject\nto liquidity constraints. The Underlying Index\nis reviewed and rebalanced each March, June,\nSeptember and December. Investment Policies\nThe Board has adopted as fundamental policies\nthe following numbered investment policies,\nwhich cannot be changed without the approval\nof the holders of a majority of the applicable\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities. A vote\nof a majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a Fund is defined in the 1940\nAct as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the\nvoting securities present at a shareholder\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (ii)\nmore than 50% of outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. Each Fund has also adopted\ncertain non-fundamental investment policies,\nincluding its investment objective. Non-\nfundamental investment policies may be changed\nby the Board without shareholder approval.\nTherefore, each Fund may change its investment\nobjective and its Underlying Index without\nshareholder approval.

Notations Regarding\neach of the iShares Breakthrough Environmental\nSolutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI International\nDeveloped Markets ETF, iShares Cybersecurity\nand Tech ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low\nCarbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI China A ETF,\niShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF,\niShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and\niShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector's\nFundamental Investment Policies The following\nnotations are not considered to be part of\neach Fund\u2019s fundamental investment policies\nand are subject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of industries\nconstitutes concentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities; securities of\nstate, territory, possession or municipal\ngovernments and their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\neach Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits each Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires each Fund to maintain at all\ntimes an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300%\nof the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of\neach Fund's total assets (including amounts\nborrowed), minus liabilities other than\nborrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of\nall borrowings. Borrowing money to increase\nportfolio holdings is known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d\nCertain trading practices and investments,\nsuch as reverse repurchase agreements, may be\nconsidered to be borrowings or involve\nleverage and thus are subject to the\nInvestment Company Act restrictions. In\naccordance with Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act, when each Fund engages\nin reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions, the Fund may either\n(i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law.\n\n58\n\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to lending set forth in (7) above,\nthe Investment Company Act does not prohibit\neach Fund from making loans (including lending\nits securities); however, SEC staff\ninterpretations currently prohibit funds from\nlending more than one-third of their total\nassets (including lending its securities),\nexcept through the purchase of debt\nobligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies iShares\nBreakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF,\niShares Core MSCI International Developed\nMarkets ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI Low\nCarbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI China A ETF,\niShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF,\niShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF and\niShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector ETF\nEach Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy\nnot to make short sales of securities or\nmaintain a short position, except to the\nextent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and\nSAI, as amended from time to time, and\napplicable law. All Funds Other Than the\niShares Breakthrough Environmental Solutions\nETF, iShares Core MSCI International Developed\nMarkets ETF, iShares Cybersecurity and Tech\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares MSCI\nChina A ETF, iShares Neuroscience and\nHealthcare ETF , iShares Self-Driving EV and\nTech ETF and iShares Virtual Work and Life\nMultisector ETF Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to invest in the\nsecurities of a company for the purpose of\nexercising management or control, or purchase\nor otherwise acquire any illiquid investment,\nexcept as permitted under the 1940 Act, which\ncurrently limits each Fund's holdings in\nilliquid investments to 15% of a Fund's net\nassets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid\ninvestments, pursuant to the Liquidity\nProgram. If any percentage restriction\ndescribed above is complied with at the time\nof an investment, a later increase or decrease\nin percentage resulting from a change in\nvalues of assets will not constitute a\nviolation of such restriction, except that\ncertain percentage limitations will be\nobserved continuously in accordance with\napplicable law. All Funds Each Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act\nto invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in component securities of the\nUnderlying Index or in depositary receipts\nrepresenting component securities in the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a\npolicy to provide its shareholders with at\nleast 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of any\nchange in such policy. If, subsequent to an\ninvestment, the 80% requirement is no longer\nmet, a Fund\u2019s future investments will be made\nin a manner that will bring the Fund into\ncompliance with this policy. Each Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental policy not to\npurchase securities of other investment\ncompanies, except to the extent permitted by\nthe 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however,\na Fund will not purchase shares of any\nregistered open-end investment company or\nregistered unit investment trust, in reliance\non Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u201c fund of\nfunds \u201d provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any\ntime the Fund has knowledge that its shares\nare purchased by another investment company\ninvestor in reliance on the provisions of\nsubparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). Unless\notherwise indicated, all limitations under\neach Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental\ninvestment policies apply only at the time\nthat a transaction is undertaken. Any change\nin the percentage of each Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in each Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require each Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term\n\n59\n\nis used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-\ndealers and other persons are cautioned that\nsome activities on their part may, depending\non the circumstances, result in their being\ndeemed participants in a distribution in a\nmanner that could render them statutory\nunderwriters and subject them to the\nprospectus delivery requirement and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. For example, a\nbroker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed\na statutory underwriter if it takes Creation\nUnits after placing an order with the\nDistributor, breaks them down into constituent\nshares and sells such shares directly to\ncustomers or if it chooses to couple the\ncreation of new shares with an active selling\neffort involving solicitation of secondary\nmarket demand for shares. A determination of\nwhether one is an underwriter for purposes of\nthe 1933 Act must take into account all of the\nfacts and circumstances pertaining to the\nactivities of the broker-dealer or its client\nin the particular case and the examples\nmentioned above should not be considered a\ncomplete description of all the activities\nthat could lead to a categorization as an\nunderwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also\nnote that dealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d\nbut are effecting transactions in shares,\nwhether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Funds\nrests with the Board. The Board has engaged\nBFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing BFA\nand other service providers in the operations\nof the Funds in accordance with the provisions\nof the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of\nstate and other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter.\nThe Board is currently composed of eleven\nmembers, nine of whom are Independent\nTrustees. The Board currently conducts regular\nin person meetings four times a year. In\naddition, the Board frequently holds special\nin person or telephonic meetings or informal\nconference calls to discuss specific matters\nthat may arise or require action between\nregular meetings. The Independent Trustees\nmeet regularly outside the presence of\nmanagement, in executive session or with other\nservice providers to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Funds' investment performance\nor other activities.\n\n68\n\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees. The\nmembers of the Audit Committee are Richard L.\nFagnani (Chair), Laura F. Fergerson, Cecilia\nH. Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom\nis an Independent Trustee.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFunds. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or\n\n83\n\notherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or\ninvestment strategies of a Fund, particularly,\nbut not limited to, with respect to small-\ncapitalization, emerging market or less liquid\nstrategies. This may occur with respect to\nBlackRock-advised accounts when investment\ndecisions regarding a Fund are based on\nresearch or other information that is also\nused to support decisions for other accounts.\nWhen BlackRock implements a portfolio decision\nor strategy on behalf of another account ahead\nof, or contemporaneously with, similar\ndecisions or strategies for a Fund, market\nimpact, liquidity constraints, or other\nfactors could result in the Fund receiving\nless favorable trading results and the costs\nof implementing such decisions or strategies\ncould be increased or the Fund could otherwise\nbe disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when a\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of\n\n84\n\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing a Fund. The Funds may be\nincluded in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Funds, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFunds to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of a Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such other business units or entities or\ntheir clients and such obligations to other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nmay be a consideration of which investors in a\nFund should be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Funds or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund. At\ntimes, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of a\nFund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arm\u2019s-length basis. To the extent\nauthorized by applicable law, BlackRock may\nact as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial\nadvisory fees, underwriting and placement\nfees, sales fees, financing and commitment\nfees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation\nor profits, rates, terms and conditions\ncharged by BlackRock will be in its view\ncommercially reasonable, although BlackRock,\nincluding its sales personnel, will have an\ninterest in obtaining fees and other amounts\nthat are favorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of a Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Funds as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother\n\n85\n\ncommercial capacities. No accounting to the\nFunds or their shareholders will be required,\nand no fees or other compensation payable by\nthe Funds or their shareholders will be\nreduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of\nany such fees or other amounts. When BlackRock\nacts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities in relation to the\nFunds, BlackRock may take commercial steps in\nits own interests, which may have an adverse\neffect on the Funds. A Fund will be required\nto establish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with a Fund's establishment of its\nbusiness relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of\n\n86\n\nthe Funds. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, the Funds will not be charged\nthe same commission or commission equivalent\nrates in connection with a bunched or\naggregated order. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI.\n\n87\n\nIt is also possible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of a\nFund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s assets may enhance\nliquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor\nevents (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to a Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, each Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas each Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic\n\n88\n\ninterest of existing shareholders and may\naffect the amount of revenue received by BFA\nwith respect to services for which it receives\nan asset-based fee. To the extent permitted by\napplicable law, a Fund may invest all or some\nof its short-term cash investments in any\nmoney market fund or similarly-managed private\nfund advised or managed by BlackRock. In\nconnection with any such investments, a Fund,\nto the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may\npay its share of expenses of a money market\nfund or other similarly-managed private fund\nin which it invests, which may result in a\nFund bearing some additional expenses.\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities or\nother investments for their own accounts and\nmay have conflicts of interest with respect to\ninvestments made on behalf of a Fund. As a\nresult of differing trading and investment\nstrategies or constraints, positions may be\ntaken by directors, officers and employees\nthat are the same, different from or made at\ndifferent times than positions taken for a\nFund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund\nwill be adversely affected by this personal\ntrading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have\neach adopted a code of ethics in compliance\nwith Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that\nrestricts securities trading in the personal\naccounts of investment professionals and\nothers who normally come into possession of\ninformation regarding a Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of each Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\na Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance\nwith rules or guidance adopted under the 1940\nAct engage in transactions with another Fund\nor accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as\na result of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when BlackRock may not initiate\nor recommend certain types of transactions, or\nmay otherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds.\n\n89\n\nIn those circumstances where ownership\nthresholds or limitations must be observed,\nBlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment\nopportunities equitably among clients\n(including the Funds), taking into\nconsideration benchmark weight and investment\nstrategy. BlackRock has adopted certain\ncontrols designed to prevent the occurrence of\na breach of any applicable ownership threshold\nor limits, including, for example, when\nownership in certain securities nears an\napplicable threshold, BlackRock may remove\nsuch securities from the list of Deposit\nSecurities to be delivered to the Fund in\nconnection with purchases of Creation Units of\nsuch Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFunds may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of their investment strategy. Index\nbased funds that seek to track the performance\nof securities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund.\n\n90\n\nPresent and future activities of BlackRock\n(including BFA), its directors, officers and\nemployees, in addition to those described in\nthis section, may give rise to additional\nconflicts of interest. Investment Advisory,\nAdministrative and Distribution Services\nInvestment Adviser. BFA serves as investment\nadviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment\nadvisory agreement between the Trust, on\nbehalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an\ninvestment adviser under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to\nthe supervision of the Board and in conformity\nwith the stated investment policies of each\nFund, manages and administers the Trust and\nthe investment of each Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of each Fund.\nPursuant to the investment advisory agreement,\nBFA may, from time to time, in its sole\ndiscretion and to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, appoint one or more sub-\nadvisers, including, without limitation,\naffiliates of BFA, to perform investment\nadvisory or other services with respect to a\nFund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of\nits investment advisory functions under the\ninvestment advisory agreement to one or more\nof its affiliates to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. BFA may terminate any or all\nsub-advisers or such delegation arrangements\nin its sole discretion upon appropriate notice\nat any time to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. BFA is responsible, under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, for\nsubstantially all expenses of the Funds,\nincluding the cost of transfer agency,\ncustody, fund administration, legal, audit and\nother services. BFA is not responsible for,\nand the Funds will bear, the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees). The\nfollowing describes the calculation of the\nmanagement fee for each Fund whose management\nfee is subject to breakpoints. The management\nfee for all Funds is set forth in the table\nthat follows the description of breakpoints.\nFor its investment advisory services to the\niShares MSCI ACWI ETF and iShares MSCI ACWI ex\nU.S. ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from\neach Fund corresponding to the Fund\u2019s\nallocable portion of an aggregate management\nfee calculated based on the aggregate average\ndaily net assets of the following iShares\nfunds: iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, iShares MSCI\nACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE ETF,\niShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor ETF and\niShares MSCI Global Min Vol Factor ETF.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nit would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts.\n\n93\n\nLike the Funds, the other portfolios or\naccounts for which the Portfolio Managers are\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Funds should be aware\nthat, as with any group of portfolios and\naccounts managed by an investment adviser\nand/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of July 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts       Fees Managed   Total Assets  \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,396,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of July 31, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the\n\n94\n\nteam relative to the portfolios\u2019 investment\nobjectives (which in the case of index ETFs\nwould be how closely the ETF tracks its\nUnderlying Index), and the individual\u2019s\nperformance and contribution to the overall\nperformance of these portfolios and BlackRock.\nDiscretionary incentive compensation is paid\nin cash up to a certain threshold with the\nremaining portion represented by deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases,\nadditional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may\nbe granted to certain key employees as part of\na long-term incentive award to aid in\nretention, align interests with long-term\nshareholders and motivate performance.

Distributor. The\nDistributor's principal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Funds\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the applicable\nProspectus and below in the Creation and\nRedemption of Creation Units section of this\nSAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits are generally not distributed by the\nDistributor or its agent. The Distributor or\nits agent will arrange for the delivery of the\napplicable Prospectus and, upon request, this\nSAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and\nwill maintain records of both orders placed\nwith it or its agents and confirmations of\nacceptance furnished by it or its agents. The\nDistributor is a broker-dealer registered\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,\nInc. ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for each Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the relevant Fund.

BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees a Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Funds are categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of a Fund\u2019s asset class category\n(fixed-income, domestic equity, international\nequity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be\nsubject to a different fee arrangement, is\nbased on a methodology agreed to by the Trust\nand BTC. Pursuant to the current Securities\nLending Agency Agreement:\n\n98\n\n(i) domestic equity funds, such as the iShares\nCybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares Future\nCloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF and iShares\nVirtual Work and Life Multisector ETF ( \u201c\nDomestic Equity Funds \u201d ), retain 81% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) and (ii) this\namount could never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. (i) international equity\nfunds, such as all Funds except for the\niShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF and iShares\nVirtual Work and Life Multisector ETF ( \u201c\nInternational Equity Funds \u201d ), retain 82% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex (as defined in the\nManagement \u2014 Trustees and Officers section of\nthis SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each applicable\ninternational equity fund, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: Domestic Equity Funds (i) 81% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees); and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. International Equity Funds\n(i) 85% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees); and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Funds by BTC in the most\nrecent fiscal year ended July 31, 2023\nprimarily included the following: (1)\nselecting borrowers from an approved list of\nborrowers and executing a securities lending\nagreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with\neach such borrower; (2) negotiating the terms\nof securities loans, including the amount of\nfees; (3) directing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities; (4) monitoring the daily value of\nthe loaned securities and directing the\npayment of additional collateral or the return\nof excess collateral, as necessary; (5)\ninvesting cash collateral received in\nconnection with any loaned securities; (6)\nmonitoring distributions on loaned securities\n(for example, interest and dividend activity);\n(7) in the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination.

In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Funds, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products. Payments of the\ntype described above are sometimes referred to\nas revenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and\n\n104\n\nother intermediaries and in advertising\ncampaigns as the preferred exchange-traded\nproduct, to offer certain iShares funds in\ncertain Fidelity platforms and investment\nprograms, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, and to\nprovide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA\nEntities have agreed to facilitate the\nMarketing Program by, among other things,\nmaking certain payments to FBS and NFS for\nmarketing and implementing certain brokerage\nand investment programs. Upon termination of\nthe arrangement, the BFA Entities will make\nadditional payments to FBS and/or NFS based\nupon a number of criteria, including the\noverall success of the Marketing Program and\nthe level of services provided by FBS and NFS\nduring the wind-down period. In addition, BFA\nEntities may enter into other contractual\narrangements with Intermediaries and certain\nother third parties that the BFA Entities\nbelieve may benefit the iShares business or\nfacilitate investment in iShares funds. Such\nagreements may include payments by BFA\nEntities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund is\ngenerally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as\nfollows: Equity Investments. Equity securities\ntraded on a recognized securities exchange (\ne.g. , NYSE), on separate trading boards of a\nsecurities exchange or through a market system\nthat provides contemporaneous transaction\npricing information (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d )\nare valued using information obtained via\nindependent pricing services, generally at the\nclosing price or, if an Exchange closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on\nthat Exchange prior to the time as of which\nthe assets or\n\n105\n\nliabilities are valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by a Fund on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such security, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Options, Futures, Swaps and Other\nDerivatives. Exchange-traded equity options\n(except those that are customized) for which\nmarket quotations are readily available are\nvalued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used in the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could result in a\ndifference between a Fund\u2019s performance and\nthe performance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this\n\n106\n\npurpose, a \u201c significant event \u201d is deemed to\noccur if BFA determines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment, that an event has occurred\nafter the close of trading for an asset or\nliability but prior to or at the time of\npricing a Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities, is\nlikely to cause a material change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing market price\nof one or more assets held by, or liabilities\nof, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a\nforeign market or the primary exchange on\nwhich a foreign asset or liability is traded\nis closed, such asset or liability will be\nvalued using the prior day\u2019s price, provided\nthat BFA is not aware of any significant event\nor other information that would cause such\nprice to no longer reflect the fair value of\nthe asset or liability, in which case such\nasset or liability would be treated as a Fair\nValue Asset. For certain foreign assets, a\nthird-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s\nRule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for\nreviewing and approving methodologies by\ninvestment type and significant inputs used in\nthe fair valuation of Fund assets or\nliabilities. In addition, a Fund\u2019s accounting\nagent assists BFA by periodically endeavoring\nto confirm the prices it receives from all\nthird-party pricing services, index providers\nand broker-dealers and regularly evaluating\nthe values assigned to the securities and\nother assets and liabilities of a Fund. The\npricing of all Fair Value Assets is\nsubsequently reported to the Board or a\ncommittee thereof. When determining the price\nfor a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage\n\n107\n\ncommission or dealer spread), size of order,\ndifficulty of execution, operational\nfacilities of the firm and the firm\u2019s risk and\nskill in positioning blocks of securities.\nWhile BFA generally seeks reasonable trade\nexecution costs, a Fund does not necessarily\npay the lowest spread or commission available,\nand payment of the lowest commission or spread\nis not necessarily consistent with obtaining\nthe best price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFunds anticipate that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFunds in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Funds will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with a Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer.\n\n108\n\nBFA may, from time to time, effect trades on\nbehalf of and for the account of the Funds\nwith brokers or dealers that are affiliated\nwith BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under\nthe 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations.\nUnder these provisions, any commissions paid\nto affiliated brokers or dealers must be\nreasonable and fair compared to the\ncommissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. Securities\npurchased in underwritten offerings include a\nfixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFunds or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a\n\n109\n\nmore favorable execution at a potentially\nlower execution cost. The costs associated\nwith a bunched order will be shared pro rata\namong the clients in the bunched order.\nGenerally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The table\nbelow sets forth the brokerage commissions\npaid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted.\nAny differences in brokerage commissions paid\nby a Fund from year to year are principally\ndue to increases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s\nassets over those periods or the magnitude of\nchanges to the components of a Fund's\nUnderlying Index:\n                                              \n

If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Funds and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder.

Creation or\nredemption transactions, to the extent\nconsisting of cash, may require a Fund to\ncontemporaneously transact with broker-dealers\nfor purchases of Deposit Securities (as\ndefined below under Fund Deposit ) or sales of\nFund Securities (as defined below under\nRedemption of Creation Units ), as applicable.\nSuch transactions with a particular broker-\ndealer may be\n\n112\n\nconditioned upon the broker-dealer's agreement\nto transact at guaranteed price levels in\norder to reduce transaction costs the Funds\nwould otherwise incur as a consequence of\nsettling creation or redemption baskets in\ncash rather than in-kind. Following a Fund's\nreceipt of an order to purchase or redeem\ncreation or redemption baskets, to the extent\nsuch purchases or redemptions consist of a\ncash portion, the Funds will enter an order\nwith a broker or dealer to purchase or sell\nthe Deposit Securities or Fund Securities, as\napplicable. The terms of such order may,\ndepending on the timing of the transaction and\ncertain other factors, require the broker or\ndealer to guarantee that the Funds will\nachieve execution of their order at a price at\nleast as favorable to the Funds as the Funds'\nvaluation of the Deposit Securities/Fund\nSecurities used for purposes of calculating\nthe NAV applied to the creation or redemption\ntransaction giving rise to the order (the \u201c\nExecution Performance Guarantee \u201d ). Such\norders may be placed with the purchasing or\nredeeming Authorized Participant (or a broker-\ndealer affiliated with the Authorized\nParticipant or a third-party broker-dealer\nengaged through the Authorized Participant) in\nits capacity as a broker-dealer. The amount\npayable to the Funds in respect of any\nExecution Performance Guarantee will depend on\nthe results achieved by the executing firm and\nwill vary depending on market activity, timing\nand a variety of other factors. The Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will apply for any\norders executed by the Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), even if the trades have not settled\nbefore the redemption transaction settles. To\nensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee\nwill be honored on orders arising from\ncreation transactions executed by an\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized\nParticipant is required to deposit an amount\nwith the Funds (the \u201c Execution Performance\nDeposit \u201d ). If the broker-dealer executing\nthe order achieves executions in market\ntransactions at a price more favorable than\nthe Funds' valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the benefit of the\nfavorable executions, and the Fund will return\nto the Authorized Participant the Execution\nPerformance Deposit. If, however, the broker-\ndealer executing the order is unable to\nachieve executions in market transactions at a\nprice at least equal to the Funds' valuation\nof the securities, the Funds retain the\nportion of the Execution Performance Deposit\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs) and may require\nthe Authorized Participant to deposit any\nadditional amount required to cover the full\namount of the actual Execution Performance\nGuarantee. To ensure that an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will be honored for\nbrokerage orders arising from redemption\ntransactions executed by an Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an Authorized\nParticipant agrees to pay the shortfall amount\n(the \u201c Execution Performance Offset \u201d ). If\nthe broker-dealer executing the order achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the Funds' valuation of\nthe Fund Securities, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the benefit\nof the favorable executions and the Authorized\nParticipant is not called upon to honor the\nExecution Performance Offset. If, however, the\nbroker-dealer is unable to achieve executions\nin market transactions at a price at least\nequal to the Funds' valuation of the\nsecurities, the Funds will be entitled to the\nportion of the Execution Performance Offset\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs). The circumstances\nunder which the Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be used and the expected amount\nof any Execution Performance Deposit or\nExecution Performance Offset for the Funds\nwill be disclosed in the procedures handbook\nfor Authorized Participants and may change\nfrom time to time based on the actual\nexperience of the Funds. Additional\nInformation Concerning the Trust Shares. The\nTrust issues shares of beneficial interests in\nthe funds with no par value. The Board may\ndesignate additional iShares funds. Each share\nissued by a fund has a pro rata interest in\nthe assets of that fund. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the relevant fund, and\nin the net distributable assets of such fund\non liquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\n\n113\n\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee\n\n114\n\nto be charged to the Trust a listing of the\nshares of each Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust shall inquire of each\nsuch DTC Participant as to the number of\nBeneficial Owners holding shares, directly or\nindirectly, through such DTC Participant. The\nTrust shall provide each such DTC Participant\nwith copies of such notice, statement or other\ncommunication, in such form, number and at\nsuch place as such DTC Participant may\nreasonably request, in order that such notice,\nstatement or communication may be transmitted\nby such DTC Participant, directly or\nindirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder\nof all shares of the Trust. DTC or its\nnominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on each Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to be placed earlier in the day.

A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of each Fund\n(except for the iShares MSCI China A ETF,\nwhich is generally offered in Creation Units\nsolely for cash), generally consists of\nDeposit Securities and the Cash Component\ncomputed as described below. Together, the\nDeposit Securities and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which, when\ncombined with a Fund's portfolio securities,\nis designed to generate performance that has a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of any\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject\nto any adjustments as described below, to\npurchases of Creation Units of shares of the\nFund until such time as the next-announced\nFund Deposit is made available. The \u201c Cash\nComponent \u201d is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d\nwhich is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing a Creation Unit. Each\nFund (except for the iShares MSCI China A ETF)\ngenerally offers Creation Units partially for\ncash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units solely for cash or solely in-\nkind. The iShares MSCI China A ETF\u2019s current\npolicy is to accept cash (which may include\nthe currency in which the underlying\nsecurities are denominated) in substitution\nfor the Deposit Securities it might otherwise\naccept as in-kind consideration for the\npurchase of Creation Units. The Fund may, at\ntimes, elect to receive Deposit Securities (\ni.e ., the in-kind deposit of a designated\nportfolio of securities) and a Cash Component\nas consideration for the purchase of Creation\nUnits. If the Fund elects to accept Deposit\nSecurities, a purchaser\u2019s delivery of the\nDeposit Securities together with the Cash\nComponent will constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit,\n\u201d which will represent the consideration for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. Please see the Cash\n\n116\n\nPurchase Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the Deposit\nSecurity method for further information on\npurchasing Creation Units of the Funds. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of a Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nrelevant Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nDeposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit\nthrough \u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified (Creation Units of the\niShares MSCI China A ETF are generally offered\nsolely for cash, while Creation Units of all\nother Funds in this SAI are generally offered\npartially for cash), they will be effected in\nessentially the same manner as in-kind\npurchases thereof. In the case of a partial or\nfull cash purchase, the Authorized Participant\nmust pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit\nSecurities it would otherwise be required to\nprovide through an in-kind purchase, plus the\nsame Cash Component required to be paid by an\nin-kind purchaser. The Authorized Participant\nwill also be required to pay certain\ntransaction fees and charges for cash\npurchases, as described below, and, if\ntransacting as broker with each Fund, may be\nrequired to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Procedures\nfor Creation of Creation Units. To be eligible\nto place orders with the Distributor and to\ncreate a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity\nmust be: (i) a \u201c Participating Party, \u201d i.e .,\na broker-dealer or other participant in the\nclearing process through the Continuous Net\nSettlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing\nProcess \u201d ), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC\nParticipant, and must have executed an\nagreement with the Distributor, with respect\nto creations and redemptions of Creation Units\n( \u201c Authorized Participant Agreement \u201d )\n(discussed below). A member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\nis referred to as an \u201c Authorized Participant.\n\u201d All shares of the Funds, however created,\nwill be entered on the records of DTC in the\nname of Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\n(an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\n\n117\n\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of a Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of a\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Funds to the Distributor or\nits agent pursuant to procedures set forth in\nthe Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of a Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as that Fund's\n\u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with a\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once a Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. Each Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, a\n\n118\n\nFund may reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent if (i) the order is not in proper form;\n(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nshares ordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding shares of the Fund;\n(iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not\nconform to the identity and number of shares\nspecified, as described above; (iv) acceptance\nof the Deposit Securities is not legally\nrequired or would, in the opinion of counsel,\nbe unlawful ; or (v) circumstances outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Distributor or its\nagent and BFA make it impracticable to process\npurchase orders. The Distributor or its agent\nshall notify a prospective purchaser of a\nCreation Unit and/or the Authorized\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Funds,\nState Street, the sub-custodian and the\nDistributor or its agent are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. In addition, the iShares Core\nMSCI Total International Stock ETF may\nexercise its right to reject any creation\norder for shares of the Fund on any Business\nDay that is a holiday in the Indian market\nthat is not a holiday observed in the U.S.\nequity market and certain other holidays\nduring the settlement cycle for Fund shares in\norder to protect Fund shareholders from any\ndilutive costs that may be associated with the\npurchase of Deposit Securities in connection\nwith creation orders on such days. Issuance of\na Creation Unit. Except as provided herein, a\nCreation Unit will not be issued until the\ntransfer of good title to the applicable Fund\nof the Deposit Securities and the payment of\nthe Cash Component have been completed. When\nthe sub-custodian has confirmed to the\ncustodian that the securities included in the\nFund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have\nbeen delivered to the account of the relevant\nsub-custodian or sub-custodians, the\nDistributor or its agent and BFA shall be\nnotified of such delivery and the applicable\nFund will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Unit. For the iShares MSCI China A\nETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a\n\u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e. , one Business Day after\ntrade date). For the iShares Breakthrough\nEnvironmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI\nEAFE ETF, iShares Core MSCI International\nDeveloped Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total\nInternational Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity\nand Tech ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF,\niShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI\nACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All\nCountry Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares\nNeuroscience and Healthcare ETF, iShares Self-\nDriving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual\nWork and Multisector ETF, Creation Units are\ngenerally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d ( i.e. ,\ntwo Business Days after trade date). However,\neach Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a basis other\nthan T+1 or T+2, including a shorter\nsettlement period, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. For example, each Fund\nreserves the right to settle Creation Unit\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1 or T+2\nin order to accommodate non-U.S. market\nholiday schedules, to account for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (\ni.e. , the last day the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security) and in\ncertain other circumstances. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\nAgreement with the Distributor, each Fund will\nissue Creation Units to such Authorized\nParticipant, notwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Funds. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby a Fund or its custodian on the contractual\nsettlement date. Information concerning the\nFunds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Funds to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Funds of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Funds reserve the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by each\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions.\n\n119\n\nA standard creation transaction fee is imposed\nto offset the transfer, processing and other\ntransaction costs associated with the issuance\nof Creation Units. The standard creation\ntransaction fee is charged on each Creation\nUnit created by an Authorized Participant on\nthe day of the transaction. The standard\ncreation transaction fee is generally fixed at\nthe amount shown in the table below regardless\nof the number of Creation Units being\npurchased, but may be reduced by a Fund if\ntransfer and processing expenses associated\nwith the creation are anticipated to be lower\nthan the stated fee. If a purchase consists of\na cash portion, the Authorized Participant may\nalso be required to pay an additional\ntransaction charge (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) to cover brokerage and certain\nother costs related to the creation\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs). Authorized Participants\nwill also bear the costs of transferring the\nDeposit Securities to the Funds. Certain\nfees/costs associated with creation\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\neach Fund's standard creation transaction fee\nand maximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n                     Standard  Maximum        \n  Fund          CreationTran\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                          Fee  for            \n                               Creations*     \n  iShares                                     \n  Breakthrough                                \n  Environment\u2026           $925  7.0%           \n  Solutions                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Core                                \n  MSCI EAFE            15,000  7.0%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Core                                \n  MSCI                                        \n  Internation\u2026         17,500  7.0%           \n  Developed                                   \n  Markets ETF                                 \n  iShares Core                                \n  MSCI Total           15,000  7.0%           \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Stock ETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Cybersecuri\u2026            215  3.0%           \n  and Tech ETF                                \n  iShares                                     \n  Exponential           1,600  3.0%           \n  Technologies                                \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Future AI &           2,850  3.0%           \n  Tech ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Future Cloud            950  3.0%           \n  5G and Tech                                 \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Genomics                                    \n  Immunology              850  3.0%           \n  and                                         \n  Healthcare                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Global                7,000  7.0%           \n  Equity                                      \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI          7,800  7.0%           \n  ACWI ETF                                    \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  ACWI ex U.S.         11,700  7.0%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  ACWI Low              5,000  7.0%           \n  Carbon                                      \n  Target ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  All Country                                 \n  Asia ex               4,500  7.0%           \n  Japan                                       \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI          7,150  7.0%           \n  China A ETF                                 \n  iShares                                     \n  Neuroscience                                \n  and                     350  7.0%           \n  Healthcare                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Self-Driving          3,375  3.0%           \n  EV and Tech                                 \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Virtual Work                                \n  and Life                550  7.0%           \n  Multisector                                 \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. If a purchase consists of a\ncash portion and each Fund places a brokerage\ntransaction to purchase portfolio securities\nwith the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the\nAuthorized Participant may be required, in its\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nRedemption of Creation Units. Shares of a Fund\nmay be redeemed by Authorized Participants\nonly in Creation Units at their NAV next\ndetermined after receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form by the Distributor or\nits agent and only on a Business Day. The\nFunds will not redeem shares in amounts less\nthan Creation Units. There can be no\nassurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. The iShares MSCI China A ETF\ngenerally redeems Creation Units solely for\ncash (which may include the currency in which\nthe underlying securities are denominated).\nHowever, the iShares MSCI China A ETF reserves\nthe right to distribute securities in-kind as\npayment for Creation Units being redeemed. All\nother Funds discussed in this SAI generally\nredeem Creation Units\n\n120\n\npartially for cash. Please see the Cash\nRedemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Funds. Each Fund\npublishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of a\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nWhen redemptions are permitted in-kind, Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for a\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The iShares MSCI China\nA ETF generally redeems Creation Units for\ncash. All other Funds discussed in this SAI\ngenerally redeem Creation Units partially for\ncash. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion,\nprovide such redeeming Authorized Participant\na portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Fund Securities,\nbut does not differ in NAV. The Redemption\nBasket may also be modified to minimize the\nCash Component by redistributing the cash to\nthe Fund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds or for the iShares MSCI\nChina A ETF that is normally redeemed on a\ncash basis only, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified ( e.g., Creation Units of the\niShares MSCI China A ETF are generally\nredeemed solely for cash, while Creation Units\nof all other Funds in this SAI are generally\nredeemed partially for cash or where the\nmarket for individual securities does not\npermit in-kind redemption), they will be\neffected in essentially the same manner as in-\nkind redemptions thereof. In the case of\npartial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities and other\ninstruments it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The\nAuthorized Participant will also be required\nto pay certain transaction fees and charges\nfor cash redemptions, as described below, and,\nif transacting as broker with each Fund, may\nbe required to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Cash\nredemption proceeds will be paid to the\nAuthorized Participant redeeming shares as\nsoon as practicable after the date of\nredemption or within seven calendar days\nthereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a\ncash basis and an Authorized Participant has\nentered into an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, but the Authorized Participant is\nunable, as determined by BFA in its sole\ndiscretion, to execute the market transactions\nthat are the subject of the Execution\nPerformance Guarantee due to an extended\nmarket holiday that goes over seven calendar\ndays or in certain other situations where all\nor a portion of the transactions are unable to\nbe executed within seven calendar days, then\nthe Fund may pay the full amount of the\nredemption order (or the remaining amount of\nthe redemption order based on the unexecuted\nportion of the transaction)\n\n121\n\nwithin the original seven calendar day period\nby using the Fund\u2019s overdraft facility, line\nof credit or cash on hand. The Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer), acting on an agency basis,\nwill subsequently enter into one or more\nseparate market transactions when the markets\nreopen or the trades are otherwise able to be\nexecuted through which a Fund sells the Fund\nSecurities (or the remaining unsold Fund\nSecurities) subject to a guaranteed sales\nprice. If the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer)\nachieves executions in market transactions at\na price more favorable than a Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the Fund Securities as of the NAV\ncalculation applicable on the date of the\nredemption, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the excess transaction\nproceeds. Specifically, if the Authorized\nParticipant is unable to achieve executions in\nmarket transactions at a price at least equal\nto the Fund\u2019s valuation of the Fund Securities\nas of the NAV calculation applicable on the\ndate of the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is generally required to make the\napplicable shortfall payment to the Fund. In\naddition, if transacting as broker with a Fund\nin a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized\nParticipant may be required to cover foreign\nexchange costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If\nthe foreign exchange transaction associated\nwith the applicable security trades can only\noccur upon the settlement of a security trade\nand such trades are unable, as determined by\nBFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by\nthe seventh calendar day after receipt of the\nAuthorized Participant's redemption order,\nthen a Fund may pay within the original seven\ncalendar day period the amount due in respect\nof the redemption order based on the foreign\nexchange rate as of the date of the redemption\norder by using the Fund\u2019s overdraft facility,\nline of credit or cash on hand (in addition to\nany sales proceeds from the executed portion\nof the original brokerage order) and\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nforeign exchange transactions with the\nAuthorized Participant (or a broker-dealer\naffiliate of the Authorized Participant or a\nthird-party broker-dealer engaged through the\nAuthorized Participant), acting on an agency\nbasis, and be subject to a guaranteed sales\nprice. If the Authorized Participant achieves\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price more favorable than the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds. If the\nAuthorized Participant is unable to achieve\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price at least equal to the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant is required to make\nthe applicable shortfall payment to the Fund.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer, processing and\nother transaction costs that may be incurred\nby the relevant Fund. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee is charged on each Creation\nUnit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on\nthe day of the transaction. The standard\nredemption transaction fee is generally fixed\nat the amount shown in the table below\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, but may be reduced by each\nFund if transfer and processing expenses\nassociated with the redemption are anticipated\nto be lower than the stated fee. If a\nredemption consists of a cash portion, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\npay an additional transaction charge (up to\nthe maximum amount shown below) to cover\nbrokerage and certain other costs related to\nthe redemption transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs). Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from a Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services.

If a redemption\nconsists of a cash portion and each Fund\nplaces a brokerage transaction to sell\nportfolio securities with the Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer), the Authorized Participant may\nbe required, in its capacity as broker-dealer\nwith respect to that transaction, to cover\ncertain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,\nexecution, and price movement costs through an\nExecution Performance Guarantee, as described\nin the Brokerage Transactions section of this\nSAI. Placement of Redemption Orders.\nRedemption requests for Creation Units of the\nFunds must be submitted to the Distributor or\nits agent by or through an Authorized\nParticipant. An Authorized Participant must\nsubmit an irrevocable request to redeem shares\nof a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime on any Business Day in order to receive\nthat day's NAV. On days when the Listing\nExchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund\nmay require orders to redeem Creation Units to\nbe placed earlier that day. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a redemption\nrequest to be made through an Authorized\nParticipant. The Distributor or its agent will\nprovide a list of current Authorized\nParticipants upon request. The Authorized\nParticipant must transmit the request for\nredemption in the form required by the Funds\nto the Distributor or its agent in accordance\nwith procedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not\nhave executed an Authorized Participant\nAgreement and that, therefore, requests to\nredeem Creation Units may have to be placed by\nthe investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant who has executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. At any time, only a\nlimited number of broker-dealers will have an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement in effect.\nInvestors making a redemption request should\nbe aware that such request must be in the form\nspecified by such Authorized Participant.\nInvestors making a request to redeem Creation\nUnits should allow sufficient time to permit\nproper submission of the request by an\nAuthorized Participant and transfer of the\nshares to the Funds' transfer agent; such\ninvestors should allow for the additional time\nthat may be required to effect redemptions\nthrough their banks, brokers or other\nfinancial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant on\nbehalf of itself or another redeeming investor\nwithin the time periods specified above; and\n(iii) all other procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement are properly\nfollowed. Upon receiving a redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent shall notify the\napplicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent\nof such redemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\n\n123\n\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. For the iShares MSCI China\nA ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are\ngenerally made within one Business Day ( i.e.\n, \u201c T+1 \u201d ). For the iShares Breakthrough\nEnvironmental Solutions ETF, iShares Core MSCI\nEAFE ETF, iShares Core MSCI International\nDeveloped Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI Total\nInternational Stock ETF, iShares Cybersecurity\nand Tech ETF, iShares Exponential Technologies\nETF, iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF, iShares Genomics\nImmunology and Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ETF,\niShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares MSCI\nACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, iShares MSCI All\nCountry Asia ex Japan ETF, iShares\nNeuroscience and Healthcare ETF, iShares Self-\nDriving EV and Tech ETF and iShares Virtual\nWork and Life Multisector ETF, deliveries of\nredemption proceeds are generally made within\ntwo Business Days ( i.e. , \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\neach Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a basis other than\nT+1 or T+2, including a shorter settlement\nperiod, if necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, each Fund reserves the right\nto settle redemption transactions on a basis\nother than T+1 or T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and\ndividend ex-dates ( i.e. , the last date the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity sold) and in certain other\ncircumstances consistent with applicable law.\nIf neither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the relevant Fund next determined after\nthe redemption request is received in proper\nform (minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Trust's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and each Fund (whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Fund cannot lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or cannot do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. Although the Trust does not ordinarily\npermit cash redemptions of Creation Units\n(except that, as noted above, Creation Units\nof each Fund generally will be redeemed\npartially for cash, with the exception of\nCreation Units for the iShares MSCI China A\nETF, which generally will be redeemed for\ncash), in the event that cash redemptions are\npermitted or required by the Trust, proceeds\nwill be paid to the Authorized Participant\nredeeming shares as soon as practicable after\nthe date of redemption within seven calendar\ndays thereafter. If a Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\u2019s\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or\nprior to the time specified by a Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby State Street and marked-to-market daily.\nThe fees of State Street and any sub-\ncustodians in respect of the delivery,\nmaintenance and redelivery of the collateral\nshall be payable by the Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement permits the Funds to acquire shares\nof the Funds at any time and subjects the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the aggregate of the cost to\nthe Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the\nvalue of the Cash Amount, and the value of the\ncollateral together with liability for related\nbrokerage and other charges.\n\n124\n\nBecause the portfolio securities of a Fund may\ntrade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing\nExchange is closed or are otherwise not\nBusiness Days for such Fund, shareholders may\nnot be able to redeem their shares of such\nFund or purchase or sell shares of such Fund\non the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV\nof such Fund could be significantly affected\nby events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nany Fund: (i) for any period during which the\napplicable Listing Exchange is closed (other\nthan customary weekend and holiday closings);\n(ii) for any period during which trading on\nthe applicable Listing Exchange is suspended\nor restricted; (iii) for any period during\nwhich an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for each Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\n125\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of each\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A\nFund will be subject to income tax at regular\ncorporate rates on any taxable income or gains\nthat it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income\n\n126\n\nor gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. A Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards as\nset forth in the table below as of July 31,\n2023, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:\n                                              \n  Fund                  Non-Expiring Capital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares Core MSCI           $2,851,726,162  \n  EAFE ETF                                    \n  iShares Core MSCI                           \n  International                  210,120,034  \n  Developed Markets                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Core MSCI                           \n  Total International          1,399,588,738  \n  Stock ETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Cybersecurity and               46,277,332  \n  Tech ETF                                    \n  iShares Exponential             34,675,999  \n  Technologies ETF                            \n  iShares Future AI &             62,816,894  \n  Tech ETF                                    \n  iShares Future Cloud               613,248  \n  5G and Tech ETF                             \n  iShares Genomics                            \n  Immunology and                  74,880,768  \n  Healthcare ETF                              \n  iShares Global                   9,276,181  \n  Equity Factor ETF                           \n  iShares MSCI ACWI            1,089,461,508  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI ACWI ex           565,379,041  \n  U.S. ETF                                    \n  iShares MSCI ACWI                           \n  Low Carbon Target               76,822,624  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI All                            \n  Country Asia ex                890,673,987  \n  Japan ETF                                   \n  iShares MSCI China A           113,808,609  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Neuroscience                59,252  \n  and Healthcare ETF                          \n  iShares Self-Driving            88,412,872  \n  EV and Tech ETF                             \n  iShares Virtual Work                        \n  and Life Multisector             1,676,647  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by a Fund in\nOctober, November or December of any calendar\nyear and payable to shareholders of record on\na specified date in such a month shall be\ndeemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if a Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital\n\n127\n\ngains in a notice to its shareholders who (a)\nwill be required to include in income for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, as long-term\ncapital gains, their proportionate shares of\nthe undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled\nto credit their proportionate shares of the\ntax paid by the Fund on the undistributed\namount against their U.S. federal income tax\nliabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to\nthe extent their credits exceed their\nliabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled\nto increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, in their shares by an\namount equal to the excess of the amount in\nclause (a) over the amount in clause (b).\nOrganizations or persons not subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such capital gains will\nbe entitled to a refund of their pro rata\nshare of such taxes paid by the Fund upon\nfiling appropriate returns or claims for\nrefund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Long-term capital gains\nare eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of\n15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).\nDistributions in excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof a Fund\u2019s earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of capital.\nShareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, a Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, a Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder\nwill realize a taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nthe shareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund.\nA redemption of shares by a Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets\n\n128\n\nin the shareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the shares are\nheld for more than one year and short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor one year or less. Any loss realized on a\nsale or exchange will be disallowed to the\nextent the shares disposed of are replaced,\nincluding replacement through the reinvesting\nof dividends or capital gains distributions,\nor by an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of each Fund, has the right to reject\nan order for a purchase of shares of the Fund\nif the purchaser (or group of purchasers)\nwould, upon obtaining the shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a\ngiven Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351\nand 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that\nFund would have a basis in the securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s\nbasis in such securities on the date of\ndeposit was less than market value on such\ndate, the Fund, upon disposition of the\nsecurities, would recognize more taxable gain\nor less taxable loss than if its basis in the\nsecurities had been equal to market value. It\nis not anticipated that the Trust will\nexercise the right of rejection except in a\ncase where the Trust determines that accepting\nthe order could result in material adverse tax\nconsequences to a Fund or its shareholders.\nThe Trust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. Taxation of Certain\nDerivatives. A Fund\u2019s transactions in zero\ncoupon securities, non-U.S. currencies,\nforward contracts, options and futures\ncontracts (including options and futures\ncontracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the\nextent permitted, will be subject to special\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to \u201c hedging\ntransactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d ) that, among\nother consequences, may affect the character\nof gains and losses realized by the Fund (\ni.e. , may affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.\nThese rules could therefore affect the\ncharacter, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also (a)\nwill require a Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of the positions in its portfolio ( i.e.\n, treat them as if they were closed out at the\nend of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of a Fund as a RIC. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in so-called \u201c Section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All Section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in a\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\n\n129\n\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, a Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund of investment\ncompany taxable income (including any short-\nterm capital gains), whether received in cash\nor shares, will be taxable either as ordinary\nincome or as qualified dividend income, which\nis eligible to be taxed at long-term capital\ngain rates to the extent a Fund receives\nqualified dividend income on the securities it\nholds and a Fund reports the distribution as\nqualified dividend income. Qualified dividend\nincome is, in general, dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations (but generally not\nfrom U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S.\ncorporations ( e.g. , non-U.S. corporations\nthat are not PFICs and which are incorporated\nin a possession of the U.S. or in certain\ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with\nthe U.S., or the stock of which is readily\ntradable on an established securities market\nin the U.S. (where the dividends are paid with\nrespect to such stock)). Under current IRS\nguidance, the U.S. has appropriate\ncomprehensive income tax treaties with the\nfollowing countries: Australia, Austria,\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,\nCanada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which\nis treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S.\ntax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\nDenmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France,\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India,\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nRussia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom a Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir respective tax-exempt shareholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt\nshareholder could realize UBTI by virtue of\nits investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund\nconstitute debt-financed property in the hands\nof the\n\n130\n\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by a Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. A Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but a Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, a Fund\nmay not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require a Fund to forego\notherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nNon-U.S. Investments. Under Section 988 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, gains or losses\nattributable to fluctuations in exchange rates\nbetween the time a Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime a Fund actually collects such income or\npays such liabilities are generally treated as\nordinary income or ordinary loss. In general,\ngains (and losses) realized on debt\ninstruments will be treated as Section 988\ngain (or loss) to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts and certain\nnon-U.S. currency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless a Fund were to\nelect otherwise. Each Fund may be subject to\nnon-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source.\nEach Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to\n\u201c pass through \u201d to its investors the amount\nof non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund\nprovided that the Fund held the security on\nthe dividend settlement date and for at least\n15 additional days immediately before and/or\nthereafter, with the result that each investor\nwith respect to shares of the Fund held for a\nminimum 16-day holding period at the time of\ndeemed distribution will (i) include in gross\nincome, even though not actually received, the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct\n(in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only\nfor investors who itemize their deductions on\ntheir personal tax returns) or credit (in\ncalculating U.S. federal income tax) the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on\ndividends on non-U.S. securities while such\nsecurities are lent out by a Fund are not\neligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.\nTaxes not \u201c passed through \u201d for tax purposes\nwill not be available to shareholders for\nforeign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person\ninvested in the Fund in a year that the Fund\nelects to \u201c pass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes\nmay be treated as receiving additional\ndividend income subject to U.S. withholding\ntax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of a Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Certain of the Funds have filed\nrefund claims in various EU countries to\nrecover taxes withheld on dividend income\nreceived during past years based upon certain\nprovisions in the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union. Whether or when a Fund\nwill receive a tax refund is within the\ncontrol of the individual country. Pending\nconfirmatory guidance from the IRS, the\nrefunds received may reduce the Fund\u2019s pass-\nthrough of foreign tax credits in such year\nand potentially future years or may result in\nthe Funds paying an IRS compliance fee to\ncover the effect of the tax credits previously\npassed through to shareholders on refunded\nforeign taxes.\n\n131\n\nPassive Foreign Investment Companies. If a\nFund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a\nFund might be required to include in income\neach year a portion of the ordinary earnings\nand net capital gains of the qualified\nelecting fund, even if not distributed to a\nFund, and such amounts would be subject to the\n90% and excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, a Fund would be required to obtain\ncertain annual information from the PFICs in\nwhich it invests, which may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain. Alternatively, a Fund\nmay make a mark-to-market election that would\nresult in a Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, a Fund would\nreport any such gains as ordinary income and\nwould deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made,\nwould be effective for all subsequent taxable\nyears, unless revoked with the consent of the\nIRS. By making the election, a Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. A Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. A Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an\n\n132\n\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nat least 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. and the foreign shareholder\nwould be subject to withholding tax at a rate\nof 21% and would generally be required to file\na U.S. federal income tax return. Similar\nconsequences would generally apply to a\nforeign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund\nshares unless the Fund is domestically\ncontrolled (meaning that more than 50% of the\nvalue of the Fund's shares is held by U.S.\nshareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns\nno more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any\ntime during the five-year period ending on the\ndate of sale. Finally, a domestically\ncontrolled Fund may be required to recognize a\nportion of its gain on the in-kind\ndistribution of certain U.S. real property\ninterests. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund. The rules laid out in\nthe previous two paragraphs, other than the\nwithholding rules, will apply notwithstanding\ncertain of the Funds' participation in a wash\nsale transaction or its payment of a\nsubstitute dividend. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in a Fund. Separately, a\n30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of a Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

The\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\n( \u201c AIFMD \u201d ) imposes detailed and\nprescriptive obligations on fund managers\nestablished in the EU ( \u201c EU Operative\nProvisions \u201d ). These do not currently apply\nto managers established outside of the EU,\nsuch as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only\nrequired to comply with certain disclosure,\nreporting and transparency obligations of\nAIFMD ( \u201c AIFMD Disclosure Provisions \u201d ) if\nsuch managers market a fund to EU investors.\nWhere the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate\nto EU Operative Provisions that do not apply\nto BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made.\nThese EU Operative Provisions include\nprescriptive rules on: measuring and capping\nleverage in line with known European\nstandards; the treatment of investors; the use\nof \u201c depositaries \u201d ; and coverage for\nprofessional liability risks. AIFMD imposes\ncertain conditions on the marketing of funds,\nsuch as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD\nrequires that an \u2018alternative investment fund\nmanager\u2019 ( \u201c AIFM \u201d ) be identified to meet\nsuch conditions where such marketing is\nsought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal\nentity responsible for performing the\nportfolio and risk management of the Funds,\nshall be the AIFM. AIFMD requires disclosure\non an ongoing basis of certain information\nrelating to the use of special arrangements,\nleverage, rights of reuse of collateral,\nguarantees granted under leverage arrangements\nand the use of gates, side pockets and similar\nliquidity management tools. Given that the\nFunds do not use any special arrangements or\nallow for collateral reuse, it is not intended\nthat such disclosures will need to be made by\nthe Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the\nextent relevant and appropriate, disclose in\nits annual report information on the Fund's\nleverage, risk profile and risk management\nsystems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also\ndisclose material changes, if any, to the\nliquidity management systems and procedures\nemployed in respect of the Fund. BFA has\nregistered the following Funds for marketing\nto investors in the respective countries\nlisted below: \u2022 iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF:\nthe U.K. \u2022 iShares MSCI ACWI ETF: Finland, the\nNetherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. \u2022 iShares\nMSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF: the\nNetherlands Investors\u2019 Rights. Each Fund\nrelies on the services of BFA and its other\nservice providers, including the Distributor,\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent.\nFurther information about the duties and roles\nof these service providers is set out in this\nSAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund\nare not parties to the relevant agreement with\nthese service providers and do not have\nexpress contractual rights against the Fund or\nits service providers, except certain\ninstitutional investors that are Authorized\nParticipants may have certain express\ncontractual rights with respect to the\nDistributor under the terms of the\n\n134\n\nrelevant Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors may have certain legal rights under\nfederal or state law against a Fund or its\nservice providers. In the event that an\ninvestor considers that it may have a claim\nagainst a Fund, or against any service\nprovider in connection with its investment in\na Fund, such investor should consult its own\nlegal advisor. By contract, Authorized\nParticipants irrevocably submit to the non-\nexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State\nor U.S. federal court sitting in New York City\nover any suit, action or proceeding arising\nout of or relating to the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Jurisdiction over other\nclaims, whether by investors or Authorized\nParticipants, will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case and the law of the\njurisdiction in which the proceeding is\nbrought.\n\n135\n\nAppendix A - iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies Open-End Fund Proxy Voting Policy\nProcedures Governing Delegation of Proxy\nVoting to Fund Advisers Effective Date: August\n1, 2021 Last Review Date: August 25, 2023\nOpen-End Mutual Funds (including money market\nfunds) Exchange-Traded Funds Objective and\nScope Set forth below is the Open-End Fund\nProxy Voting Policy. Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements. BlackRock has adopted guidelines\nand procedures (together and as from time to\ntime amended, the \u201c BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\naccounts managed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\ncast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on\nspecific proxy issues in respect of securities\nheld by each such Fund (or may refrain from\nvoting) in accordance with the BlackRock proxy\nvoting guidelines. BlackRock will report on an\nannual basis to the Directors on (1) a summary\nof the proxy voting process as applicable to\nthe Funds in the preceding year together with\na representation that all votes were in\naccordance with the BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines, and (2) any changes to the\nBlackRock proxy voting guidelines that have\nnot previously been reported.\n\nA-1\n\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship Global\nPrinciples Effective as of January 2024\nBlackRock\n\nA-2\n                                              \n  Contents                                    \n  Introduction to BlackRock             A-4   \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship  A-4   \n  Shareholder rights                    A-4   \n  Key themes                            A-4   \n  Boards and directors                  A-5   \n  Auditors and audit-related issues     A-7   \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other                      A-8   \n  special transactions                        \n  Executive compensation                A-8   \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                             A-9   \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                       A-11  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                 A-11  \n  BlackRock\u2019s oversight of its                \n  investment                            A-12  \n  stewardship activities                      \n  Vote execution                        A-12  \n  Voting Choice                         A-13  \n  Conflicts management policies and     A-13  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                    A-14  \n  Voting guidelines                     A-14  \n  Reporting and vote transparency       A-15  \n                                              \nThe purpose of this document is to provide an\noverarching explanation of BlackRock\u2019s\napproach globally to our responsibilities as a\nshareholder on behalf of our clients, our\nexpectations of companies, and our commitments\nto clients in terms of our own governance and\ntransparency.\n\nA-3\n\nIntroduction to BlackRock BlackRock\u2019s purpose\nis to help more and more people experience\nfinancial well-being. We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-07e-0824\n"
