Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings.\nPowered by artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d),\ninformation technology stocks led the market\nfor most of the reporting period. However,\nmarket sentiment pivoted toward more defensive\nsectors late in the reporting period amid\ngrowing uncertainty surrounding economic\ngrowth, geopolitics, and the upcoming U.S.\npresidential election. In Germany, the\neurozone\u2019s largest economy, growth shrunk\nduring the reporting period, as stagnating\neconomic conditions continued. In France, snap\nParliamentary elections and uncertainty\nsurrounding both parties\u2019 plans to reduce the\ndeficit caused volatility. What contributed to\nperformance? German stocks contributed the\nmost to the Fund\u2019s performance during the\nreporting period, led by the information\ntechnology sector. Enthusiasm over AI,\nincreased spending on cybersecurity and cloud\ncomputing, and ongoing digitalization efforts\nboosted the sector, most notably within the\nsoftware and services industry. The German\nfinancials sector also contributed to\nperformance, led by insurance companies.\nStocks in the Netherlands benefited returns,\nmost notably in the semiconductors and\nsemiconductor equipment industry within the\ninformation technology sector. Despite fears\nof potential export restrictions to China, the\nstock of Europe\u2019s largest technology firm that\nmanufactures the machines used to build\ncomputer chips continued to rise. What\ndetracted from performance? During the\nreporting period, stocks in Ireland detracted\nfrom the Fund\u2019s performance, most notably in\nthe materials sector. The stock of a provider\nof building materials solutions declined after\nit transitioned its primary listing to the New\nYork Stock Exchange, causing frustration among\nsome shareholders.

Bolstered\nby solid corporate earnings and a weak yen,\nJapanese equities registered solid gains\nduring the reporting period. Helping the\ncountry\u2019s economic growth was accelerating\ninflation, robust consumption, better-than-\nexpected industrial production, and tight\nlabor conditions. After 17 years, Japan\u2019s\ncentral bank finally ended its negative\ninterest-rate policy during the reporting\nperiod and indicated that more rate hikes\nwould be forthcoming as long as inflation\nremained on target. The yen\u2019s continued\nweakness and volatility prompted the Bank of\nJapan to intervene. A surprise rate hike late\nin the reporting period caused a sharp but\nbrief plunge in global equity markets. What\ncontributed to performance? The financials\nsector was the largest contributor to the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period. The\ncountry\u2019s banking sector gained as the Bank of\nJapan ended its multi-year zero interest rate\npolicy. The central bank raised rates and\nreduced its bond buying as it attempted to\nnormalize monetary policy, boosting the net\nincome interest (the difference between the\nrates banks charge for loans and the rates\nthey pay for deposits) of Japanese banks.\nInsurance companies also gained on the higher\nrate regime and anticipated growth. The\nindustrials sector was another source of\ngrowth for the Fund, helped by the performance\nof trading companies and industrial\nconglomerates. These firms play a vital role\nin Japan\u2019s economy, operating across various\nsectors, including commodities, energy,\nmetals, chemicals, consumer goods, logistics,\nand finance. Information technology stocks\nalso contributed to the Fund\u2019s return, helped\nby solid performance from technology hardware\nand semiconductor firms. What detracted from\nperformance? During the reporting period,\nthere were no material detractors from the\nFund\u2019s return.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\nBank provided strong indications that it would\nsoon lower interest rates while the Bank of\nJapan exited its zero-interest rate policy\nthat it had held since 2016. During the\nreporting period, the United States government\nannounced it would allocate $1 billion in\nCommodity Credit Corporation funding for\nemergency international food assistance. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nUnited States were the leading contributors to\nthe Fund\u2019s return. Within the materials\nsector, companies providing containers and\npackaging gained on strategic initiatives,\nrising demand, and easing input costs. These\ncompanies, which produce paper products, also\ngained due to a shift away from single-use\nplastic packaging. Specialty chemicals stocks\ncontributed on cutting-edge technology and\nartificial intelligence driven solutions for\ntheir food service offerings. What detracted\nfrom performance? Stocks in Germany detracted\nthe most from the Fund\u2019s performance during\nthe reporting period. In the healthcare\nsector, a major pharmaceutical company faced\nincreasing negative pressures due to\nlitigation from one of its subsidiaries. The\nfirm was forced to cut its dividend in an\nattempt to reconcile its large debt burden.\nThe views expressed reflect the opinions of\nBlackRock as of the date of this report and\nare subject to change based on changes in\nmarket, economic or other conditions.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\nBank provided strong indications that it would\nsoon lower interest rates. Inflows into\nenvironmental, sustainable, and governance\n(\u201cESG\u201d) funds varied by region during the\nreporting period. What contributed to\nperformance? During the reporting period,\nJapanese stocks contributed the most to the\nFund\u2019s return, led by the diversified banking\nindustry within the financials sector.\nFollowing the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to\nraise rates and corporate governance reforms,\nJapanese banks generated higher returns on\ntheir large reserve balances. Stocks in Europe\nalso contributed to performance, most notably\nin Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany.\nThe Swiss healthcare sector benefited from the\nstrength of a top pharmaceutical company that\nspun off its generic division, while\nsemiconductor materials and equipment\ncompanies in the Netherlands benefited from\nartificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) enthusiasm. In\nGermany, the information technology sector\nalso strongly contributed to performance, led\nby software and services companies that\nleverage cloud computing and AI. What\ndetracted from performance? Amid slowing\ngrowth in the region, stocks in Hong Kong\ndetracted from the Fund\u2019s return during the\nreporting period, led by the financials\nsector. The stock of a large insurance company\nsold off as investors fear continued\nuncertainty in China\u2019s economy will impact the\ncompany\u2019s ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase shares.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but weakening growth in China and a\nstronger U.S. dollar weighed on equities.\nOverall, stocks registered solid gains as\ninvestor confidence increased due to several\ncentral banks cutting interest rates, a\nslowdown in pricing pressures, and robust\ncorporate earnings. What contributed to\nperformance? Indian stocks contributed the\nmost to the Fund\u2019s return during the reporting\nperiod, led by the consumer discretionary and\ninformation technology sectors. Several Indian\ninformation technology consultancy firms have\npartnered with large global technology\ncompanies to use artificial intelligence\n(\u201cAI\u201d) to optimize and modernize their service\nofferings. Among automakers, new product\nlaunches and strong order books drove positive\nreturns. Stocks in Taiwan also contributed to\nperformance, most notably in the information\ntechnology sector. Companies that manufacture\nthe advanced semiconductor chips necessary to\npower AI continued to see strong demand from\nglobal technology companies, and the world\u2019s\nbiggest chipmaker is based in Taiwan. What\ndetracted from performance? Amid a slowing\neconomy, Chinese stocks detracted meaningfully\nfrom the Fund\u2019s performance during the\nreporting period, led by the consumer\ndiscretionary sector. Chinese broadline retail\ncompanies suffered as consumer spending\ndecreased while competition within the\ne-commerce space increased.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to easing monetary policy, a\nslowdown in pricing pressures, and robust\ncorporate earnings. The European Central Bank\ncut its primary lending rate in June, and the\nU.S. Federal Reserve Bank provided strong\nindications that it would soon lower interest\nrates. Conversely, the Bank of Japan exited\nits zero-interest rate policy that it had held\nsince 2016. Inflows into environmental,\nsustainable, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) funds\nvaried by region during the reporting period.\nWhat contributed to performance? During the\nreporting period, Japanese stocks contributed\nthe most to the Fund\u2019s return, led by the\ndiversified banking industry within the\nfinancials sector. Following the Bank of\nJapan\u2019s decision to raise rates and corporate\ngovernance reforms, Japanese banks generated\nhigher returns on their large reserve\nbalances. Stocks in Europe also contributed to\nperformance, most notably in the United\nKingdom and Switzerland. While the Swiss\nhealthcare sector benefited from the strength\nof a top pharmaceutical company that spun off\nits generic division, strong earnings and\nample liquidity supported a rise in valuations\nfor most major U.K. banks in the financials\nsector. What detracted from performance? Amid\nslowing growth in the region, stocks in Hong\nKong detracted from the Fund\u2019s return during\nthe reporting period, led by the financials\nsector. The stock of a large insurance company\nsold off as investors fear continued\nuncertainty in China\u2019s economy will impact the\ncompany\u2019s ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase shares.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but weakening growth in China and a\nstronger U.S. dollar weighed on equities.\nPowered by artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d),\ninformation technology stocks led the market\nfor most of the reporting period. However,\nmarket sentiment pivoted toward more defensive\nsectors late in the reporting period amid\ngrowing uncertainty surrounding economic\ngrowth, geopolitics, and the upcoming U.S.\npresidential election. Inflows into\nenvironmental, sustainable, and governance\n(\u201cESG\u201d) funds varied by region during the\nreporting period. Investors in Europe\ncontinued to show a growing interest in\nsustainable themes. What contributed to\nperformance? Companies in India were the\nlargest contributors to the Fund\u2019s return\nduring the reporting period. In the consumer\ndiscretionary sector, automobile manufacturers\ngained on new product launches and strong\ndemand. Volume gains for two-wheeler vehicles\nbenefited motorcycle manufacturers. Taiwanese\nstocks were also strong contributors to the\nFund\u2019s return, particularly among\nsemiconductor and semiconductor equipment\ncompanies. These firms produce advanced chips\nfor AI applications. What detracted from\nperformance? Companies in China were the\nlargest detractors from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Automobile firms within the\nconsumer discretionary sector were negatively\npressured by tariffs on electric vehicles\nmanufactured in China. Additionally, in the\nhealthcare sector, the Chinese government\u2019s\ncrackdown on corruption weighed on hospitals,\nthe pharmaceutical industry, and insurance\nfunds. Within life sciences tools and\nservices, several firms fell as U.S. lawmakers\nconsidered a bill that would prevent federal\nagencies from contracting with biotechnology\ncompanies that are associated with foreign\nadversaries.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. Overall, stocks\nregistered solid gains as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nBrazilian stock market underperformed other\nemerging markets over the reporting period,\ninfluenced by a combination of economic,\npolitical, and global factors. Smaller\ncompanies were further impacted by high\ninterest rates and inflation, which\nconstrained consumer spending and investment.\nWhat contributed to performance? The\nindustrials sector, which was the largest\nweighting of the Fund on average during the\nreporting period, contributed the most to the\nFund\u2019s performance, led by aerospace and\ndefense stocks. Specifically, an aerospace\ncompany benefited from an uptick in new plane\norders and optimism for future growth. What\ndetracted from performance? The consumer\ndiscretionary sector, which was the second\nhighest weighting of the Fund on average\nduring the reporting period, was the largest\ndetractor from the Fund\u2019s return. Education\nservices companies were hampered by\nintensified competition as several new startup\neducational technology companies entered the\nmarket. In consumer durables, homebuilding\nstocks detracted amid a higher interest rate\nenvironment. The healthcare sector also\ndetracted from the Fund\u2019s performance, as\nhospitals and companies that provide\nhealthcare services came under negative\npressure. In the materials sector, steel\ncompanies suffered from low demand and rising\nimports.

China\u2019s\neconomic struggles continued during the\nreporting period, exacerbated by a prolonged\ndownturn in the property market. Sluggish\ndomestic demand has led to deflation and\nreduced growth prospects, prompting the\nChinese government to introduce stimulus\npackages. The major policy interventions\nenacted by the government helped to ease\ninvestor concerns, but sentiment remained\ncautious. The threat of increasing policy\ntariffs on Chinese imports further\ndeteriorated the economic growth landscape as\nCanada joined the United States, the European\nUnion, and other countries that have imposed\nsanctions on Chinese imports. What contributed\nto performance? In the financials sector,\nChina\u2019s state-owned diversified banks are some\nof the largest in the world. During the\nreporting period, banks contributed to the\nFund\u2019s return due to government measures to\nstimulate the economy. This included lowering\nbank reserves, which allowed the banks to\nincrease their lending activities. The\ncommunications sector also contributed,\nparticularly among interactive media and\nservices firms. Greater usage of social media,\nincreased sales in the gaming sector, and\nexcitement about new online games helped fuel\nthe performance of a major internet and\ntechnology company. What detracted from\nperformance? In the consumer discretionary\nsector, automobile stocks were among the\nlargest detractors from the Fund\u2019s return.\nStocks of electric vehicle makers fell sharply\ndue to increased tariffs on Chinese imports,\nand fears grew that more countries would do\nthe same. Decreased consumer spending\nnegatively impacted consumer staples stocks,\nparticularly premier alcoholic beverage\nstocks. In the healthcare sector, news of the\nU.S. Biosecure Act negatively impacted Chinese\nbiotechnology firms. The bill would restrict\nU.S. companies from contracting with Chinese\nbiotech companies that are considered a threat\nto national security.

China\u2019s\neconomic struggles continued during the\nreporting period, exacerbated by a prolonged\ndownturn in the property market. Sluggish\ndomestic demand has led to deflation and\nreduced growth prospects, prompting the\nChinese government to introduce stimulus\npackages. The major policy interventions\nenacted by the government helped to ease\ninvestor concerns, but sentiment remained\ncautious. The threat of increasing policy\ntariffs on Chinese imports further\ndeteriorated the economic growth landscape as\nCanada joined the United States, the European\nUnion, and other countries that have imposed\nsanctions on Chinese imports. Stock markets\nwere further hampered by decreasing foreign\ninvestments, as investors with significant\npositions in Chinese stocks began pulling out\nof the market. What contributed to\nperformance? In the financials sector, a\ncredit-tech services company in the consumer\nfinance sector slightly contributed during the\nreporting period. In addition to benefiting\nfrom government actions to stimulate the\neconomy, the company reported better-than-\nexpected earnings, raised its dividend, and\ncontinued its share buyback program. What\ndetracted from performance? Communications\nstocks were the largest detractors from the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period,\nparticularly among interactive media and\nservices companies. Internet services firms\nfaced difficulties in their e-commerce\nplatforms amid weak consumption trends and\nincreasing competition. In the information\ntechnology sector, semiconductor and\nsemiconductor equipment stocks were hampered\nby disparaging political comments in the\nUnited States and increased tariff threats.\nSoftware applications firms also detracted\nfrom the Fund\u2019s return, even as some of the\nstrict regulations targeting the technology\nsector were eased.

What contributed\nto performance? Helped by oil, gas, and coal\nstocks, the energy sector contributed to the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period.\nChina\u2019s quest for energy security has seen the\ncountry stockpiling key resources, including\ncoal and oil, amid concerns about global\nsupply disruptions. This strategic stockpiling\nhas bolstered domestic production and\nconsumption of energy resources. Additionally,\ncoal demand in China grew significantly as\nusage grew in the electricity generation and\nindustrial sectors. What detracted from\nperformance? Stocks in the real estate sector\nwere the largest detractors from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the reporting period.\nChina\u2019s property sector has been beleaguered\nby failing property developers, falling\nproperty prices, and a reduction in new\nconstruction projects, all leading to a\nprolonged slowdown in real estate activity.\nThe consumer discretionary sector detracted\namid the country\u2019s economic downturn, as\nhotels, restaurants, and leisure companies\nfell victim to weaker consumer spending\nhabits. Companies in the healthcare sector\nwere negatively impacted by the Chinese\ngovernment\u2019s crackdown on corruption that\ntargeted hospitals, the pharmaceutical\nindustry, and insurance funds.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, as did Denmark\u2019s central bank;\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve Bank provided strong\nindications that it would soon lower interest\nrates. Conversely, the Bank of Japan exited\nits zero-interest rate policy that it had held\nsince 2016, raising its short-term policy rate\nand suggesting that more hikes would be\nforthcoming. With inflation continuing to cool\nand a recession likely in the rearview mirror,\nDenmark registered solid returns during the\nreporting period, driven predominately by the\nhealthcare sector. What contributed to\nperformance? Stocks in the healthcare sector\ncontributed the most to the Fund\u2019s performance\nduring the reporting period, led by the\npharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies benefited from strong demand for the\nGLP-1 drug therapies used to treat diabetes\nand obesity. Financial stocks also contributed\nto performance, particularly bank stocks, as\nhigher interest rates helped to boost net\nincome (the difference between what banks\nreceive from loans and what they pay on\ndeposits) and profit forecasts. What detracted\nfrom performance? Stocks in the consumer\nstaples sector detracted the most from the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period,\nmost notably in the beverages industry. The\nstock of a large Dutch brewer fell because of\ndeclining sales in its key Chinese market as\nconsumers moved away from premium alcohol\nbrands. Utilities stocks also detracted after\na renewable energy company pulled out of an\noffshore wind consortium.

The\nEuropean Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) cut its primary\nlending rate in June, and the U.S. Federal\nReserve Bank provided strong indications that\nit would soon lower interest rates. As a\nmember of the Eurozone, Finland\u2019s monetary\npolicy, including its policy rate, is\ndetermined by the ECB. The Finnish economy\ngradually moved away from recessionary\nconditions during the reporting period,\nallowing for modest returns in select sectors.\nHowever, consumer confidence and spending\nremained low as economic uncertainty\npersisted. What contributed to performance?\nStocks in the industrials sector contributed\nthe most to the Fund\u2019s performance during the\nreporting period, led by the capital goods\nindustry. Industrial machinery companies\nstrongly contributed to performance. Marine\nand port equipment makers saw increased order\ndemand, particularly in the U.S. as the\ncountry continues to move away from Chinese\ncompanies. Financial stocks also contributed\nto performance, most notably among diversified\nbanks. What detracted from performance? Stocks\nin the energy sector detracted the most from\nthe Fund\u2019s return during the reporting period.\nWithin the sector, an oil refining and\nrenewable diesel company detracted from\nperformance after it missed operating profit\nmargins and lowered forecasted sales margins\nfor its renewable products in 2024.

The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\nBank provided strong indications that it would\nsoon lower interest rates. Conversely, the\nBank of Japan exited its zero-interest rate\npolicy that it had held since 2016. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nFrench industrials sector contributed the most\nto the Fund\u2019s performance during the reporting\nperiod, led by a firm in the construction,\nmachinery, and heavy transportation equipment\nsegment. The company, whose mission is to\ndevelop and promote sustainable transportation\nsolutions, benefited from a deleveraging plan,\na multi-billion-dollar train order, and an\nupgrade by a credit ratings agency. In the\nUnited States, several biotechnology companies\nin the healthcare sector contributed to the\nFund\u2019s return, encouraged by new product\nofferings. What detracted from performance?\nChinese stocks were the largest detractors\nfrom the Fund\u2019s return during the reporting\nperiod. In the consumer discretionary sector,\nstocks of electric vehicle (\u201cEV\u201d) makers fell\nsharply due to increased tariffs on Chinese\nimports and fears that more countries would do\nthe same. In Belgium, stocks in the material\nsector detracted, led by the chemicals\nindustry. Reduced demand for EVs hampered\ncompanies that produce battery materials.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. Indonesia held its\ngeneral election during the reporting period\nand continued to embark on a path of\nprogressive democratic reforms. The election\nof former Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto as\npresident helped relieve some of the country\u2019s\npolitical uncertainty and improved investor\nsentiment. What contributed to performance?\nThe largest contribution to the Fund\u2019s return\nduring the reporting period was from the\nfinancials sector. The end of the country\u2019s\nloan classification forbearance policy, which\nextended loan payments for certain industries\nparticularly impacted by the pandemic,\npositively impacted diversified banks by\nreducing their credit risk. In the energy\nsector, performance was helped by companies\nthat operate in coal and consumable fuels.\nIndonesia is one of the world\u2019s leading coal\nexporters, accounting for nearly half of\nglobal production, and increasing usage of\nfossil fuels benefited the Fund\u2019s performance.\nWhat detracted from performance? The consumer\ndiscretionary sector detracted the most from\nthe Fund\u2019s return during the reporting period.\nBroadline retail companies suffered from an\nincreasingly competitive environment and as\nthe Indonesian government banned e-commerce\ntransactions on social media platforms, which\nwere bringing in an influx of foreign goods to\nthe country. Additionally, a sharp decline in\nauto sales negatively impacted auto and\ncomponent companies. While there have been\nincreasing exports of coal, prices have\ndropped, negatively impacting Indonesia\u2019s\nindustrials stocks that transport coal.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) cut its primary\nlending rate in June, and the U.S. Federal\nReserve Bank provided strong indications that\nit would soon lower interest rates. As a\nmember of the Eurozone, Ireland\u2019s monetary\npolicy, including its policy rate, is\ndetermined by the ECB. With the economy\nimproving due in part to cooling inflation,\nIreland registered solid returns during the\nreporting period, driven predominately by the\nconsumer discretionary sector. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nconsumer discretionary sector strongly\ncontributed to the Fund\u2019s return during the\nreporting period. Within the sector, the\nhotels, restaurants, and leisure industry\nadded to performance, as Irish online sports\nbetting and gambling operators continued to\nbenefit from the ongoing popularity of sports\nbetting in the U.S. Healthcare stocks also\ncontributed to performance, most notably\nwithin the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and\nlife sciences industry. Due in part to\ncompetitive tax rates, Ireland has become the\nlargest exporter of pharmaceuticals in the\nEuropean Union and a hub for both clinical\nresearch institutions and drug manufacturing\nfacilities, including the increasingly popular\nGLP-1 drugs that treat diabetes and obesity.\nWhat detracted from performance? Amid an\naffordability crisis in Ireland, stocks in the\nreal estate sector detracted from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the reporting period, most\nnotably among residential real estate\ninvestment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d).

Bolstered\nby solid corporate earnings and a weak yen,\nJapanese equities registered significant gains\nduring the reporting period. Helping the\ncountry\u2019s economic growth was accelerating\ninflation, better-than-expected industrial\nproduction, and tight labor conditions. As the\ncountry moved from deflation to inflation, the\nBank of Japan exited its zero-interest rate\npolicy that it had held since 2016, raising\nits short-term policy rate and suggesting that\nmore hikes would be forthcoming. What\ncontributed to performance? The financials\nsector was the largest contributor to the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period. The\ncountry\u2019s banking sector gained as the central\nbank raised rates and reduced its bond buying\nin an attempt to normalize monetary policy,\nboosting the net income interest (the\ndifference between the rates banks charge for\nloans and the rates they pay for deposits) of\nJapanese banks. Insurance companies also\ngained on the higher rate regime and\nanticipated growth. The industrials sector was\nanother source of growth for the Fund, helped\nby the performance of trading companies and\nindustrial conglomerates. These firms play a\nvital role in Japan\u2019s economy, operating\nacross various sectors, including commodities,\nenergy, metals, chemicals, consumer goods,\nlogistics, and finance. In the consumer\ndiscretionary sector, automobile manufacturers\nbenefited from a recovery from supply chain\ntroubles, price hikes, and a weak yen. Weak\ncurrencies can help firms gain market share\nwhen their goods are less expensive compared\nto goods priced in stronger currencies. What\ndetracted from performance? During the\nreporting period, healthcare stocks modestly\ndetracted from the Fund\u2019s return after a major\npharmaceutical firm lost patent protection on\nseveral of its best-selling drugs.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. The Middle East was\nnegatively impacted by cuts in oil production\nand falling energy prices and experienced\nsignificant volatility due to the ongoing war\nbetween Hamas and Israel. Given that Kuwait\u2019s\neconomy is petroleum-based, growth was\nimpacted by volatility in energy prices. While\nKuwait\u2019s stock market rose during the\nreporting period, the country was hampered by\nits dysfunctional political system. What\ncontributed to performance? The financials\nsector, which comprised approximately 63% of\nthe Fund\u2019s on average during the reporting\nperiod, was the largest contributor to the\nFund\u2019s performance. Increasing merger and\nacquisition activity and higher interest rates\nhave helped the performance of diversified\nbanks. Kuwaiti government policies aimed at\nencouraging foreign investment have increased\nconstruction activity and fueled demand,\nbenefiting firms in the real estate sector.\nWhat detracted from performance? Stocks in the\nmaterials sector slightly detracted from the\nFund\u2019s performance during the reporting\nperiod.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and New Zealand\u2019s central bank\nfollowed suit in August; the U.S. Federal\nReserve Bank provided strong indications that\nit would soon lower interest rates. Despite\nstarting the reporting period in a technical\nrecession, New Zealand posted positive returns\nas economic conditions slightly improved due\nin part to a tourism recovery. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nhealthcare sector strongly contributed to the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period, led\nby the healthcare equipment and services\nindustry. Within the industry, a leading\nmedical equipment manufacturer and distributor\nin the respiratory space saw its revenue rise\nas demand for its hospital consumables (masks,\nsurgical accessories, etc.) increased.\nUtilities stocks also contributed to\nperformance, most notably within the\nindependent power and renewable electricity\nproducers industry. After finalizing plans to\nbuild the world\u2019s first net zero carbon\nrefinery, the stock of New Zealand\u2019s largest\nelectricity generator and retailer rose during\nthe reporting period. What detracted from\nperformance? Stocks in the industrials sector\ndetracted from the Fund\u2019s performance during\nthe reporting period. Within the sector,\ncapital goods companies detracted the most,\nparticularly among building products\ncompanies, which suffered from materially\nweaker trading conditions in New Zealand\u2019s\nresidential sector. Consumer staples stocks\nalso detracted from performance.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\nBank provided strong indications that it would\nsoon lower interest rates. Conversely, the\nBank of Japan exited its zero-interest rate\npolicy that it had held since 2016, raising\nits short-term policy rate and suggesting that\nmore hikes would be forthcoming. While\nelevated inflation and high credit costs\nweighed on Norway\u2019s economy, economic\nconditions improved during the reporting\nperiod due in part to a weak krone and\nincreasing exports. What contributed to\nperformance? Stocks in the industrial sector\ncontributed the most to the Fund\u2019s performance\nduring the reporting period, led by the\ncapital goods industry. Notably, Norwegian\naerospace and defense companies contributed,\nwith defense spending increasing as countries\nsought to modernize their armed forces amid\nongoing global conflicts both in Europe and\nthe Middle East. Financials stocks also\ncontributed to the Fund\u2019s performance,\nparticularly among banks, as Norway\u2019s central\nbank continued to keep its key policy rate on\nhold at 4.5%. What detracted from performance?\nMaterials stocks detracted the most from the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period,\nmost notably among fertilizers and\nagricultural chemicals companies. Amid\ndeclining global prices of its fertilizer\nproducts and ongoing crop production\nchallenges, the stock of a major Norwegian\nchemical company declined. Stocks in the\nhealthcare sector also detracted during the\nreporting period.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. Overall, stocks\nregistered solid gains as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings.\nStocks in companies with exposure to Peru\nincreased substantially for the reporting\nperiod. While the country started off 2024 in\ncontraction territory, Peru\u2019s economy returned\nto growth later in the reporting period,\ndriven by household spending. What contributed\nto performance? Performance was led by the\nmaterials sector, specifically companies\nengaged in metals and mining. The price of\ncopper, which is Peru\u2019s leading export metal,\nhas been upwardly mobile due to its pivotal\nrole in renewable energy generation and\nelectric vehicles. Rising gold prices also\nbenefited the Fund\u2019s performance, as Peru is\nhome to several gold mines and is one of the\nworld\u2019s top producers of the metal. Materials\nstocks in Canada and the United Kingdom also\ncontributed to the Fund\u2019s performance, due to\nthe presence of metals and mining companies\nfrom both countries operating in Peru. What\ndetracted from performance? The energy sector\nslightly detracted from the Fund\u2019s performance\nduring the reporting period, as oil prices\ncame under increasing downward pricing\npressures.

Overall, stocks\nregistered solid gains as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings.\nWhile inflation remained a concern, the\nPhilippine central bank cut rates for the\nfirst time in four years as officials expected\npricing pressure to start trending downward.\nPhilippine stocks rose during the reporting\nperiod, helped by steady economic growth. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nindustrials sector contributed to the Fund\u2019s\nreturn during the reporting period. The stock\nprice of a Philippine-based developer and\nmanager of global port facilities was\nsupported by robust financial performance and\nstrategic acquisitions. In the financials\nsector, the performance of diversified banks\nbenefited returns. Higher consumer spending\nand business investment supported lending\ngrowth, while banks maintained solid capital\npositions and strong net interest (the\ndifference between the rates banks charge for\nloans and the rates they pay for deposits)\nmargins. Strong property demand and consumer\nactivity helped property developers in the\nreal estate sector. What detracted from\nperformance? The consumer discretionary sector\ndetracted from the Fund\u2019s performance during\nthe reporting period. Casino and gaming stocks\nwere negatively impacted by declining gaming\nrevenue. In the home improvement industry, the\nstock of a construction supplies retailer\ndeclined amid slowing sales and losses due to\na fire at one of its locations.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks, but weakening growth\nin China and a stronger U.S. dollar weighed on\nequities. The European Central Bank cut its\nprimary lending rate in June, and the U.S.\nFederal Reserve Bank provided strong\nindications that it would soon lower interest\nrates. While inflationary pressures eased,\nPoland\u2019s central bank left interest rates on\nhold. After stagnating in 2023, Poland\u2019s\neconomy was upwardly revised in 2024, helped\nby domestic demand, slowing inflation, and\nsubstantial public expenditures, benefiting\nPolish equities. Additionally, Poland began to\nreceive locked funds from the European Union\nafter implementing reforms to restore judicial\nindependence in the country. What contributed\nto performance? Financials stocks, which\ncomprised approximately 47% of the Fund on\naverage during the reporting period,\ncontributed the most to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Diversified banks benefited from\nPoland\u2019s economic recovery and improved\ninvestor sentiment. Additionally, interest\nrates remained high, boosting net interest\nincome (the difference between the rates banks\ncharge for loans and the rates they pay for\ndeposits) for banks. Also contributing to\nreturns were apparel and accessory retailers\nin the consumer discretionary sector, which\nrose despite inflationary pressures. These\nfirms benefited from strategic expansions,\nimproving consumer confidence, and retail\ndemand. What detracted from performance?\nDetracting from the Fund\u2019s return during the\nreporting period were stocks in the consumer\nstaples sector, particularly among food\nretailers. An increasingly competitive\nlandscape sparked a price war between\nsupermarket operators in Poland, negatively\nimpacting profits for these firms.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. The Middle East was\nnegatively impacted by cuts in oil production\nand falling energy prices and experienced\nsignificant volatility due to the ongoing war\nbetween Hamas and Israel. Qatar\u2019s stock market\ngained during the reporting period but\nunderperformed other emerging markets. What\ncontributed to performance? Financial stocks,\nwhich comprised approximately 55% of the Fund\non average during the reporting period,\ncontributed the most to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Diversified banks benefited from\nhigher interest rates, increased lending\nvolumes, stable margins, and higher fee\nincome. As one of the world\u2019s largest\nexporters of liquified natural gas, companies\nthat provide transport and drilling equipment\nin the energy sector benefited from the\ncountry\u2019s long-term strategic expansion plans.\nIn the industrials sector, transportation\ncompanies were positively impacted by an\nincrease in global trade and efforts to\ndiversify services. What detracted from\nperformance? A main detractor from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the reporting period was\nthe country\u2019s leading supplier of power\ngeneration and water salination in the\nutilities sector. The company reported a\nprofit drop and lower earnings. In healthcare,\nthe country\u2019s implementation of a value-added\ntax (VAT) is expected to impact the cost of\nhealthcare-related components and supplies.\nWhile healthcare supplies are typically\nexempt, the VAT may still increase operating\ncosts for healthcare providers.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. The Middle East was\nnegatively impacted by cuts in oil production\nand falling energy prices and experienced\nsignificant volatility due to the ongoing war\nbetween Hamas and Israel. During the reporting\nperiod, Saudi Arabia faced a complex set of\nchallenges, largely driven by fluctuations in\noil production and global economic trends. The\ncountry\u2019s economy is largely dependent on oil\nproduction and falling energy prices have\ncurtailed growth. What contributed to\nperformance? Companies in the financials\nsector contributed the most to the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the reporting period.\nDiversified banks benefited from increased net\ninterest income (the difference between the\nrates banks charge for loans and the rates\nthey pay for deposits). Additionally, the\nimplementation of Vision 2030, which seeks to\nreduce the country\u2019s dependency on oil,\nbrought about reforms in financial\nregulations, making the banking sector more\nattractive to foreign investors. What\ndetracted from performance? Chemicals firms in\nthe materials sector were among the biggest\ndetractors from the Fund\u2019s return during the\nreporting period. Companies involved in the\ncommodity chemicals, and fertilizers and\nagricultural chemicals industries suffered\nfrom falling petrochemical prices and slowing\nglobal growth. Amid weaker global demand and\nto stabilize oil prices, Saudi Arabia made\nvoluntary reductions in oil production. These\ncuts led to a decrease in oil revenue and\nnegatively affected companies across the\nenergy sector, including producers, refiners,\nand transporters.

The\ngrowing prospect of lower interest rates in\nthe United States helped the performance of\nemerging market stocks during the reporting\nperiod, but geopolitical concerns, weakening\ngrowth in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar\nweighed on equities. The Middle East was\nnegatively impacted by cuts in oil production\nand falling energy prices and experienced\nsignificant volatility due to the ongoing war\nbetween Hamas and Israel. The United Arab\nEmirates (\u201cUAE\u201d) is one of the world\u2019s ten\nlargest oil producers, and its economy is\nhighly dependent on oil and natural gas\nexports. However, the country is seeking to\nbecome less oil-dependent, and non-oil gross\ndomestic product has significantly increased.\nWhat contributed to performance? Stocks in the\nfinancials sector contributed the most to the\nFund\u2019s return for the reporting period.\nDiversified banks were positively impacted by\nstrong credit growth, higher interest rates,\nand a growing trend toward digital\ntransformation. The UAE is considered to be\none of the top real estate markets in the\nworld, and companies engaging in real estate\nhave benefited from the country\u2019s relaxed visa\nrequirements and high-net-worth individuals\nseeking luxury investments. What detracted\nfrom performance? The industrials sector,\nparticularly among industrial conglomerates\nand holding companies, detracted from the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period.\nConsumer discretionary stocks were adversely\naffected by ongoing geopolitical tensions,\nparticularly among hotels, restaurants, and\nleisure operators. In the energy sector,\ncompanies in the integrated oil and gas, and\nthe oil and gas drilling industries detracted\nfrom the Fund\u2019s return. Oil and gas prices\ncontinued to come under negative pricing\npressures during the reporting period,\nhampered by geopolitical tensions and supply\nconcerns.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the Bank of England followed\nsuit in August; the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank\nprovided strong indications that it would soon\nlower interest rates. Powered by artificial\nintelligence, information technology stocks\nled the market for most of the reporting\nperiod. However, market sentiment pivoted\ntoward more defensive sectors late in the\nreporting period amid growing uncertainty\nsurrounding economic growth, geopolitics, and\nthe upcoming U.S. presidential election. What\ncontributed to performance? Stocks in the\nfinancials sector contributed the most to the\nFund\u2019s return during the reporting period, led\nby the banking industry. Despite a challenging\nrisk environment, strong earnings and ample\nliquidity supported a rise in valuations for\nmost major U.K. banks, which remain well-\ncapitalized and resilient. Net interest\nmargins (the difference between the rates\nbanks charge for loans and the rates they pay\nfor deposits) declined but remained slightly\nelevated due to still-high interest rates.\nIndustrial stocks also contributed to\nperformance, most notably within the capital\ngoods industry. An aerospace and defense\ncompany benefited from increased demand in the\nfreighter market driven by e-commerce trends\nand declining orders for a dominant competitor\nembroiled in controversy. Stocks in the\nhealthcare sector also contributed, led by the\npharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life\nsciences industry. What detracted from\nperformance? There were no notable detractors\nfrom the Fund\u2019s performance during the\nreporting period that ended August 31, 2024.\nThe views expressed reflect the opinions of\nBlackRock as of the date of this report and\nare subject to change based on changes in\nmarket, economic or other conditions.

Global\nstocks registered solid gains during the\nreporting period as investor confidence\nincreased due to several central banks cutting\ninterest rates, a slowdown in pricing\npressures, and robust corporate earnings. The\nEuropean Central Bank cut its primary lending\nrate in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\nBank provided strong indications that it would\nsoon lower interest rates, while the Bank of\nJapan exited its zero-interest rate policy\nthat it had held since 2016. Governments and\nbusinesses continued to invest in technologies\nto improve water access, quality, and\nmanagement during the reporting period. What\ncontributed to performance? Companies in the\nUnited States were the largest contributors to\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. Within the industrials\nsector, firms focused on industrial machinery\nand supplies and components, particularly\nthose that manufacture products and equipment\nused for water conservation and treatment\nprojects, advanced on growing demand. What\ndetracted from performance? Companies in the\nUnited Kingdom detracted from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance during the reporting period. In\nthe consumer staples sector, a major distiller\nfaced headwinds as large unsold inventory due\nto lower sales caused the firm to miss profit\nexpectations and warn of continued challenges\nahead.

In the United Kingdom,\nfinancials stocks were also strong performers.\nDiversified banks delivered solid earnings\namid increased consumer activity in wealth\nmanagement divisions, growing economic\noptimism, and resilient net interest margins\n(the ratio of interest income minus interest\nexpense divided by earning assets). What\ndetracted from performance? Stocks in Portugal\nmodestly detracted from the Fund\u2019s return\nduring the reporting period. In particular, an\nelectrics utilities firm fell amid rising\ncosts and project delays.

ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF           DiversificationClas\u2026  \n  ESG Advanced MSCI     Diversified           \n  EAFE                                        \n  ESG Advanced MSCI EM  Diversified           \n                                              \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Bank Overdraft: Certain\nFunds had outstanding cash disbursements\nexceeding deposited cash amounts at the\ncustodian during the reporting period. The\nFunds are obligated to repay the custodian for\nany overdraft, including any related costs or\nexpenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatements of Operations. Collateralization:\nIf required by an exchange or counterparty\nagreement, the Funds may be required to\ndeliver/deposit cash and/or securities to/with\nan exchange, or broker-dealer or custodian as\ncollateral for certain investments.\n\n21 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nIn-kind Redemptions: For financial reporting\npurposes, in-kind redemptions are treated as\nsales of securities resulting in realized\ncapital gains or losses to the Funds. Because\nsuch gains or losses are not taxable to the\nFunds and are not distributed to existing Fund\nshareholders, the gains or losses are\nreclassified from accumulated net realized\ngain (loss) to paid-in capital at the end of\nthe Funds\u2019 tax year. These reclassifications\nhave no effect on net assets or net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share. Distributions:\nDividends and distributions paid by each Fund\nare recorded on the ex-dividend dates.\nDistributions are determined on a tax basis\nand may differ from net investment income and\nnet realized capital gains for financial\nreporting purposes. Dividends and\ndistributions are paid in U.S. dollars and\ncannot be automatically reinvested in\nadditional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business\nday, the Funds use current market factors\nsupplied by independent pricing services to\nvalue certain foreign instruments (\u201cSystematic\nFair Value Price\u201d). The Systematic Fair Value\nPrice is designed to value such foreign\nsecurities at fair value as of the close of\ntrading on the NYSE, which follows the close\nof the local markets. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 22\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. As of period end, the following\ntable is a summary of the securities on loan\nby counterparty which are subject to offset\nunder an MSLA:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Securi\u2026           Non-Ca\u2026           \n  ETF     Loaned\u2026     Cash  Collat\u2026      Net  \n  and       Value  Collat\u2026  at Fair   Amount  \n  Count\u2026                    Value(\u2026           \n  ESG                                         \n  Advan\u2026                                      \n  MSCI                                        \n  EAFE                                        \n  BNP                                         \n  Parib\u2026  $279,6\u2026  $(272,\u2026  $\u2014       $7,116\u2026  \n  SA                                          \n  Goldm\u2026                                      \n  Sachs   426,219  -426,2\u2026  \u2014              \u2014  \n  & Co.                                       \n  LLC                                         \n  HSBC                                        \n  Bank    507,783  -507,7\u2026  \u2014              \u2014  \n  PLC                                         \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan    4,349   -4,349  \u2014              \u2014  \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  Scotia                                      \n  Capit\u2026  173,250  -173,2\u2026  \u2014              \u2014  \n  (USA),                                      \n  Inc.                                        \n  State                                       \n  Street                                      \n  Bank &  224,010  -224,0\u2026  \u2014              \u2014  \n  Trust                                       \n  Co.                                         \n  Virtu                                       \n  Ameri\u2026  220,288  -220,2\u2026  \u2014              \u2014  \n  LLC                                         \n          $1,835\u2026  $(1,82\u2026  $\u2014        $7,116  \n  ESG                                         \n  Advan\u2026                                      \n  MSCI                                        \n  EM                                          \n  Citig\u2026                                      \n  Global  $25,260  $(25,2\u2026  $\u2014            $\u2014  \n  Marke\u2026                                      \n  Ltd.                                        \n  Citig\u2026                                      \n  Global   24,243  -24,243  \u2014              \u2014  \n  Marke\u2026                                      \n  Inc.                                        \n  HSBC                                        \n  Bank      9,013   -9,013  \u2014              \u2014  \n  PLC                                         \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan   45,495  -45,495  \u2014              \u2014  \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan   64,339  -64,339  \u2014              \u2014  \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  PLC                                         \n          $168,3\u2026  $(168,\u2026  $\u2014            $\u2014  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Collateral received, if any, in        \n       excess of the market value of          \n       securities on loan is not presented    \n       in this table.

Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund.\n\n23 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Futures\nContracts: Futures contracts are purchased or\nsold to gain exposure to, or manage exposure\nto, changes in interest rates (interest rate\nrisk) and changes in the value of equity\nsecurities (equity risk) or foreign currencies\n(foreign currency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets. 6. INVESTMENT ADVISORY\nAGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH\nAFFILIATES Investment Advisory Fees: Pursuant\nto an Investment Advisory Agreement with the\nTrust, BFA manages the investment of each\nFund\u2019s assets. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock. Under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, except (i) interest and taxes; (ii)\nbrokerage commissions and other expenses\nconnected with the execution of portfolio\ntransactions; (iii) distribution fees; (iv)\nthe advisory fee payable to BFA; and (v)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (in each case as determined by a\nmajority of the independent trustees). For its\ninvestment advisory services to each of the\nfollowing Funds, BFA is entitled to an annual\ninvestment advisory fee, accrued daily and\npaid monthly by the Funds, based on the\naverage daily net assets of each Fund as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF            Investment Advisory  \n                                        Fees  \n  ESG Advanced MSCI                    0.12%  \n  EAFE                                        \n  ESG Advanced MSCI EM                  0.16  \n                                              \nDistributor: BlackRock Investments, LLC, an\naffiliate of BFA, is the distributor for each\nFund. Pursuant to the distribution agreement,\nBFA is responsible for any fees or expenses\nfor distribution services provided to the\nFunds. Securities Lending: The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has issued\nan exemptive order which permits BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, to serve as securities\nlending agent for the Funds, subject to\napplicable conditions. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding any custodial costs. Each Fund is\nresponsible for fees in connection with the\ninvestment of cash collateral received for\nsecurities on loan (the \u201ccollateral investment\nfees\u201d). The cash collateral is invested in a\nmoney market fund, BlackRock Cash Funds:\nInstitutional or BlackRock Cash Funds:\nTreasury, managed by BFA, or its affiliates.\nHowever, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount\nof securities lending income it receives in\norder to effectively limit the collateral\ninvestment fees each Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. The SL Agency Shares of such\nmoney market fund will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. The money market fund in which\nthe cash collateral has been invested may\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee of up to\n2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees. The share of\nsecurities lending income earned by each Fund\nis shown as securities lending income \u2013\naffiliated \u2013 net in its Statements of\nOperations. For the year ended August 31,\n2024, the Funds paid BTC the following amounts\nfor securities lending agent services:\n                                   \n  iShares ETF             Amounts  \n  ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE   $3,358  \n  ESG Advanced MSCI EM      1,390  \n                                   \nNotes to Financial Statements 24\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nOfficers and Trustees: Certain officers and/or\ntrustees of the Trust are officers and/or\ntrustees of BlackRock or its affiliates.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Trust\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date of these financial\nstatements, all of which are subject to\nchange, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV. The tax\ncharacter of distributions paid was as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF            Year           Year  \n                Ended08/31/24  Ended08/31/23  \n  ESG Advanced                                \n  MSCI EAFE                                   \n  Ordinary        $14,835,737     $8,971,067  \n  income                                      \n  ESG Advanced                                \n  MSCI EM                                     \n  Ordinary         $1,763,477     $1,013,727  \n  income                                      \n                                              \nAs of August 31, 2024, the tax components of\naccumulated net earnings (losses) were as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Undist\u2026  Non-ex\u2026      Net           \n  ETF      Income  LossCa\u2026  Unreal\u2026    Total  \n                            (Losse\u2026           \n  ESG                                         \n  Advan\u2026  $6,514\u2026  $(15,9\u2026  $94,53\u2026  $85,07\u2026  \n  MSCI                                        \n  EAFE                                        \n  ESG                                         \n  Advan\u2026  1,203,\u2026  -5,790\u2026  5,495,\u2026  909,192  \n  MSCI                                        \n  EM                                          \n                                              \n25 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n                                              \n  (a)  Amounts available to offset future     \n       realized capital gains.                \n       The difference between book-basis and  \n       tax-basis unrealized gains (losses)    \n       was attributable primarily to the tax  \n       deferral of losses on wash sales, the  \n       realization for tax purposes           \n       ofunrealized gains (losses) on         \n  (b)  certain futures contracts, the timing  \n       and recognition of partnership         \n       income, the characterization of        \n       corporate actions and the realization  \n       for tax purposesof unrealized gains    \n       on investments in passive foreign      \n       investment companies.                  \n                                              \nA fund may own shares in certain foreign\ninvestment entities, referred to, under U.S.\ntax law, as \u201cpassive foreign investment\ncompanies.\u201d Such fund may elect to mark-to-\nmarket annually the shares of each passive\nforeign investment company and would be\nrequired to distribute to shareholders any\nsuch marked-to-market gains.

LINE OF CREDIT The iShares ESG Advanced\nMSCI EM ETF, along with certain other iShares\nfunds (\u201cParticipating Funds\u201d), is a party to a\n$800 million credit agreement (\u201cSyndicated\nCredit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders,\nwhich expires on October 16, 2024. The line of\ncredit may be used for temporary or emergency\npurposes, including redemptions, settlement of\ntrades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings\nin certain target markets. The Funds may\nborrow up to the aggregate commitment amount\nsubject to asset coverage and other\nlimitations as specified in the Syndicated\nCredit Agreement. The Syndicated Credit\nAgreement has the following terms: a\ncommitment fee of 0.15% per annum on the\nunused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. For the year\nended August 31, 2024, the maximum amount\nborrowed, the average daily borrowing and the\nweighted average interest rate, if any, under\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement were as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares   MaximumA\u2026  AverageBo\u2026  Weighted\u2026  \n  ETF                              Rates      \n  ESG                                         \n  Advanced  $1,729,8\u2026     $49,812  6.43%      \n  MSCI EM                                     \n                                              \n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nMarket Risk: Investments in the securities of\nissuers domiciled in countries with emerging\ncapital markets involve certain additional\nrisks that do not generally apply to\ninvestments in securities of issuers in more\ndeveloped capital markets, such as (i) low or\nnonexistent trading volume, resulting in a\nlack of liquidity and increased volatility in\nprices for such securities; (ii) lack of\nreliable settlement procedures and significant\ndelays in registering the transfer of\nsecurities; (iii) uncertain national policies\nand social, political and economic\ninstability, increasing the potential for\nexpropriation of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, high rates of inflation or\nunfavorable diplomatic developments; (iv) lack\nof publicly available or reliable information\nabout issuers as a result of not being subject\nto the same degree of regulatory requirements\nand accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards; and (v) possible\nfluctuations in exchange rates, differing\nlegal systems and the existence or possible\nimposition of exchange controls, custodial\nrestrictions or other foreign or U.S.\ngovernmental laws or restrictions applicable\nto such investments. Valuation Risk: The\nmarket values of equities, such as common\nstocks and preferred securities or equity\nrelated investments, such as futures and\noptions, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 26\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nindustries. A fund may invest in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests. The price each Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from each\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for securities that trade in thin\nor volatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation technique or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. Changes to\nsignificant unobservable inputs and\nassumptions (i.e., publicly traded company\nmultiples, growth rate, time to exit) due to\nthe lack of observable inputs may\nsignificantly impact the resulting fair value\nand therefore each Fund\u2019s results of\noperations. As a result, the price received\nupon the sale of an investment may be less\nthan the value ascribed by each Fund, and each\nFund could realize a greater than expected\nloss or lesser than expected gain upon the\nsale of the investment. Each Fund\u2019s ability to\nvalue its investments may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Counterparty Credit Risk: The Funds\nmay be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or\nthe risk that an entity may fail to or be\nunable to perform on its commitments related\nto unsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy and at that time there\nis a shortfall in the aggregate amount of\nmargin held by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. Certain Funds\ninvest a significant portion of their assets\nin issuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. Investment\npercentages in specific countries are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nCertain Funds invest a significant portion of\ntheir assets in securities of issuers located\nin Europe or with significant exposure to\nEuropean issuers or countries. The European\nfinancial markets have recently experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns in, or rising\ngovernment debt levels of, several European\ncountries as well as acts of war in the\nregion. These events may spread to other\ncountries in Europe and may affect the value\nand liquidity of certain of the Funds\u2019\ninvestments. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not work, may result in\nsocial unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and others of\ntheir debt could have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. The United\nKingdom has withdrawn from the European Union,\nand one or more other countries may withdraw\nfrom the European Union and/or abandon the\nEuro, the common currency of the European\nUnion. These events and actions have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely\naffect , the value and exchange rate of the\nEuro and may continue to significantly affect\nthe economies of every country in Europe,\nincluding countries that do not use the Euro\nand non-European Union member states. The\nimpact of these actions, especially if they\noccur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear\nbut could be significant and far reaching. In\naddition, Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions in the region are\nimpossible to predict, but have been, and may\ncontinue to be, significant and have a severe\nadverse effect on the region, including\nsignificant negative impacts on the economy\nand the markets for certain securities and\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors. Certain Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in China or with\nsignificant exposure to Chinese issuers.\nInvestments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed securities, involve\nrisks specific to China. China may be subject\nto considerable degrees of economic, political\nand social instability and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets.\nChinese markets generally continue to\nexperience\n\n27 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ninefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies\nresulting from governmental influence, a lack\nof publicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Internal\nsocial unrest or confrontations with other\nneighboring countries may disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. Incidents involving\nChina\u2019s or the region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in Chinese markets and may\nadversely affect the Chinese economy and a\nfund\u2019s investments. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of tariffs,\nsanctions or other trade barriers, or a\ndownturn in any of the economies of China\u2019s\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy. In addition,\nmeasures may be taken to limit the flow of\ncapital and/or sanctions may be imposed, which\ncould prohibit or restrict the ability to own\nor transfer fund assets and may also include\nretaliatory actions, such as seizure of fund\nassets. Certain Funds invest a significant\nportion of their assets in securities of\nissuers located in Asia or with significant\nexposure to Asian issuers or countries. The\nAsian financial markets have recently\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns in several Asian countries\nregarding monetary policy, government\nintervention in the markets, rising government\ndebt levels or economic downturns. These\nevents may spread to other countries in Asia\nand may affect the value and liquidity of\ncertain of the Funds\u2019 investments. Certain\nFunds invest a significant portion of their\nassets in securities within a single or\nlimited number of market sectors. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions affecting such\nsectors may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nInvestment percentages in specific sectors are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nSignificant Shareholder Redemption Risk:\nCertain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany, the Trust\u2019s administrator, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\nshares sold in the table above. To the extent\napplicable, to facilitate the timely\nsettlement of orders for Funds using a\nclearing facility outside of the continuous\nnet settlement process, the Funds, at their\nsole discretion, may permit an Authorized\nParticipant to post cash as collateral in\nanticipation of the delivery of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, as further described in\nthe applicable Authorized Participant\nAgreement. The collateral process is subject\nto a Control Agreement among the Authorized\nParticipant, each Funds\u2019 custodian, and the\nFunds. In the event that the Authorized\nParticipant fails to deliver all or a portion\nof the applicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, the Funds may exercise control\nover such collateral pursuant to the terms of\nthe Control Agreement in order to purchase the\napplicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities. From time to time, settlement of\nsecurities related to in-kind contributions or\nin-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 12. FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX\nCLAIMS Certain of the outstanding foreign tax\nreclaims are not deemed by the Fund to meet\nthe recognition criteria under U.S. GAAP as of\nAugust 31, 2024 and have not been recorded in\nthe applicable Fund\u2019s net asset value. The\nrecognition by the Fund of these amounts would\nhave a positive impact on the applicable\nFund's performance. If a Fund receives a tax\nrefund that has not been previously recorded,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time the claim is\nsuccessful will benefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors who sold\ntheir shares prior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 28\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has\nissued guidance to address U.S. income tax\nliabilities attributable to fund shareholders\nresulting from the recovery of foreign taxes\nwithheld in prior calendar years. These\nwithheld foreign taxes were passed through to\nshareholders in the form of foreign tax\ncredits in the year the taxes were withheld.\nAssuming there are sufficient foreign taxes\npaid which each of the iShares ESG Advanced\nMSCI EAFE ETF is able to pass through to\nshareholders as a foreign tax credit in the\ncurrent year, the Fund will be able to offset\nthe prior years' withholding taxes recovered\nagainst the foreign taxes paid in the current\nyear. Accordingly, no federal income tax\nliability is recorded by the Fund. 13.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management\u2019s evaluation of\nthe impact of all subsequent events on the\nFunds\u2019 financial statements was completed\nthrough the date the financial statements were\navailable to be issued and the following item\nwas noted: Effective October 16, 2024, the\nSyndicated Credit Agreement to which the\nParticipating Funds are party was amended to\nextend the maturity date to October 15, 2025\nunder the same terms.\n\n29 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Trustees of\niShares Trust and Shareholders of each of the\ntwo funds listed in the table below Opinions\non the Financial Statements We have audited\nthe accompanying statements of assets and\nliabilities, including the schedules of\ninvestments, of each of the funds listed in\nthe table below (two of the funds constituting\niShares Trust, hereafter collectively referred\nto as the \"Funds\") as of August 31, 2024, the\nrelated statements of operations for the year\nended August 31, 2024, the statements of\nchanges in net assets for each of the two\nyears in the period ended August 31, 2024,\nincluding the related notes, and the financial\nhighlights for each of the periods indicated\ntherein (collectively referred to as the\n\u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of\neach of the Funds listed in the table below as\nof August 31, 2024, the results of each of\ntheir operations for the year then ended, the\nchanges in each of their net assets for each\nof the two years in the period ended August\n31, 2024 and each of the financial highlights\nfor each of the periods indicated therein in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\n                                      \n  iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF  \n  iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF    \n                                      \nBasis for Opinions These financial statements\nare the responsibility of the Funds\u2019\nmanagement. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Funds in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. Our procedures\nincluded confirmation of securities owned as\nof August 31, 2024 by correspondence with the\ncustodian, transfer agent and brokers; when\nreplies were not received from brokers, we\nperformed other auditing procedures. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 24, 2024 We have served as the auditor\nof one or more BlackRock investment companies\nsince 2000.\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm 30\n\nImportant Tax Information (unaudited)\n\nThe following amounts, or maximum amounts\nallowable by law, are hereby designated as\nqualified dividend income for individuals for\nthe fiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF                      Qualified  \n                              DividendIncome  \n  ESG Advanced MSCI              $14,582,030  \n  EAFE                                        \n  ESG Advanced MSCI EM             1,219,946  \n                                              \nThe Funds intend to pass through to their\nshareholders the following amounts, or maximum\namounts allowable by law, of foreign source\nincome earned and foreign taxes paid for the\nfiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                      Foreign   ForeignTaxes  \n  iShares ETF    SourceIncome           Paid  \n                       Earned                 \n  ESG Advanced    $16,264,308     $1,364,138  \n  MSCI EAFE                                   \n  ESG Advanced      2,319,146        328,539  \n  MSCI EM                                     \n                                              \n31 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPremium/Discount Information Information on\nthe Fund's net asset value, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads\ncan be found at iShares.com .

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\n33 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 34\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\n35 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                       \n        Portfolio Abbreviation         \n  ADR   American Depositary Receipt    \n  GDR   Global Depositary Receipt      \n  NVDR  Non-Voting Depositary Receipt  \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares              \n  PJSC  Public Joint Stock Company     \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust   \n                                       \nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report 36\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF          DiversificationClass\u2026  \n  MSCI China           Non-diversified        \n  Multisector Tech                            \n  MSCI Japan Value     Diversified            \n                                              \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Bank Overdraft: Certain\nFunds had outstanding cash disbursements\nexceeding deposited cash amounts at the\ncustodian during the reporting period. The\nFunds are obligated to repay the custodian for\nany overdraft, including any related costs or\nexpenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatements of Operations. Collateralization:\nIf required by an exchange or counterparty\nagreement, the Funds may be required to\ndeliver/deposit cash and/or securities to/with\nan exchange, or broker-dealer or custodian as\ncollateral for certain investments.\n\n15 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nIn-kind Redemptions: For financial reporting\npurposes, in-kind redemptions are treated as\nsales of securities resulting in realized\ncapital gains or losses to the Funds. Because\nsuch gains or losses are not taxable to the\nFunds and are not distributed to existing Fund\nshareholders, the gains or losses are\nreclassified from accumulated net realized\ngain (loss) to paid-in capital at the end of\nthe Funds\u2019 tax year. These reclassifications\nhave no effect on net assets or net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share. Distributions:\nDividends and distributions paid by each Fund\nare recorded on the ex-dividend dates.\nDistributions are determined on a tax basis\nand may differ from net investment income and\nnet realized capital gains for financial\nreporting purposes. Dividends and\ndistributions are paid in U.S. dollars and\ncannot be automatically reinvested in\nadditional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business\nday, the Funds use current market factors\nsupplied by independent pricing services to\nvalue certain foreign instruments (\u201cSystematic\nFair Value Price\u201d). The Systematic Fair Value\nPrice is designed to value such foreign\nsecurities at fair value as of the close of\ntrading on the NYSE, which follows the close\nof the local markets. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 16\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. The risks of securities lending\ninclude the risk that the borrower may not\nprovide additional collateral when required or\nmay not return the securities when due. To\nmitigate these risks, each Fund benefits from\na borrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund. 5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL\nINSTRUMENTS Futures Contracts: Futures\ncontracts are purchased or sold to gain\nexposure to, or manage exposure to, changes in\ninterest rates (interest rate risk) and\nchanges in the value of equity securities\n(equity risk) or foreign currencies (foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets. 6. INVESTMENT ADVISORY\nAGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH\nAFFILIATES Investment Advisory Fees: Pursuant\nto an Investment Advisory Agreement with the\nTrust, BFA manages the investment of each\nFund\u2019s assets. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock. Under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, except (i) interest and taxes; (ii)\nbrokerage commissions and other expenses\nconnected with the execution of portfolio\ntransactions; (iii) distribution fees; (iv)\nthe advisory fee payable to BFA; and (v)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (in each case as determined by a\nmajority of the independent trustees).\n\n17 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nFor its investment advisory services to each\nof the following Funds, BFA is entitled to an\nannual investment advisory fee, accrued daily\nand paid monthly by the Funds, based on the\naverage daily net assets of each Fund as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF            Investment Advisory  \n                                        Fees  \n  MSCI China                           0.59%  \n  Multisector Tech                            \n  MSCI Japan Value                      0.15  \n                                              \nDistributor: BlackRock Investments, LLC, an\naffiliate of BFA, is the distributor for each\nFund. Pursuant to the distribution agreement,\nBFA is responsible for any fees or expenses\nfor distribution services provided to the\nFunds. Securities Lending: The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has issued\nan exemptive order which permits BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, to serve as securities\nlending agent for the Funds, subject to\napplicable conditions. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding any custodial costs. Each Fund is\nresponsible for fees in connection with the\ninvestment of cash collateral received for\nsecurities on loan (the \u201ccollateral investment\nfees\u201d). The cash collateral is invested in a\nmoney market fund, BlackRock Cash Funds:\nInstitutional or BlackRock Cash Funds:\nTreasury, managed by BFA, or its affiliates.\nHowever, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount\nof securities lending income it receives in\norder to effectively limit the collateral\ninvestment fees each Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. The SL Agency Shares of such\nmoney market fund will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. The money market fund in which\nthe cash collateral has been invested may\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee of up to\n2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Trust\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date of these financial\nstatements, all of which are subject to\nchange, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV. U.S. GAAP\nrequires that certain components of net assets\nbe adjusted to reflect permanent differences\nbetween financial and tax reporting. These\nreclassifications have no effect on net assets\nor NAV per share. As of August 31, 2024,\npermanent differences attributable to realized\ngains (losses) from in-kind redemptions were\nreclassified to the following accounts:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF         Paid-in  AccumulatedE\u2026  \n                      Capital  (Loss)         \n  MSCI Japan      $23,313,920  $(23,313,920)  \n  Value                                       \n                                              \nThe tax character of distributions paid was as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF            Year           Year  \n                Ended08/31/24  Ended08/31/23  \n  MSCI China                                  \n  Multisector                                 \n  Tech                                        \n  Ordinary           $292,763        $83,031  \n  income                                      \n  MSCI Japan                                  \n  Value                                       \n  Ordinary         $8,428,918     $3,996,856  \n  income                                      \n                                              \nAs of August 31, 2024, the tax components of\naccumulated net earnings (losses) were as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Undist\u2026  Non-ex\u2026      Net           \n  ETF      Income  LossCa\u2026  Unreal\u2026    Total  \n                            (Losse\u2026           \n  MSCI                                        \n  China   $86,608  $(1,52\u2026  $(2,38\u2026  $(3,83\u2026  \n  Multi\u2026                                      \n  Tech                                        \n  MSCI                                        \n  Japan   3,878,\u2026  -6,309\u2026  27,926\u2026  25,495\u2026  \n  Value                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Amounts available to offset future     \n       realized capital gains.                \n       The difference between book-basis and  \n       tax-basis unrealized gains (losses)    \n       was attributable primarily to the tax  \n       deferral of losses on wash sales, the  \n  (b)  timing and recognition ofpartnership   \n       income, the characterization of        \n       corporate actions and the realization  \n       for tax purposes of unrealized gains   \n       on investments in passive foreign      \n       investment companies.                  \n                                              \nA fund may own shares in certain foreign\ninvestment entities, referred to, under U.S.\ntax law, as \u201cpassive foreign investment\ncompanies.\u201d Such fund may elect to mark-to-\nmarket annually the shares of each passive\nforeign investment company and would be\nrequired to distribute to shareholders any\nsuch marked-to-market gains.\n\n19 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nAs of August 31, 2024, gross unrealized\nappreciation and depreciation based on cost of\ninvestments (including short positions and\nderivatives, if any) for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes were as follows:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026      Tax    Gross    Gross      Net  \n  ETF        Cost  Unreal\u2026  Unreal\u2026  Unreal\u2026  \n  MSCI                                        \n  China   $8,444\u2026  $323,6\u2026  $(2,71\u2026  $(2,38\u2026  \n  Multi\u2026                                      \n  Tech                                        \n  MSCI                                        \n  Japan   242,08\u2026  33,685\u2026  -5,790\u2026  27,894\u2026  \n  Value                                       \n                                              \n9. LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the Funds did not\nborrow under the Syndicated Credit Agreement.\n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nValuation Risk: The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests. Counterparty Credit Risk: The\nFunds may be exposed to counterparty credit\nrisk, or the risk that an entity may fail to\nor be unable to perform on its commitments\nrelated to unsettled or open transactions,\nincluding making timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 20\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nbankruptcy and at that time there is a\nshortfall in the aggregate amount of margin\nheld by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nissuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund's investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in China or with\nsignificant exposure to Chinese issuers.\nInvestments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed securities, involve\nrisks specific to China. China may be subject\nto considerable degrees of economic, political\nand social instability and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets.\nChinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with other neighboring\ncountries may disrupt economic development in\nChina and result in a greater risk of currency\nfluctuations, currency non-convertibility,\ninterest rate fluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation. Incidents involving China\u2019s or the\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and a fund\u2019s investments.\nReduction in spending on Chinese products and\nservices, supply chain diversification,\ninstitution of tariffs, sanctions or other\ntrade barriers, or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.\nIn addition, measures may be taken to limit\nthe flow of capital and/or sanctions may be\nimposed, which could prohibit or restrict the\nability to own or transfer fund assets and may\nalso include retaliatory actions, such as\nseizure of fund assets. The Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in Asia or with\nsignificant exposure to Asian issuers or\ncountries. The Asian financial markets have\nrecently experienced volatility and adverse\ntrends due to concerns in several Asian\ncountries regarding monetary policy,\ngovernment intervention in the markets, rising\ngovernment debt levels or economic downturns.\nThese events may spread to other countries in\nAsia and may affect the value and liquidity of\ncertain of the Funds\u2019 investments. The Funds\ninvest a significant portion of their assets\nin securities within a single or limited\nnumber of market sectors. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions affecting such\nsectors may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nInvestment percentages in specific sectors are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nSignificant Shareholder Redemption Risk:\nCertain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities.

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was provided with\na detailed description of the proprietary ETF\nmethodology used by Broadridge to determine\nthe Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board noted that,\ndue to the limitations in providing comparable\nfunds in the Peer Group, the statistical\ninformation provided in Broadridge\u2019s report\nmay or may not provide meaningful direct\ncomparisons to the Fund in all instances. The\nBoard also noted that the investment advisory\nfee rate and overall expenses (net of any\nwaivers and reimbursements) for the Fund were\nlower than the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds. In addition, to the extent that any of\nthe comparison funds included in the Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds, track the same\nindex as the Fund, Broadridge also provided,\nand the Board reviewed, a comparison of the\nFund\u2019s performance for the one-year, three-\nyear, five-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods.The Board noted that the Fund seeks to\ntrack its specified underlying index and that,\nduring the year, the Board received periodic\nreports on the Fund\u2019s short- and longer-term\nperformance in comparison with its underlying\nindex.Such periodic comparative performance\ninformation, including additional detailed\ninformation as requested by the Board, was\nalso considered.The Board noted that the Fund\ngenerally performed in line with its\nunderlying index over the relevant periods.\nBased on this review, the other relevant\nfactors and information considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years.In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 26\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase.However, the Board\nnoted that it would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund.The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\n27 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 28\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                      \n        Portfolio Abbreviation        \n  ADR   American Depositary Receipt   \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares             \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust  \n                                      \n29 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

Statements\n\n1. ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF           DiversificationClas\u2026  \n  MSCI India            Non-diversified       \n  MSCI India Small-Cap  Diversified           \n                                              \nBasis of Consolidation: The accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for MSCI\nIndia Small-Cap included the accounts of its\nsubsidiary in the Republic of Mauritius, which\nwas a wholly-owned subsidiary (each, a\n\u201cSubsidiary\u201d) of the Fund that invested in\nIndian securities. On June 16, 2023, the Fund\nfiled to liquidate its Subsidiary with the\nMauritius Financial Services Commission. 2.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial\nstatements are prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d),\nwhich may require management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities in the\nfinancial statements, disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts\nof increases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Bank Overdraft: The Funds\nhad outstanding cash disbursements exceeding\ndeposited cash amounts at the custodian during\nthe reporting period. The Funds are obligated\nto repay the custodian for any overdraft,\nincluding any related costs or expenses, where\napplicable. For financial reporting purposes,\noverdraft fees, if any, are included in\ninterest expense in the Statements of\nOperations. Collateralization: If required by\nan exchange or counterparty agreement, the\nFunds may be required to deliver/deposit cash\nand/or securities to/with an exchange, or\nbroker-dealer or custodian as collateral for\ncertain investments.\n\n19 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nDistributions: Dividends and distributions\npaid by each Fund are recorded on the ex-\ndividend dates. Distributions are determined\non a tax basis and may differ from net\ninvestment income, net realized capital gains\nand/or return of capital for financial\nreporting purposes. Dividends and\ndistributions are paid in U.S. dollars and\ncannot be automatically reinvested in\nadditional shares of the Funds. The portion of\ndistributions that exceeds each Fund's current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will\nconstitute a non-taxable return of capital.\nDistributions in excess of each Fund's minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof the Fund's earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to the Fund's shareholders and will\nnot constitute non-taxable returns of capital.\nReturn of capital distributions will reduce a\nshareholder's cost basis and will result in\nhigher capital gains or lower capital losses\nwhen each Fund's shares on which distributions\nwere received are sold. Once a shareholder's\ncost basis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as capital\ngains. Indemnifications: In the normal course\nof business, each Fund enters into contracts\nthat contain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d). \u2022 Futures contracts are valued\nbased on that day\u2019s last reported settlement\nor trade price on the exchange where the\ncontract is traded. Generally, trading in\nforeign instruments is substantially completed\neach day at various times prior to the close\nof trading on the New York Stock Exchange\n(\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business day, the Funds use\ncurrent market factors supplied by independent\npricing services to value certain foreign\ninstruments (\u201cSystematic Fair Value Price\u201d).\nThe Systematic Fair Value Price is designed to\nvalue such foreign securities at fair value as\nof the close of trading on the NYSE, which\nfollows the close of the local markets. If\nevents (e.g., market volatility, company\nannouncement or a natural disaster) occur that\nare expected to materially affect the value of\nsuch investment, or in the event that\napplication of these methods of valuation\nresults in a price for an investment that is\ndeemed not to be representative of the market\nvalue of such investment, or if a price is not\navailable, the investment will be valued by\nthe Valuation Committee, in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value (\u201cFair Valued Investments\u201d). The\nfair valuation approaches that may be used by\nthe Valuation Committee include market\napproach, income approach and cost approach.\nValuation techniques such as discounted cash\nflow, use of market comparables and matrix\npricing are types of valuation approaches and\nare typically used in determining fair value.\nWhen determining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 20\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Futures\nContracts: Futures contracts are purchased or\nsold to gain exposure to, or manage exposure\nto, changes in interest rates (interest rate\nrisk) and changes in the value of equity\nsecurities (equity risk) or foreign currencies\n(foreign currency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets. 5. INVESTMENT ADVISORY\nAGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH\nAFFILIATES Investment Advisory Fees: Pursuant\nto an Investment Advisory Agreement with the\nTrust, BlackRock Fund Advisors (\"BFA\") manages\nthe investment of each Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\"BlackRock\"). Under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, except (i) interest and taxes; (ii)\nbrokerage commissions and other expenses\nconnected with the execution of portfolio\ntransactions; (iii) distribution fees; (iv)\nthe advisory fee payable to BFA; and (v)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (in each case as determined by a\nmajority of the independent trustees). For its\ninvestment advisory services to the iShares\nMSCI India ETF, BFA is entitled to an annual\ninvestment advisory fee, accrued daily and\npaid monthly by the Fund, based on the average\ndaily net assets of the Fund as follows:\n                                              \n  Aggregate Average      Investment Advisory  \n  Daily Net Assets                      Fees  \n  First $4 billion                   0.6500%  \n  Over $4 billion, up                         \n  to and including $6                 0.6175  \n  billion                                     \n  Over $6 billion, up                         \n  to and including $8                 0.5867  \n  billion                                     \n  Over $8 billion                     0.5573  \n                                              \nFor its investment advisory services to the\niShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, BFA is\nentitled to an annual investment advisory fee\nof 0.74%, accrued daily and paid monthly by\nthe Fund, based on the average daily net\nassets of the Fund. Distributor: BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\"BRIL\"), an affiliate of\nBFA, is the distributor for each Fund.\nPursuant to the distribution agreement, BFA is\nresponsible for any fees or expenses for\ndistribution services provided to the Funds.\nOfficers and Trustees: Certain officers and/or\ntrustees of the Trust are officers and/or\ntrustees of BlackRock or its affiliates. Other\nTransactions: Each Fund may invest its\npositive cash balances in certain money market\nfunds managed by BFA or an affiliate. The\nincome earned on these temporary cash\ninvestments is shown as dividends \u2013 affiliated\nin the Statements of Operations. A fund, in\norder to improve its portfolio liquidity and\nits ability to track its underlying index, may\ninvest in shares of other iShares funds that\ninvest in securities in the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. 6. PURCHASES AND SALES For the year\nended August 31, 2024, purchases and sales of\ninvestments, excluding short-term securities\nand in-kind transactions, were as follows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF       Purchases          Sales  \n  MSCI India    $4,912,649,9\u2026  $2,148,405,6\u2026  \n  MSCI India      675,490,558    374,224,596  \n  Small-Cap                                   \n                                              \nThere were no in-kind transactions for the\nyear ended August 31, 2024. 7. INCOME TAX\nINFORMATION Each Fund is treated as an entity\nseparate from the Trust\u2019s other funds for\nfederal income tax purposes. It is each Fund\u2019s\npolicy to comply with the requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\napplicable to regulated investment companies,\nand to distribute substantially all of its\ntaxable income to its shareholders. Therefore,\nno U.S. federal income tax provision is\nrequired. Management has analyzed tax laws and\nregulations and their application to the Funds\nas of August 31, 2024, inclusive of the open\ntax return years, and does not believe that\nthere are any uncertain tax positions that\nrequire recognition of a tax liability in the\nFunds\u2019 financial statements. Management\u2019s\nanalysis is based on the tax laws and\n\n21 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect as of the date of these\nfinancial statements, all of which are subject\nto change, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV.

LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the Funds did not\nborrow under the Syndicated Credit Agreement.\n9. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 22\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nValuation Risk: The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests. The price each Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from each\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for securities that trade in thin\nor volatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation technique or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. Changes to\nsignificant unobservable inputs and\nassumptions (i.e., publicly traded company\nmultiples, growth rate, time to exit) due to\nthe lack of observable inputs may\nsignificantly impact the resulting fair value\nand therefore each Fund\u2019s results of\noperations. As a result, the price received\nupon the sale of an investment may be less\nthan the value ascribed by each Fund, and each\nFund could realize a greater than expected\nloss or lesser than expected gain upon the\nsale of the investment. Each Fund\u2019s ability to\nvalue its investments may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Counterparty Credit Risk: The Funds\nmay be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or\nthe risk that an entity may fail to or be\nunable to perform on its commitments related\nto unsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy and at that time there\nis a shortfall in the aggregate amount of\nmargin held by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nissuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund's investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in Asia or with\nsignificant exposure to Asian issuers or\ncountries. The Asian financial markets have\nrecently experienced volatility and adverse\ntrends due to concerns in several Asian\ncountries regarding monetary policy,\ngovernment intervention in the markets, rising\ngovernment debt levels or economic downturns.\nThese events may spread to other countries in\nAsia and may affect the value and liquidity of\ncertain of the Funds\u2019 investments. The Funds\ninvest a significant portion of their assets\nin securities within a single or limited\nnumber of market sectors. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions affecting such\nsectors may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nInvestment percentages in specific sectors are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nSignificant Shareholder Redemption Risk:\nCertain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 10. CAPITAL\nSHARE TRANSACTIONS Capital shares are issued\nand redeemed by each Fund only in aggregations\nof a specified number of shares or multiples\nthereof (\u201cCreation Units\u201d) at NAV.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany, the Trust\u2019s administrator, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\nshares sold in the table above. To the extent\napplicable, to facilitate the timely\nsettlement of orders for Funds using a\nclearing facility outside of the continuous\nnet settlement process, the Funds, at their\nsole discretion, may permit an Authorized\nParticipant to post cash as collateral in\nanticipation of the delivery of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, as further described in\nthe applicable Authorized Participant\nAgreement. The collateral process is subject\nto a Control Agreement among the Authorized\nParticipant, each Funds\u2019 custodian, and the\nFunds. In the event that the Authorized\nParticipant fails to deliver all or a portion\nof the applicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, the Funds may exercise control\nover such collateral pursuant to the terms of\nthe Control Agreement in order to purchase the\napplicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities. 11.

Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the\nFunds\u2019 financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to\nthe Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\naudits of these financial statements in\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nThose standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits\nincluded performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. Our procedures\nincluded confirmation of securities owned as\nof August 31, 2024 by correspondence with the\ncustodian, transfer agent and brokers; when\nreplies were not received from brokers, we\nperformed other auditing procedures. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 24, 2024 We have served as the auditor\nof one or more BlackRock investment companies\nsince 2000.\n\n25 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nImportant Tax Information (unaudited)\n\nThe following amounts, or maximum amounts\nallowable by law, are hereby designated as\nqualified dividend income for individuals for\nthe fiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF                      Qualified  \n                              DividendIncome  \n  MSCI India                    $106,152,077  \n  MSCI India Small-Cap             5,589,797  \n                                              \nThe Funds hereby designate the following\namounts, or maximum amounts allowable by law,\nas capital gain dividends, subject to a long-\nterm capital gains tax rate as noted below,\nfor the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                                    20% Rate  \n  iShares ETF               Long-TermCapital  \n                              Gain Dividends  \n  MSCI India Small-Cap            $1,937,789  \n                                              \nThe Funds intend to pass through to their\nshareholders the following amounts, or maximum\namounts allowable by law, of foreign source\nincome earned and foreign taxes paid for the\nfiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                      Foreign   ForeignTaxes  \n  iShares ETF    SourceIncome           Paid  \n                       Earned                 \n  MSCI India     $113,382,556    $77,709,080  \n  MSCI India        7,109,633     14,211,250  \n  Small-Cap                                   \n                                              \nImportant Tax Information 26\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPremium/Discount Information Information on\nthe Fund's net asset value, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads\ncan be found at iShares.com . Regulation under\nthe Alternative Investment Fund Managers\nDirective The Alternative Investment Fund\nManagers Directive, and its United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d) equivalent, (the \u201cAIFMD\u201d) impose\ndetailed and prescriptive obligations on fund\nmanagers established in the European Union\n(the \u201cEU\u201d) and the UK. These do not currently\napply to managers established outside of the\nEU or UK, such as BFA (the \u201cCompany\u201d).\nHowever, the Company is required to comply\nwith certain disclosure, reporting and\ntransparency obligations of the AIFMD because\nit has registered the iShares MSCI India ETF\n(the \u201cFund\u201d) to be marketed to investors in\nthe EU and/or UK. Report on Remuneration\nBlackRock has a clear and well-defined pay-\nfor-performance philosophy, and compensation\nprograms which support that philosophy.\nBlackRock operates a total compensation model\nfor remuneration which includes a base salary,\nwhich is contractual, and a discretionary\nbonus scheme. Although all employees are\neligible to receive a discretionary bonus,\nthere is no contractual obligation to make a\ndiscretionary bonus award to any employees.\nFor senior management and staff who have the\nability to materially affect the risk profile\nof the Fund, a significant percentage of\nvariable remuneration is deferred over time.\nAll employees are subject to a clawback\npolicy. Remuneration decisions for employees\nare made once annually in January following\nthe end of the performance year, based on\nBlackRock\u2019s full-year financial results and\nother non-financial goals and objectives.\nAlongside financial performance, individual\ntotal compensation is also based on strategic\nand operating results and other considerations\nsuch as management and leadership\ncapabilities. No set formulas are established\nand no fixed benchmarks are used in\ndetermining annual incentive awards. Annual\nincentive awards are paid from a bonus pool\nwhich is reviewed throughout the year by\nBlackRock's independent compensation\ncommittee, taking into account both actual and\nprojected financial information together with\ninformation provided by the Enterprise Risk\nand Regulatory Compliance departments in\nrelation to any activities, incidents or\nevents that warrant consideration in making\ncompensation decisions. Individuals are not\ninvolved in setting their own remuneration.\nEach of the control functions (Enterprise\nRisk, Legal & Compliance, Finance, Human\nResources and Internal Audit) each have their\nown organizational structures which are\nindependent of the business units and\ntherefore staff members in control functions\nare remunerated independently of the\nbusinesses they oversee. Functional bonus\npools for those control functions are\ndetermined with reference to the performance\nof each individual function and the\nremuneration of the senior members of control\nfunctions is directly overseen by BlackRock's\nindependent remuneration committee. The\nCompany is required under the AIFMD to make\nquantitative disclosures of remuneration.\nThese disclosures are made in line with\nBlackRock\u2019s interpretation of currently\navailable regulatory guidance on quantitative\nremuneration disclosures. As market or\nregulatory practice develops BlackRock may\nconsider it appropriate to make changes to the\nway in which quantitative remuneration\ndisclosures are calculated. Where such changes\nare made, this may result in disclosures in\nrelation to a fund not being comparable to the\ndisclosures made in the prior year, or in\nrelation to other BlackRock fund disclosures\nin that same year. BlackRock bases its\nproportionality approach on a combination of\nfactors that it is entitled to take into\naccount based on relevant guidelines.\nRemuneration information at an individual Fund\nlevel is not readily available. Disclosures\nare provided in relation to (a) the staff of\nthe Company; (b) staff who are senior\nmanagement; (c) staff who have the ability to\nmaterially affect the risk profile of the\nFund; and (d) staff of companies to which\nportfolio management and risk management has\nbeen formally delegated. All individuals\nincluded in the aggregated figures disclosed\nare rewarded in line with BlackRock\u2019s\nremuneration policy for their responsibilities\nacross the relevant BlackRock business area.\nAs all individuals have a number of areas of\nresponsibilities, only the portion of\nremuneration for those individuals\u2019 services\nattributable to the Fund is included in the\naggregate figures disclosed. Members of staff\nand senior management of the Company typically\nprovide both AIFMD and non-AIFMD related\nservices in respect of multiple funds, clients\nand functions of the Company and across the\nbroader BlackRock group. Conversely, members\nof staff and senior management of the broader\nBlackRock group may provide both AIFMD and\nnon-AIFMD related services in respect of\nmultiple funds, clients and functions of the\nbroader BlackRock group and of the Company.\nTherefore, the figures disclosed are a sum of\nindividuals\u2019 portion of remuneration\nattributable to the Company according to an\nobjective apportionment methodology which\nacknowledges the multiple-service nature of\nthe Company and the broader BlackRock group.\nAccordingly, the figures are not\nrepresentative of any individual\u2019s actual\nremuneration or their remuneration structure.\nThe amount of the total remuneration awarded\nto the Company\u2019s staff in respect of the\nCompany\u2019s financial year ending December 31,\n2023 was USD 5.43m. This figure is comprised\nof fixed remuneration of USD 0.74m and\nvariable remuneration of USD 4.68m. There was\na total of 8 beneficiaries of the remuneration\ndescribed above. The amount of the aggregate\nremuneration awarded by the Company in respect\nof the Company\u2019s financial year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, to its senior management\nwas USD 3.66m, and to other members of its\nstaff whose actions potentially have a\nmaterial impact on the risk profile of the\nCompany or its funds was USD 1.77m.\n\n27 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nAdditional Information (continued)\n\nDisclosures Under the EU Sustainable Finance\nDisclosure Regulation The iShares MSCI India\nETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) is registered under the\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\nto be marketed to European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\ninvestors, as noted above. As a result,\ncertain disclosures are required under the EU\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n(\u201cSFDR\u201d). The Fund has not been categorized\nunder the SFDR as an \u201cArticle 8\u201d or \u201cArticle\n9\u201d product.

The Independent Board\nMembers requested, and BFA provided, such\ninformation as the Independent Board Members,\nwith advice from independent counsel, deemed\nreasonably necessary to evaluate the Advisory\nAgreement. At meetings held on May 6, 2024 and\nMay 17, 2024, a committee composed of all of\nthe Independent Board Members (the \u201c15(c)\nCommittee\u201d), with independent counsel, met\nwith management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\n29 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate, and\nthat the Board would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding new or revised\nbreakpoints in the future. The Board concluded\nthat this review of potential economies of\nscale and the sharing of related benefits, as\nwell as the other factors considered at the\nmeeting, supported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 30\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)\nUnder Section 15(c) of the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a\nmajority of Board Members who are not\n\u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust (as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) (the\n\u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is required\nannually to consider the approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over\n\n31 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\ntime, including during the past year, to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business. The\nBoard also considered BFA\u2019s compliance program\nand its compliance record with respect to the\nFund, including related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund, as well as the\nresources available to them in managing the\nFund. In addition to the above considerations,\nthe Board reviewed and considered detailed\npresentations regarding BFA\u2019s investment\nperformance, investment and risk management\nprocesses and strategies provided at the May\n6, 2024 meeting and throughout the year, and\nmatters related to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance\nprogram and other compliance programs and\nservices, as well as BlackRock\u2019s continued\ninvestments in its ETF business. Based on\nreview of this information, and the\nperformance information discussed above, the\nBoard concluded that the nature, extent and\nquality of services provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the continuance of the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year. Costs of\nServices Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 32\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nsecurities, as applicable (which was included\nin the profit margins reviewed by the Board\npursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated profitability\nmethodology), payment of advisory fees or\nother fees to BFA (or its affiliates) in\nconnection with any investments by the Fund in\nother funds (including cash sweep vehicles)\nfor which BFA (or its affiliates) provides\ninvestment advisory services or other\nservices, and BlackRock\u2019s profile in the\ninvestment community. The Board further\nconsidered other direct benefits that might\naccrue to BFA, including actual and potential\nreductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses that are\nborne by BFA under the \u201call-inclusive\u201d\nmanagement fee arrangement, due in part to the\nsize and scope of BFA\u2019s investment operations\nservicing the Fund (and other funds in the\niShares complex) as well as in response to a\nchanging market environment. The Board also\nreviewed and considered information provided\nby BFA concerning authorized participant\nprimary market order processing services that\nare provided by BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, and paid for by\nauthorized participants under the ETF\nServicing Platform. The Board also noted the\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\npursuant to an agreement that permits a\nservice provider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\n33 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                      \n        Portfolio Abbreviation        \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares             \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust  \n                                      \nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report 34\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF       DiversificationClassifi\u2026  \n  MSCI Denmark      Non-diversified           \n  MSCI Finland      Non-diversified           \n  MSCI Ireland      Non-diversified           \n  MSCI Kuwait       Non-diversified           \n  MSCI New Zealand  Non-diversified           \n  MSCI Norway       Non-diversified           \n                                              \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Bank Overdraft: Certain\nFunds had outstanding cash disbursements\nexceeding deposited cash amounts at the\ncustodian during the reporting period. The\nFunds are obligated to repay the custodian for\nany overdraft, including any related costs or\nexpenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatements of Operations. Collateralization:\nIf required by an exchange or counterparty\nagreement, the Funds may be required to\ndeliver/deposit cash and/or securities to/with\nan exchange, or broker-dealer or custodian as\ncollateral for certain investments.\n\n33 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nIn-kind Redemptions: For financial reporting\npurposes, in-kind redemptions are treated as\nsales of securities resulting in realized\ncapital gains or losses to the Funds. Because\nsuch gains or losses are not taxable to the\nFunds and are not distributed to existing Fund\nshareholders, the gains or losses are\nreclassified from accumulated net realized\ngain (loss) to paid-in capital at the end of\nthe Funds\u2019 tax year. These reclassifications\nhave no effect on net assets or net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share. Distributions:\nDividends and distributions paid by each Fund\nare recorded on the ex-dividend dates.\nDistributions are determined on a tax basis\nand may differ from net investment income and\nnet realized capital gains for financial\nreporting purposes. Dividends and\ndistributions are paid in U.S. dollars and\ncannot be automatically reinvested in\nadditional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business\nday, the Funds use current market factors\nsupplied by independent pricing services to\nvalue certain foreign instruments (\u201cSystematic\nFair Value Price\u201d). The Systematic Fair Value\nPrice is designed to value such foreign\nsecurities at fair value as of the close of\ntrading on the NYSE, which follows the close\nof the local markets. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 34\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. As of period end, the following\ntable is a summary of the securities on loan\nby counterparty which are subject to offset\nunder an MSLA:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Securi\u2026           Non-Ca\u2026           \n  ETF     Loaned\u2026     Cash  Collat\u2026  Net      \n  and       Value  Collat\u2026  at Fair  Amount   \n  Count\u2026                    Value(\u2026           \n  MSCI                                        \n  Denma\u2026                                      \n  Morgan  $4,871\u2026  $(4,87\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  Stanl\u2026                                      \n  MSCI                                        \n  Finla\u2026                                      \n  Goldm\u2026                                      \n  Sachs   $16,607  $(16,6\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  & Co.                                       \n  LLC                                         \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan      799     -799  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  UBS AG    2,950   -2,950  \u2014        \u2014        \n          $20,356  $(20,3\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  MSCI                                        \n  Norway                                      \n  BNP                                         \n  Parib\u2026  $41,921  $(41,9\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  SA                                          \n  BofA                                        \n  Secur\u2026  132,059  -132,0\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Inc.                                        \n  Citig\u2026                                      \n  Global   10,569  -10,569  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Marke\u2026                                      \n  Inc.                                        \n  Goldm\u2026                                      \n  Sachs   237,385  -237,3\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  & Co.                                       \n  LLC                                         \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan    2,703   -2,703  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  Morgan   35,224  -35,224  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Stanl\u2026                                      \n  State                                       \n  Street                                      \n  Bank &  569,324  -569,3\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Trust                                       \n  Co.                                         \n          $1,029\u2026  $(1,02\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Collateral received, if any, in        \n       excess of the market value of          \n       securities on loan is not presented    \n  (a)  in this table.

To mitigate\nthese risks, each Fund benefits from a\nborrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund.\n\n35 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Futures\nContracts: Futures contracts are purchased or\nsold to gain exposure to, or manage exposure\nto, changes in interest rates (interest rate\nrisk) and changes in the value of equity\nsecurities (equity risk) or foreign currencies\n(foreign currency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Trust\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date of these financial\nstatements, all of which are subject to\nchange, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV. U.S. GAAP\nrequires that certain components of net assets\nbe adjusted to reflect permanent differences\nbetween financial and tax reporting.

LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the Funds did not\nborrow under the Syndicated Credit Agreement.\n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nValuation Risk: The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests. Counterparty Credit Risk: The\nFunds may be exposed to counterparty credit\nrisk, or the risk that an entity may fail to\nor be unable to perform on its commitments\nrelated to unsettled or open transactions,\nincluding making timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract.\n\n39 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nWith exchange-traded futures, there is less\ncounterparty credit risk to the Funds since\nthe exchange or clearinghouse, as counterparty\nto such instruments, guarantees against a\npossible default. The clearinghouse stands\nbetween the buyer and the seller of the\ncontract; therefore, credit risk is limited to\nfailure of the clearinghouse. While offset\nrights may exist under applicable law, a Fund\ndoes not have a contractual right of offset\nagainst a clearing broker or clearinghouse in\nthe event of a default (including the\nbankruptcy or insolvency). Additionally,\ncredit risk exists in exchange-traded futures\nwith respect to initial and variation margin\nthat is held in a clearing broker\u2019s customer\naccounts. While clearing brokers are required\nto segregate customer margin from their own\nassets, in the event that a clearing broker\nbecomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy and\nat that time there is a shortfall in the\naggregate amount of margin held by the\nclearing broker for all its clients, typically\nthe shortfall would be allocated on a pro rata\nbasis across all the clearing broker\u2019s\ncustomers, potentially resulting in losses to\nthe Funds. Geographic/Asset Class Risk: A\ndiversified portfolio, where this is\nappropriate and consistent with a fund\u2019s\nobjectives, minimizes the risk that a price\nchange of a particular investment will have a\nmaterial impact on the NAV of a fund. The\ninvestment concentrations within each Fund\u2019s\nportfolio are disclosed in its Schedule of\nInvestments. Certain Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in issuers\nlocated in a single country or a limited\nnumber of countries. When a fund concentrates\nits investments in this manner, it assumes the\nrisk that economic, regulatory, political and\nsocial conditions in that country or those\ncountries may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. Investment\npercentages in specific countries are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nCertain Funds invest a significant portion of\ntheir assets in securities of issuers located\nin Europe or with significant exposure to\nEuropean issuers or countries. The European\nfinancial markets have recently experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns in, or rising\ngovernment debt levels of, several European\ncountries as well as acts of war in the\nregion. These events may spread to other\ncountries in Europe and may affect the value\nand liquidity of certain of the Funds\u2019\ninvestments. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not work, may result in\nsocial unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and others of\ntheir debt could have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. The United\nKingdom has withdrawn from the European Union,\nand one or more other countries may withdraw\nfrom the European Union and/or abandon the\nEuro, the common currency of the European\nUnion. These events and actions have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely\naffect , the value and exchange rate of the\nEuro and may continue to significantly affect\nthe economies of every country in Europe,\nincluding countries that do not use the Euro\nand non-European Union member states. The\nimpact of these actions, especially if they\noccur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear\nbut could be significant and far reaching. In\naddition, Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions in the region are\nimpossible to predict, but have been, and may\ncontinue to be, significant and have a severe\nadverse effect on the region, including\nsignificant negative impacts on the economy\nand the markets for certain securities and\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors. Certain Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in\nsecurities within a single or limited number\nof market sectors. When a fund concentrates\nits investments in this manner, it assumes the\nrisk that economic, regulatory, political and\nsocial conditions affecting such sectors may\nhave a significant impact on the fund and\ncould affect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio. Investment\npercentages in specific sectors are presented\nin the Schedule of Investments. Significant\nShareholder Redemption Risk: Certain\nshareholders may own or manage a substantial\namount of fund shares and/or hold their fund\ninvestments for a limited period of time.\nLarge redemptions of fund shares by these\nshareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany, the Trust\u2019s administrator, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\nshares sold in the table above. To the extent\napplicable, to facilitate the timely\nsettlement of orders for Funds using a\nclearing facility outside of the continuous\nnet settlement process, the Funds, at their\nsole discretion, may permit an Authorized\nParticipant to post cash as collateral in\nanticipation of the delivery of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, as further described in\nthe applicable Authorized Participant\nAgreement. The collateral process is subject\nto a Control Agreement among the Authorized\nParticipant, each Funds\u2019 custodian, and the\nFunds. In the event that the Authorized\nParticipant fails to deliver all or a portion\nof the applicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, the Funds may exercise control\nover such collateral pursuant to the terms of\nthe Control Agreement in order to purchase the\napplicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities. From time to time, settlement of\nsecurities related to in-kind contributions or\nin-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 12. FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX\nCLAIMS During the period, the iShares MSCI\nFinland ETF filed a closing agreement with the\nIRS related to the recovery of foreign taxes\nreceived in fiscal year 2020, and the related\ntax compliance fee, including interest, was\npaid to the IRS. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement\u2019s evaluation of the impact of all\nsubsequent events on the Funds\u2019 financial\nstatements was completed through the date the\nfinancial statements were available to be\nissued and the following item was noted:\nEffective October 16, 2024, the Syndicated\nCredit Agreement to which the Participating\nFunds are party was amended to extend the\nmaturity date to October 15, 2025 under the\nsame terms.\n\n41 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Trustees of\niShares Trust and Shareholders of each of the\nsix funds listed in the table below Opinions\non the Financial Statements We have audited\nthe accompanying statements of assets and\nliabilities, including the schedules of\ninvestments, of each of the funds listed in\nthe table below (six of the funds constituting\niShares Trust, hereafter collectively referred\nto as the \"Funds\") as of August 31, 2024, the\nrelated statements of operations for the year\nended August 31, 2024, the statements of\nchanges in net assets for each of the two\nyears in the period ended August 31, 2024,\nincluding the related notes, and the financial\nhighlights for each of the periods indicated\ntherein (collectively referred to as the\n\u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Funds in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. Our procedures\nincluded confirmation of securities owned as\nof August 31, 2024 by correspondence with the\ncustodian, transfer agent and brokers; when\nreplies were not received from brokers, we\nperformed other auditing procedures. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 24, 2024 We have served as the auditor\nof one or more BlackRock investment companies\nsince 2000.\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm 42\n\nImportant Tax Information (unaudited)\n\nThe following amounts, or maximum amounts\nallowable by law, are hereby designated as\nqualified dividend income for individuals for\nthe fiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF       Qualified DividendIncome  \n  MSCI Denmark                    $5,406,605  \n  MSCI Finland                     1,153,804  \n  MSCI Ireland                     2,233,966  \n  MSCI New Zealand                 3,673,464  \n  MSCI Norway                      1,864,175  \n                                              \nThe Funds intend to pass through to their\nshareholders the following amounts, or maximum\namounts allowable by law, of foreign source\nincome earned and foreign taxes paid for the\nfiscal year ended August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                      Foreign   ForeignTaxes  \n  iShares ETF    SourceIncome           Paid  \n                       Earned                 \n  MSCI Denmark     $5,436,141       $691,604  \n  MSCI Finland        996,276              \u2014  \n  MSCI Ireland      2,412,361         38,337  \n  MSCI Kuwait       3,968,975              \u2014  \n  MSCI New          3,928,504        517,040  \n  Zealand                                     \n  MSCI Norway       2,059,921        428,935  \n                                              \n43 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPremium/Discount Information Information on\nthe Fund's net asset value, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads\ncan be found at iShares.com .

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\n45 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates\nmanage Other Accounts with substantially the\nsame investment objective and strategy as the\nFund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 46\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Finland ETF, iShares MSCI Kuwait\nETF (each the \u201cFund\u201d) Under Section 15(c) of\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940\nAct\u201d), the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority of Board\nMembers who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of\nthe Trust (as that term is defined in the 1940\nAct) (the \u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is\nrequired annually to consider the approval of\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over\n\n47 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\ntime, including during the past year, to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business. The\nBoard also considered BFA\u2019s compliance program\nand its compliance record with respect to the\nFund, including related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund, as well as the\nresources available to them in managing the\nFund. In addition to the above considerations,\nthe Board reviewed and considered detailed\npresentations regarding BFA\u2019s investment\nperformance, investment and risk management\nprocesses and strategies provided at the May\n6, 2024 meeting and throughout the year, and\nmatters related to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance\nprogram and other compliance programs and\nservices, as well as BlackRock\u2019s continued\ninvestments in its ETF business. Based on\nreview of this information, and the\nperformance information discussed above, the\nBoard concluded that the nature, extent and\nquality of services provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the continuance of the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year. Costs of\nServices Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 48\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nsecurities, as applicable (which was included\nin the profit margins reviewed by the Board\npursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated profitability\nmethodology), payment of advisory fees or\nother fees to BFA (or its affiliates) in\nconnection with any investments by the Fund in\nother funds (including cash sweep vehicles)\nfor which BFA (or its affiliates) provides\ninvestment advisory services or other\nservices, and BlackRock\u2019s profile in the\ninvestment community. The Board further\nconsidered other direct benefits that might\naccrue to BFA, including actual and potential\nreductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses that are\nborne by BFA under the \u201call-inclusive\u201d\nmanagement fee arrangement, due in part to the\nsize and scope of BFA\u2019s investment operations\nservicing the Fund (and other funds in the\niShares complex) as well as in response to a\nchanging market environment. The Board also\nreviewed and considered information provided\nby BFA concerning authorized participant\nprimary market order processing services that\nare provided by BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, and paid for by\nauthorized participants under the ETF\nServicing Platform. The Board also noted the\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\npursuant to an agreement that permits a\nservice provider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Ireland ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Under\nSection 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of\n1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's Board of\nTrustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority\nof Board Members who are not \u201cinterested\npersons\u201d of the Trust (as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act) (the \u201cIndependent Board\nMembers\u201d), is required annually to consider\nthe approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between the Trust and BFA (the\n\u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on behalf of the Fund.\nThe Board\u2019s consideration entails a year-long\nprocess whereby the Board and its committees\n(composed solely of Independent Board Members)\nassess BlackRock\u2019s services to the Fund,\nincluding investment management; fund\naccounting; administrative and shareholder\nservices; oversight of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders; risk management and oversight; and\nlegal and compliance services; including the\nability to meet applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements. The Independent Board\nMembers requested, and BFA provided, such\ninformation as the Independent Board Members,\nwith advice from independent counsel, deemed\nreasonably necessary to evaluate the Advisory\nAgreement. At meetings held on May 6, 2024 and\nMay 17, 2024, a committee composed of all of\nthe Independent Board Members (the \u201c15(c)\nCommittee\u201d), with independent counsel, met\nwith management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel.

The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods.\n\n49 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBased on this review, the other relevant\nfactors and information considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024 meeting and\nthroughout the year, and matters related to\nBFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program and other\ncompliance programs and services, as well as\nBlackRock\u2019s continued investments in its ETF\nbusiness. Based on review of this information,\nand the performance information discussed\nabove, the Board concluded that the nature,\nextent and quality of services provided to the\nFund under the Advisory Agreement supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year. Costs\nof Services Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 50\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBFA and its affiliates do not manage Other\nAccounts with substantially the same\ninvestment objective and strategy as the Fund\nand that track the same index as the Fund. The\nBoard also acknowledged management\u2019s assertion\nthat, for certain iShares funds, and for\nclient segmentation purposes, BlackRock has\nlaunched an iShares fund that may provide a\nsimilar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates pursuant to an agreement that\npermits a service provider to use certain\nportions of BlackRock\u2019s technology platform to\nservice accounts managed by BFA and/or its\naffiliates, including the iShares funds. The\nBoard noted that BFA generally does not use\nsoft dollars or consider the value of research\nor other services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI New Zealand ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)\nUnder Section 15(c) of the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a\nmajority of Board Members who are not\n\u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust (as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) (the\n\u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is required\nannually to consider the approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund\n\n51 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nin all instances. The Board also noted that\nthe investment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were higher than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024 meeting and\nthroughout the year, and matters related to\nBFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program and other\ncompliance programs and services, as well as\nBlackRock\u2019s continued investments in its ETF\nbusiness. Based on review of this information,\nand the performance information discussed\nabove, the Board concluded that the nature,\nextent and quality of services provided to the\nFund under the Advisory Agreement supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year. Costs\nof Services Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement.

The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community.

The\nBoard noted that BFA generally does not use\nsoft dollars or consider the value of research\nor other services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\n53 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                      \n        Portfolio Abbreviation        \n  ADR   American Depositary Receipt   \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares             \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust  \n                                      \nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report 54\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Bank Overdraft: Certain\nFunds had outstanding cash disbursements\nexceeding deposited cash amounts at the\ncustodian during the reporting period. The\nFunds are obligated to repay the custodian for\nany overdraft, including any related costs or\nexpenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatements of Operations.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 46\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nCollateralization: If required by an exchange\nor counterparty agreement, the Funds may be\nrequired to deliver/deposit cash and/or\nsecurities to/with an exchange, or broker-\ndealer or custodian as collateral for certain\ninvestments. In-kind Redemptions: For\nfinancial reporting purposes, in-kind\nredemptions are treated as sales of securities\nresulting in realized capital gains or losses\nto the Funds. Because such gains or losses are\nnot taxable to the Funds and are not\ndistributed to existing Fund shareholders, the\ngains or losses are reclassified from\naccumulated net realized gain (loss) to paid-\nin capital at the end of the Funds\u2019 tax year.\nThese reclassifications have no effect on net\nassets or net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share.\nDistributions: Dividends and distributions\npaid by each Fund are recorded on the ex-\ndividend dates. Distributions are determined\non a tax basis and may differ from net\ninvestment income and net realized capital\ngains for financial reporting purposes.\nDividends and distributions are paid in U.S.\ndollars and cannot be automatically reinvested\nin additional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\n\u2022 Swap agreements are valued utilizing quotes\nreceived daily by independent pricing services\nor through brokers, which are derived using\ndaily swap curves and models that incorporate\na number of market data factors, such as\ndiscounted cash flows, trades and values of\nthe underlying reference instruments.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business\nday, the Funds use current market factors\nsupplied by independent pricing services to\nvalue certain foreign instruments (\u201cSystematic\nFair Value Price\u201d). The Systematic Fair Value\nPrice is designed to value such foreign\nsecurities at fair value as of the close of\ntrading on the NYSE, which follows the close\nof the local markets. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and\n\n47 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2013 Unobservable inputs based on the\nbest information available in the\ncircumstances, to the extent observable inputs\nare not available, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA.

The total cash          \n       collateral received by each Fund is    \n       disclosed in the Fund\u2019sStatements of   \n       Assets and Liabilities.                \n                                              \nThe risks of securities lending include the\nrisk that the borrower may not provide\nadditional collateral when required or may not\nreturn the securities when due. To mitigate\nthese risks, each Fund benefits from a\nborrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 48\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund. 5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL\nINSTRUMENTS Futures Contracts: Futures\ncontracts are purchased or sold to gain\nexposure to, or manage exposure to, changes in\ninterest rates (interest rate risk) and\nchanges in the value of equity securities\n(equity risk) or foreign currencies (foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets. Swaps: Swap contracts are\nentered into to manage exposure to issuers,\nmarkets and securities. Such contracts are\nagreements between the Funds and a\ncounterparty to make periodic net payments on\na specified notional amount or a net payment\nupon termination. Swap agreements are\nprivately negotiated in the OTC market and may\nbe entered into as a bilateral contract (\u201cOTC\nswaps\u201d) or centrally cleared (\u201ccentrally\ncleared swaps\u201d). For OTC swaps, any upfront\npremiums paid and any upfront fees received\nare shown as swap premiums paid and swap\npremiums received, respectively, in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities and\namortized over the term of the contract. The\ndaily fluctuation in market value is recorded\nas unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on\nOTC Swaps in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Payments received or paid are\nrecorded in the Statements of Operations as\nrealized gains or losses, respectively. When\nan OTC swap is terminated, a realized gain or\nloss is recorded in the Statements of\nOperations equal to the difference between the\nproceeds from (or cost of) the closing\ntransaction and the Funds\u2019 basis in the\ncontract, if any. Generally, the basis of the\ncontract is the premium received or paid.\nTotal return swaps are entered into by the\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI World ex\nUSA ETF to obtain exposure to a security or\nmarket without owning such security or\ninvesting directly in such market or to\nexchange the risk/return of one security or\nmarket (e.g., fixed-income) with another\nsecurity or market (e.g., equity or commodity\nprices) (equity risk, commodity price risk\nand/or interest rate risk). Total return swaps\nare agreements in which there is an exchange\nof cash flows whereby one party commits to\nmake payments based on the total return\n(distributions plus capital gains/losses) of\nan underlying instrument, or basket or\nunderlying instruments, in exchange for fixed\nor floating rate interest payments. If the\ntotal return of the instruments or index\nunderlying the transaction exceeds or falls\nshort of the offsetting fixed or floating\ninterest rate obligation, the Fund receives\npayment from or makes a payment to the\ncounterparty. Certain total return swaps are\ndesigned to function as a portfolio of direct\ninvestments in long and short equity\npositions. This means that the Fund has the\nability to trade in and out of these long and\nshort positions within the swap and will\nreceive the economic benefits and risks\nequivalent to direct investment in these\npositions, subject to certain adjustments due\nto events related to the counterparty.\nBenefits and risks include capital\nappreciation (depreciation), corporate actions\nand dividends received and paid, all of which\nare reflected in the swap\u2019s market value. The\nmarket value also includes interest charges\nand credits (\u201cfinancing fees\u201d) related to the\nnotional values of the long and short\npositions and cash balances within the swap.\nThese interest charges and credits are based\non a specified benchmark rate plus or minus a\nspecified spread determined based upon the\ncountry and/or currency of the positions in\nthe portfolio. Positions within the swap and\nfinancing fees are reset periodically. During\na reset, any unrealized appreciation\n(depreciation) on positions and accrued\nfinancing fees become available for cash\nsettlement between the Fund and the\ncounterparty. The amounts that are available\nfor cash settlement are recorded as realized\ngains or losses in the Statements of\nOperations. Cash settlement in and out of the\nswap may occur at a reset date or any other\ndate, at the discretion of the Fund and the\ncounterparty, over the life of the agreement.\nCertain swaps have no stated expiration and\ncan be terminated by either party at any time.\nSwap transactions involve, to varying degrees,\nelements of interest rate, credit and market\nrisks in excess of the amounts recognized in\nthe Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Such\nrisks involve the possibility that there will\nbe no liquid market for these agreements, that\nthe counterparty to the agreements may default\non its obligation to perform or disagree as to\nthe meaning of the contractual terms in the\nagreements, and that there may be unfavorable\nchanges in interest rates and/or market values\nassociated with these transactions. Master\nNetting Arrangements: In order to define its\ncontractual rights and to secure rights that\nwill help mitigate its counterparty risk, a\nFund may enter into an International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement\n(\u201cISDA Master Agreement\u201d) or similar agreement\nwith its derivative contract counterparties.\nAn ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral\nagreement between a Fund and a counterparty\nthat governs certain OTC derivatives and\ntypically contains, among other things,\ncollateral posting terms and netting\nprovisions in the event of a default and/or\ntermination event. Under an ISDA Master\nAgreement, a Fund may, under certain\ncircumstances, offset with the\n\n49 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ncounterparty certain derivative financial\ninstruments\u2019 payables and/or receivables with\ncollateral held and/or posted and create one\nsingle net payment. The provisions of the ISDA\nMaster Agreement typically permit a single net\npayment in the event of default including the\nbankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against the\nright of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency, or\nother events. For derivatives traded under an\nISDA Master Agreement, the collateral\nrequirements are typically calculated by\nnetting the mark-to-market amount for each\ntransaction under such agreement, and\ncomparing that amount to the value of any\ncollateral currently pledged by a fund and the\ncounterparty. Cash collateral that has been\npledged to cover obligations of the Funds and\ncash collateral received from the\ncounterparty, if any, is reported separately\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as\ncash pledged as collateral and cash received\nas collateral, respectively. Non-cash\ncollateral pledged by the Funds, if any, is\nnoted in the Schedules of Investments.\nGenerally, the amount of collateral due from\nor to a counterparty is subject to a certain\nminimum transfer amount threshold before a\ntransfer is required, which is determined at\nthe close of business of the Funds. Any\nadditional required collateral is delivered\nto/pledged by the Funds on the next business\nday. Typically, the counterparty is not\npermitted to sell, re-pledge or use cash and\nnon-cash collateral it receives. A fund\ngenerally agrees not to use non-cash\ncollateral that it receives but may, absent\ndefault or certain other circumstances defined\nin the underlying ISDA Master Agreement, be\npermitted to use cash collateral received. In\nsuch cases, interest may be paid pursuant to\nthe collateral arrangement with the\ncounterparty. To the extent amounts due to the\nFunds from the counterparty are not fully\ncollateralized, each Fund bears the risk of\nloss from counterparty non-performance.\nLikewise, to the extent the Funds have\ndelivered collateral to a counterparty and\nstand ready to perform under the terms of\ntheir agreement with such counterparty, each\nFund bears the risk of loss from a\ncounterparty in the amount of the value of the\ncollateral in the event the counterparty fails\nto return such collateral. Based on the terms\nof agreements, collateral may not be required\nfor all derivative contracts. For financial\nreporting purposes, each Fund does not offset\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nthat are subject to netting arrangements, if\nany, in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 6. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT\nAND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES\nInvestment Advisory Fees: Pursuant to an\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the Trust,\nBFA manages the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets.

Pursuant to the distribution agreement,\nBFA is responsible for any fees or expenses\nfor distribution services provided to the\nFunds. Securities Lending: The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has issued\nan exemptive order which permits BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, to serve as securities\nlending agent for the Funds, subject to\napplicable conditions. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding any custodial costs. Each Fund is\nresponsible for fees in connection with the\ninvestment of cash collateral received for\nsecurities on loan (the \u201ccollateral investment\nfees\u201d). The cash collateral is invested in a\nmoney market fund, BlackRock Cash Funds:\nInstitutional or BlackRock Cash Funds:\nTreasury, managed by BFA, or its affiliates.\nHowever, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount\nof securities lending income it receives in\norder to effectively limit the collateral\ninvestment fees each Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. The SL Agency Shares of such\nmoney market fund will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. The money market fund in which\nthe cash collateral has been invested may\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee of up to\n2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 50\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nThe share of securities lending income earned\nby each Fund is shown as securities lending\nincome \u2013 affiliated \u2013 net in its Statements of\nOperations.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Trust\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and\n\n51 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect as of the date of these\nfinancial statements, all of which are subject\nto change, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV. U.S. GAAP\nrequires that certain components of net assets\nbe adjusted to reflect permanent differences\nbetween financial and tax reporting. These\nreclassifications have no effect on net assets\nor NAV per share. As of August 31, 2024,\npermanent differences attributable to realized\ngains (losses) from in-kind redemptions were\nreclassified to the following accounts:\n

LINE OF CREDIT The iShares ESG MSCI EM\nLeaders ETF, iShares MSCI Global Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals ETF and iShares MSCI Water\nManagement Multisector ETF, along with certain\nother iShares funds (\u201cParticipating Funds\u201d),\nare parties to a $800 million credit agreement\n(\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group\nof lenders, which expires on October 16, 2024.\nThe line of credit may be used for temporary\nor emergency purposes, including redemptions,\nsettlement of trades and rebalancing of\nportfolio holdings in certain target markets.\nThe Funds may borrow up to the aggregate\ncommitment amount subject to asset coverage\nand other limitations as specified in the\nSyndicated Credit Agreement. The Syndicated\nCredit Agreement has the following terms: a\ncommitment fee of 0.15% per annum on the\nunused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement.

PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nMarket Risk: Investments in the securities of\nissuers domiciled in countries with emerging\ncapital markets involve certain additional\nrisks that do not generally apply to\ninvestments in securities of issuers in more\ndeveloped capital markets, such as (i) low or\nnonexistent trading volume, resulting in a\nlack of liquidity and increased volatility in\nprices for such securities; (ii) lack of\nreliable settlement procedures and significant\ndelays in registering the transfer of\nsecurities; (iii) uncertain national policies\nand social, political and economic\ninstability, increasing the potential for\nexpropriation of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, high rates of inflation or\nunfavorable diplomatic developments; (iv) lack\nof publicly available or reliable information\nabout issuers as a result of not being subject\nto the same degree of regulatory requirements\nand accounting, auditing\n\n53 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nand financial reporting standards; and (v)\npossible fluctuations in exchange rates,\ndiffering legal systems and the existence or\npossible imposition of exchange controls,\ncustodial restrictions or other foreign or\nU.S. governmental laws or restrictions\napplicable to such investments. Valuation\nRisk: The market values of equities, such as\ncommon stocks and preferred securities or\nequity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests. The price each Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from each\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for securities that trade in thin\nor volatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation technique or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. Changes to\nsignificant unobservable inputs and\nassumptions (i.e., publicly traded company\nmultiples, growth rate, time to exit) due to\nthe lack of observable inputs may\nsignificantly impact the resulting fair value\nand therefore each Fund\u2019s results of\noperations. As a result, the price received\nupon the sale of an investment may be less\nthan the value ascribed by each Fund, and each\nFund could realize a greater than expected\nloss or lesser than expected gain upon the\nsale of the investment. Each Fund\u2019s ability to\nvalue its investments may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Counterparty Credit Risk: The Funds\nmay be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or\nthe risk that an entity may fail to or be\nunable to perform on its commitments related\nto unsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy and at that time there\nis a shortfall in the aggregate amount of\nmargin held by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. Certain Funds\ninvest a significant portion of their assets\nin issuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. Investment\npercentages in specific countries are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments. The\nFunds invest a significant portion of their\nassets in securities of issuers located in the\nUnited States. A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation and/or an economic recession in the\nUnited States may have a material adverse\neffect on the U.S. economy and the securities\nlisted on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted\npolicy and legislative changes in the United\nStates may also have a significant effect on\nU.S. markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities. Governmental\nagencies project that the United States will\ncontinue to maintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable future which may\nconstrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201cdebt ceiling.\u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. If U.S. relations\nwith certain countries deteriorate, it could\nadversely affect issuers that rely on the\nUnited States for trade. The United States has\nalso experienced increased internal unrest and\ndiscord. If these trends were to continue,\nthey may have an adverse impact on the U.S.\neconomy and the issuers in which the Funds\ninvest. Certain Funds invest a significant\nportion of their assets in securities of\nissuers located in Europe or with significant\nexposure to European issuers or countries. The\nEuropean financial markets have recently\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns in, or\nrising government debt levels of, several\nEuropean countries as well as acts of war in\nthe region. These events may spread to other\ncountries in Europe and may affect the value\nand liquidity of certain of the Funds\u2019\ninvestments.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 54\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nResponses to the financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and others of\ntheir debt could have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. The United\nKingdom has withdrawn from the European Union,\nand one or more other countries may withdraw\nfrom the European Union and/or abandon the\nEuro, the common currency of the European\nUnion. These events and actions have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely\naffect , the value and exchange rate of the\nEuro and may continue to significantly affect\nthe economies of every country in Europe,\nincluding countries that do not use the Euro\nand non-European Union member states. The\nimpact of these actions, especially if they\noccur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear\nbut could be significant and far reaching. In\naddition, Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions in the region are\nimpossible to predict, but have been, and may\ncontinue to be, significant and have a severe\nadverse effect on the region, including\nsignificant negative impacts on the economy\nand the markets for certain securities and\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors. Certain Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in China or with\nsignificant exposure to Chinese issuers.\nInvestments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed securities, involve\nrisks specific to China. China may be subject\nto considerable degrees of economic, political\nand social instability and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets.\nChinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with other neighboring\ncountries may disrupt economic development in\nChina and result in a greater risk of currency\nfluctuations, currency non-convertibility,\ninterest rate fluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation. Incidents involving China\u2019s or the\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and a fund\u2019s investments.\nReduction in spending on Chinese products and\nservices, supply chain diversification,\ninstitution of tariffs, sanctions or other\ntrade barriers, or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.\nIn addition, measures may be taken to limit\nthe flow of capital and/or sanctions may be\nimposed, which could prohibit or restrict the\nability to own or transfer fund assets and may\nalso include retaliatory actions, such as\nseizure of fund assets. Certain Funds invest a\nsignificant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in Asia or with\nsignificant exposure to Asian issuers or\ncountries. The Asian financial markets have\nrecently experienced volatility and adverse\ntrends due to concerns in several Asian\ncountries regarding monetary policy,\ngovernment intervention in the markets, rising\ngovernment debt levels or economic downturns.\nThese events may spread to other countries in\nAsia and may affect the value and liquidity of\ncertain of the Funds\u2019 investments. Certain\nFunds invest a significant portion of their\nassets in securities within a single or\nlimited number of market sectors. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions affecting such\nsectors may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nInvestment percentages in specific sectors are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nSignificant Shareholder Redemption Risk:\nCertain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany, the Trust\u2019s administrator, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\nshares sold in the table above. To the extent\napplicable, to facilitate the timely\nsettlement of orders for Funds using a\nclearing facility outside of the continuous\nnet settlement process, the Funds, at their\nsole discretion, may permit an Authorized\nParticipant to post cash as collateral in\nanticipation of the delivery of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, as further described in\nthe applicable Authorized Participant\nAgreement. The collateral process is subject\nto a Control Agreement among the Authorized\nParticipant, each Funds\u2019 custodian, and the\nFunds. In the event that the Authorized\nParticipant fails to deliver all or a portion\nof the applicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, the Funds may exercise control\nover such collateral pursuant to the terms of\nthe Control Agreement in order to purchase the\napplicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities. From time to time, settlement of\nsecurities related to in-kind contributions or\nin-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 12. FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX\nCLAIMS Certain of the outstanding foreign tax\nreclaims are not deemed by the Funds to meet\nthe recognition criteria under U.S. GAAP as of\nAugust 31, 2024 and have not been recorded in\nthe applicable Fund\u2019s net asset value. The\nrecognition by the Funds of these amounts\nwould have a positive impact on the applicable\nFund's performance. If a Fund receives a tax\nrefund that has not been previously recorded,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time the claim is\nsuccessful will benefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors who sold\ntheir shares prior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase. The Internal\nRevenue Service (\"IRS\") has issued guidance to\naddress U.S. income tax liabilities\nattributable to fund shareholders resulting\nfrom the recovery of foreign taxes withheld in\nprior calendar years. These withheld foreign\ntaxes were passed through to shareholders in\nthe form of foreign tax credits in the year\nthe taxes were withheld. Assuming there are\nsufficient foreign taxes paid which each of\nthe iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF and\niShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF is able to\npass through to its shareholders as a foreign\ntax credit in the current year, each of the\nFunds will be able to offset the prior years\u2019\nwithholding taxes recovered against the\nforeign taxes paid in the current year.\nAccordingly, no federal income tax liability\nis recorded by the Funds. 13.

Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on the Funds\u2019 financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Funds in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. Our procedures\nincluded confirmation of securities owned as\nof August 31, 2024 by correspondence with the\ncustodian, transfer agent and brokers; when\nreplies were not received from brokers, we\nperformed other auditing procedures. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nOctober 24, 2024 We have served as the auditor\nof one or more

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was provided with\na detailed description of the proprietary ETF\nmethodology used by Broadridge to determine\nthe Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board noted that,\ndue to the limitations in providing comparable\nfunds in the Peer Group, the statistical\ninformation provided in Broadridge\u2019s report\nmay or may not provide meaningful direct\ncomparisons to the Fund in all instances. The\nBoard also noted that the investment advisory\nfee rate and overall expenses (net of any\nwaivers and reimbursements) for the Fund were\nlower than the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds. In addition, to the extent that any of\nthe comparison funds included in the Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds, track the same\nindex as the Fund, Broadridge also provided,\nand the Board reviewed, a comparison of the\nFund\u2019s performance for the one-year, three-\nyear, five-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods.The Board noted that the Fund seeks to\ntrack its specified underlying index and that,\nduring the year, the Board received periodic\nreports on the Fund\u2019s short- and longer-term\nperformance in comparison with its underlying\nindex.Such periodic comparative performance\ninformation, including additional detailed\ninformation as requested by the Board, was\nalso considered.The Board noted that the Fund\ngenerally performed in line with its\nunderlying index over the relevant periods.\nBased on this review, the other relevant\nfactors and information considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\n61 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase.However, the Board\nnoted that it would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund.The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 62\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development\nGoals ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Under Section 15(c) of\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940\nAct\u201d), the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority of Board\nMembers who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of\nthe Trust (as that term is defined in the 1940\nAct) (the \u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is\nrequired annually to consider the approval of\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was provided with\na detailed description of the proprietary ETF\nmethodology used by Broadridge to determine\nthe Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board noted that,\ndue to the limitations in providing comparable\nfunds in the Peer Group, the statistical\ninformation provided in Broadridge\u2019s report\nmay or may not provide meaningful direct\ncomparisons to the Fund in all instances. The\nBoard also noted that the investment advisory\nfee rate and overall expenses (net of any\nwaivers and reimbursements) for the Fund were\nwithin range of the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds. In addition, to the extent that any of\nthe comparison funds included in the Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds, track the same\nindex as the Fund, Broadridge also provided,\nand the Board reviewed, a comparison of the\nFund\u2019s performance for the one-year, three-\nyear, five-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over\n\n63 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\ntime, including during the past year, to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business. The\nBoard also considered BFA\u2019s compliance program\nand its compliance record with respect to the\nFund, including related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund, as well as the\nresources available to them in managing the\nFund. In addition to the above considerations,\nthe Board reviewed and considered detailed\npresentations regarding BFA\u2019s investment\nperformance, investment and risk management\nprocesses and strategies provided at the May\n6, 2024 meeting and throughout the year, and\nmatters related to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance\nprogram and other compliance programs and\nservices, as well as BlackRock\u2019s continued\ninvestments in its ETF business. Based on\nreview of this information, and the\nperformance information discussed above, the\nBoard concluded that the nature, extent and\nquality of services provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the continuance of the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year. Costs of\nServices Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 64\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nsecurities, as applicable (which was included\nin the profit margins reviewed by the Board\npursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated profitability\nmethodology), payment of advisory fees or\nother fees to BFA (or its affiliates) in\nconnection with any investments by the Fund in\nother funds (including cash sweep vehicles)\nfor which BFA (or its affiliates) provides\ninvestment advisory services or other\nservices, and BlackRock\u2019s profile in the\ninvestment community. The Board further\nconsidered other direct benefits that might\naccrue to BFA, including actual and potential\nreductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses that are\nborne by BFA under the \u201call-inclusive\u201d\nmanagement fee arrangement, due in part to the\nsize and scope of BFA\u2019s investment operations\nservicing the Fund (and other funds in the\niShares complex) as well as in response to a\nchanging market environment. The Board also\nreviewed and considered information provided\nby BFA concerning authorized participant\nprimary market order processing services that\nare provided by BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, and paid for by\nauthorized participants under the ETF\nServicing Platform. The Board also noted the\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\npursuant to an agreement that permits a\nservice provider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI World ex\nUSA ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Under Section 15(c) of\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940\nAct\u201d), the Trust\u2019s Board of Trustees (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority of Board\nMembers who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of\nthe Trust (as that term is defined in the 1940\nAct) (the \u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is\nrequired to consider the approval of the\nproposed Investment Advisory Agreement between\nthe Trust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d)\non behalf of the Fund. The Independent Board\nMembers requested, and BFA provided, such\ninformation as the Independent Board Members,\nwith advice from independent counsel, deemed\nreasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of\nthe proposed Advisory Agreement. At a meeting\nheld on December 12-14, 2023, the Board,\nincluding the Independent Board Members,\napproved the selection of BFA as investment\nadviser and approved the proposed Advisory\nAgreement for the Fund, based on a review of\nqualitative and quantitative information\nprovided by BFA. The Board also considered\ninformation previously provided by BFA,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.\n(\u201cBTC\u201d), and BlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d), as\napplicable, at prior Board meetings. The\nIndependent Board Members were advised by\ntheir independent counsel throughout the\nprocess, including about the legal standards\napplicable to their review. In approving the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, the Board,\nincluding the Independent Board Members,\nconsidered various factors, including: (i) the\nexpenses of the Fund; (ii) the nature, extent\nand quality of the services to be provided by\nBFA; (iii) the costs of services to be\nprovided to the Fund and the availability of\ninformation related to profits to be realized\nby BFA and its affiliates; (iv) potential\neconomies of scale; (v) the fees and services\nprovided for other comparable funds/accounts\nmanaged by BFA and its affiliates; and (vi)\nother benefits to BFA and/or its affiliates.\nThe material factors, no one of which was\ncontrolling, and conclusions that formed the\nbasis for the Board, including the Independent\nBoard Members, to approve the Advisory\nAgreement are discussed below. Expenses of the\nFund: The Board reviewed statistical\ninformation prepared by Broadridge Financial\nSolutions Inc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent\nprovider of investment company data, regarding\nthe expense ratio components of the Fund in\ncomparison with the same information for other\nETFs, objectively selected by Broadridge as\ncomprising the Fund\u2019s applicable expense peer\ngroup pursuant to Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF\nmethodology (the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was\nprovided with a detailed description of the\nproprietary ETF methodology used by Broadridge\nto determine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that due to the limitations in providing\ncomparable funds in the Peer Group, the\nstatistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. Based on this\nreview, the other factors considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nof the Fund supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Nature, Extent and\nQuality of Services to be Provided by BFA: The\nBoard reviewed the scope of services to be\nprovided by BFA under the Advisory Agreement.\nIn reviewing the scope of these services, the\nBoard considered BFA\u2019s investment philosophy\nand experience, noting that BFA and its\naffiliates have committed significant\nresources over time and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders. The Board considered\nrepresentations by BFA, BTC, and BlackRock\nthat the scope and quality of services to be\nprovided to the Fund would be similar to the\nscope and quality of services provided to\nother iShares funds.The Board also considered\nBFA\u2019s compliance program and its compliance\nrecord with respect to other iShares funds\nincluding related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons who will be responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the Fund, as well as the\nresources that will be available to them in\nmanaging the Fund. The Board also considered\ndetailed presentations regarding BFA\u2019s\ninvestment performance, investment and risk\nmanagement processes and strategies, which\nwere provided throughout the year with respect\nto other iShares funds, and other matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services.\nBased on review of this information, the Board\nconcluded that the nature, extent and quality\nof services to be provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the Advisory Agreement.\n\n65 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nCosts of Services to be Provided to the Fund\nand Profits to be Realized by BFA and\nAffiliates: The Board did not consider the\nprofitability of the Fund to BFA based on the\nfees payable under the Advisory Agreement or\nrevenue to be received by BFA or its\naffiliates in connection with services to be\nprovided to the Fund since the proposed\nrelationship had not yet commenced. The Board\nnoted that it expects to receive profitability\ninformation from BFA periodically following\nthe Fund\u2019s launch and will thus be in a\nposition to evaluate whether any new or\nadditional breakpoints or other adjustments in\nFund fees would be appropriate. Economies of\nScale: The Board considered information that\nit had previously received regarding potential\neconomies of scale, efficiencies and scale\nbenefits shared with the iShares funds through\nrelatively low fee rates established at\ninception, breakpoints, waivers, or other fee\nreductions, as well as through additional\ninvestment in the iShares business and the\nprovision of improved or additional\ninfrastructure and services to the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders. The Board noted\nthat the Advisory Agreement for the Fund did\nnot provide for any breakpoints in the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment advisory fee rate as the assets of\nthe Fund increase. However, the Board noted\nthat it would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding breakpoints in the\nfuture. This consideration of potential\neconomies of scale and the sharing of related\nbenefits, as well as the other factors\nconsidered at the meeting, supported the\nBoard\u2019s approval of the Advisory Agreement.\nFees and Services Provided for Other\nComparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA and\nits Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds, and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board acknowledged BFA\u2019s representation\nthat the iShares funds are fundamentally\ndifferent investment vehicles from the Other\nAccounts. The Board noted that BFA and its\naffiliates do not manage Other Accounts with\nsubstantially the same investment objective\nand strategy as the Fund and that track the\nsame index as the Fund. The Board further\nnoted that BFA previously provided the Board\nwith detailed information regarding how the\nOther Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) generally differ from the iShares\nfunds, including in terms of the different and\ngenerally more extensive services provided to\nthe iShares funds, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board considered\nthe \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the Fund\u2019s\nadvisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement.\nOther Benefits to BFA and/or its Affiliates:\nExcept as noted below, the Board did not\nconsider the \u201cfallout\u201d benefits or ancillary\nrevenue to be received by BFA and/or its\naffiliates in connection with the services to\nbe provided to the Fund by BFA since the\nproposed relationship had not yet commenced.\nHowever, the Board considered the potential\npayment of advisory fees and/or administration\nfees to BFA (or its affiliates) in connection\nwith any investments by the Fund in other\nfunds for which BFA (or its affiliates)\nprovides investment advisory services and/or\nadministration services. The Board further\nconsidered other direct benefits that might\naccrue to BFA, including the potential for\nreduction in the Fund\u2019s expenses that are\nborne by BFA under the \u201call-inclusive\u201d\nmanagement fee arrangement, due in part to the\nsize and scope of BFA\u2019s investment operations\nservicing the Fund (and other funds in the\niShares complex) as well as in response to a\nchanging market environment. The Board also\nnoted the potential revenue to be received by\nBFA and/or its affiliates pursuant to an\nagreement that would permit a service provider\nto use certain portions of BlackRock\u2019s\ntechnology platform to service accounts\nmanaged by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board also\nconsidered the potential for revenue to BTC,\nthe Fund\u2019s securities lending agent, and its\naffiliates in the event of any loaning of\nportfolio securities of the Fund. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that will be provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nnoted that BFA generally does not use soft\ndollars or consider the value of research or\nother services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the Advisory\nAgreement. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services to\nbe rendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the Advisory Agreement.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 66\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                              \n       Currency Abbreviation  \n  SAR  Saudi Riyal            \n                              \n                                       \n        Portfolio Abbreviation         \n  ADR   American Depositary Receipt    \n  JSC   Joint Stock Company            \n  NVDR  Non-Voting Depositary Receipt  \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares              \n  PJSC  Public Joint Stock Company     \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust   \n                                       \n67 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF           DiversificationClas\u2026  \n  Currency Hedged MSCI  Diversified           \n  Eurozone                                    \n  Currency Hedged MSCI  Diversified           \n  Japan                                       \n                                              \nCurrently each Fund seeks to achieve its\ninvestment objective by investing a\nsubstantial portion of its assets in an\niShares fund (an \u201cunderlying fund\u201d). The\nfinancial statements, including the accounting\npolicies, and schedules of investments for the\nunderlying funds are available on iShares.com\nand should be read in conjunction with the\nFunds\u2019 financial statements. 2. SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements\nare prepared in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may\nrequire management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities in the financial\nstatements, disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions from the\nunderlying funds, if any, are recorded on the\nex-dividend date. Interest income is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. However,\neach Fund has elected to treat realized gains\n(losses) from certain foreign currency\ncontracts as capital gain (loss) for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Bank Overdraft:\nCertain Funds had outstanding cash\ndisbursements exceeding deposited cash amounts\nat the custodian during the reporting period.\nThe Funds are obligated to repay the custodian\nfor any overdraft, including any related costs\nor expenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatements of Operations. Collateralization:\nIf required by an exchange or counterparty\nagreement, the Funds may be required to\ndeliver/deposit cash and/or securities to/with\nan exchange, or broker-dealer or custodian as\ncollateral for certain investments. In-kind\nRedemptions: For financial reporting purposes,\nin-kind redemptions are treated as sales of\nsecurities resulting in realized capital gains\nor losses to the Funds. Because such gains or\nlosses are not taxable to the Funds and are\nnot distributed to existing Fund shareholders,\nthe gains or losses are reclassified from\naccumulated net realized gain (loss) to paid-\nin capital at the end of the Funds\u2019 tax year.\nThese reclassifications have no effect on net\nassets or net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share.\nDistributions: Dividends and distributions\npaid by each Fund are recorded on the ex-\ndividend dates. Distributions are determined\non a tax basis and may differ from net\ninvestment income and net realized capital\ngains for financial reporting purposes.\nDividends and distributions are paid in U.S.\ndollars and cannot be automatically reinvested\nin additional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty.\n\n17 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n3. INVESTMENT VALUATION AND FAIR VALUE\nMEASUREMENTS Investment Valuation Policies:\nEach Fund\u2019s investments are valued at fair\nvalue (also referred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d\nwithin the financial statements) each day that\nthe Fund\u2019s listing exchange is open and, for\nfinancial reporting purposes, as of the report\ndate. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the\nprice a fund would receive to sell an asset or\npay to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The Board of Trustees of the\nTrust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved\nthe designation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Exchange-traded funds and\nclosed-end funds traded on a recognized\nsecurities exchange are valued at that day\u2019s\nofficial closing price, as applicable, on the\nexchange where the fund is primarily traded.\nFunds traded on a recognized exchange for\nwhich there were no sales on that day may be\nvalued at the last traded price. \u2022 Investments\nin open-end U.S. mutual funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at that day\u2019s\npublished NAV. \u2022 Forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts are valued at the mean\nbetween the bid and ask prices and are\ndetermined as of the close of trading on the\nNew York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) based on that\nday\u2019s prevailing forward exchange rate for the\nunderlying currencies. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 18\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nsecurities but does not receive interest\nincome on securities received as collateral.\nLoans of securities are terminable at any time\nand the borrower, after notice, is required to\nreturn borrowed securities within the standard\ntime period for settlement of securities\ntransactions. As of period end, any securities\non loan were collateralized by cash and/or\nU.S. Government obligations. Cash collateral\ninvested in money market funds managed by BFA,\nor its affiliates is disclosed in the Schedule\nof Investments. Any non-cash collateral\nreceived cannot be sold, re-invested or\npledged by the Fund, except in the event of\nborrower default. The securities on loan, if\nany, are also disclosed in each Fund\u2019s\nSchedule of Investments. The market value of\nany securities on loan and the value of any\nrelated cash collateral are disclosed in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. As of period end, the following\ntable is a summary of the securities on loan\nby counterparty which are subject to offset\nunder an MSLA:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Securi\u2026           Non-Ca\u2026           \n  ETF     Loaned\u2026     Cash  Collat\u2026  Net      \n  and       Value  Collat\u2026  at Fair  Amount   \n  Count\u2026                    Value(\u2026           \n  Curre\u2026                                      \n  Hedged                                      \n  MSCI                                        \n  Japan                                       \n  BNP                                         \n  Parib\u2026  $35,98\u2026  $(35,9\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  SA                                          \n  BofA                                        \n  Secur\u2026  45,787\u2026  -45,78\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Inc.                                        \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan  20,151\u2026  -20,15\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  UBS AG  53,775\u2026  -53,77\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n          $155,6\u2026  $(155,\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Collateral received, if any, in        \n       excess of the market value of          \n       securities on loan is not presented    \n  (a)  in this table.

To mitigate\nthese risks, each Fund benefits from a\nborrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund. 5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL\nINSTRUMENTS Forward Foreign Currency Exchange\nContracts: Forward foreign currency exchange\ncontracts are entered into to gain or reduce\nexposure to foreign currencies (foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk). A forward\nforeign currency exchange contract is an\nagreement between two parties to buy and sell\na currency at a set exchange rate on a\nspecified date. These contracts help to manage\nthe overall exposure to the currencies in\nwhich some of the investments held by the\nFunds are denominated and in some cases, may\nbe used to obtain exposure to a particular\nmarket.The contracts are traded over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) and not on an organized\nexchange. The contract is marked-to-market\ndaily and the change in market value is\nrecorded as unrealized appreciation or\ndepreciation in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. When the contract is closed, a\nrealized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the value at the time it\nwas opened and the value at the time it was\nclosed. Non-deliverable forward foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts are settled with\nthe counterparty in cash without the delivery\nof foreign currency. The use of forward\nforeign currency exchange contracts involves\nthe risk that the value of a contract changes\nunfavorably due to movements in the value of\nthe referenced foreign currencies, and such\nvalue may exceed the amount(s) reflected in\nthe Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Cash\namounts pledged for forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts are considered restricted\nand are included in cash pledged as collateral\nfor OTC derivatives in the Statements of\nAssets and Liabilities. A fund\u2019s risk of loss\nfrom counterparty credit risk on OTC\nderivatives is generally limited to the\naggregate unrealized gain netted against any\ncollateral held by the Fund. Master Netting\nArrangements: In order to define its\ncontractual rights and to secure rights that\nwill help mitigate its counterparty risk, a\nFund may enter into an International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement\n(\u201cISDA Master Agreement\u201d) or similar agreement\nwith its derivative contract counterparties.\nAn ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral\nagreement between a Fund and a counterparty\nthat governs certain OTC derivatives and\ntypically contains, among other things,\ncollateral posting terms and netting\nprovisions in the event of a default and/or\ntermination event. Under an ISDA Master\nAgreement, a Fund may, under certain\ncircumstances, offset with the counterparty\ncertain derivative financial instruments\u2019\npayables and/or receivables with collateral\nheld and/or posted and create one single net\npayment. The provisions of\n\n19 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nthe ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a\nsingle net payment in the event of default\nincluding the bankruptcy or insolvency of the\ncounterparty. However, bankruptcy or\ninsolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction\nmay impose restrictions on or prohibitions\nagainst the right of offset in bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, or other events. For derivatives\ntraded under an ISDA Master Agreement, the\ncollateral requirements are typically\ncalculated by netting the mark-to-market\namount for each transaction under such\nagreement, and comparing that amount to the\nvalue of any collateral currently pledged by a\nfund and the counterparty. Cash collateral\nthat has been pledged to cover obligations of\nthe Funds and cash collateral received from\nthe counterparty, if any, is reported\nseparately in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities as cash pledged as collateral and\ncash received as collateral, respectively.\nNon-cash collateral pledged by the Funds, if\nany, is noted in the Schedules of Investments.\nGenerally, the amount of collateral due from\nor to a counterparty is subject to a certain\nminimum transfer amount threshold before a\ntransfer is required, which is determined at\nthe close of business of the Funds. Any\nadditional required collateral is delivered\nto/pledged by the Funds on the next business\nday. Typically, the counterparty is not\npermitted to sell, re-pledge or use cash and\nnon-cash collateral it receives. A fund\ngenerally agrees not to use non-cash\ncollateral that it receives but may, absent\ndefault or certain other circumstances defined\nin the underlying ISDA Master Agreement, be\npermitted to use cash collateral received. In\nsuch cases, interest may be paid pursuant to\nthe collateral arrangement with the\ncounterparty. To the extent amounts due to the\nFunds from the counterparty are not fully\ncollateralized, each Fund bears the risk of\nloss from counterparty non-performance.\nLikewise, to the extent the Funds have\ndelivered collateral to a counterparty and\nstand ready to perform under the terms of\ntheir agreement with such counterparty, each\nFund bears the risk of loss from a\ncounterparty in the amount of the value of the\ncollateral in the event the counterparty fails\nto return such collateral. Based on the terms\nof agreements, collateral may not be required\nfor all derivative contracts. For financial\nreporting purposes, each Fund does not offset\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nthat are subject to netting arrangements, if\nany, in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 6. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT\nAND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES\nInvestment Advisory Fees: Pursuant to an\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the Trust,\nBlackRock Fund Advisors (\"BFA\") manages the\ninvestment of each Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\"BlackRock\"). Under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, except (i) interest and taxes; (ii)\nbrokerage commissions and other expenses\nconnected with the execution of portfolio\ntransactions; (iii) distribution fees; (iv)\nthe advisory fee payable to BFA; and (v)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (in each case as determined by a\nmajority of the independent trustees). For its\ninvestment advisory services to each of the\nfollowing Funds, BFA is entitled to an annual\ninvestment advisory fee, accrued daily and\npaid monthly by the Funds, based on the\naverage daily net assets of each Fund as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF            Investment Advisory  \n                                        Fees  \n  Currency Hedged                      0.62%  \n  MSCI Eurozone                               \n  Currency Hedged                       0.53  \n  MSCI Japan                                  \n                                              \nExpense Waivers: A fund may incur its pro rata\nshare of fees and expenses attributable to its\ninvestments in other investment companies\n(\u201cacquired fund fees and expenses\u201d). The total\nof the investment advisory fee and acquired\nfund fees and expenses are a fund\u2019s total\nannual operating expenses. Total expenses as\nshown in the Statement of Operations does not\ninclude acquired fund fees and expenses. For\nthe iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone ETF,\nBFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its investment advisory fee for the\nFund through December 31, 2025 so that the\nFund\u2019s total annual operating expenses after\nfee waiver is equal to the acquired fund fees\nand expenses attributable to the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF\n(\u201cEZU\u201d), after taking into account any fee\nwaivers by EZU, plus 0.03%. For the iShares\nCurrency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF, BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\ninvestment advisory fee for the Fund through\nDecember 31, 2025 in an amount equal to the\nacquired fund fees and expenses, if any,\nattributable to the Fund\u2019s investments in\nother iShares funds, provided that the waiver\nbe no greater than the Fund\u2019s investment\nadvisory fee of 0.53%. BFA has also\ncontractually agreed to waive an additional\nportion of its investment advisory fee for the\nFund through December 31, 2025 such that the\nFund\u2019s total annual operating expenses after\nfee waiver will be equal to the greater of the\nacquired fund fees and expenses or 0.48%.\nThese amounts are included in investment\nadvisory fees waived in the Statements of\nOperations. For the year ended August 31,\n2024, the amounts waived in investment\nadvisory fees pursuant to these arrangements\nwere as follows:\n                                              \n  iShares ETF                 Amounts Waived  \n  Currency Hedged MSCI            $2,278,508  \n  Eurozone                                    \n  Currency Hedged MSCI Japan       1,556,952  \n                                              \nDistributor: BlackRock Investments, LLC, an\naffiliate of BFA, is the distributor for each\nFund. Pursuant to the distribution agreement,\nBFA is responsible for any fees or expenses\nfor distribution services provided to the\nFunds. Securities Lending: The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has issued\nan exemptive order which permits BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, to serve as securities\nlending agent for the Funds, subject to\napplicable conditions. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding any custodial costs. Each Fund is\nresponsible for fees in connection with the\ninvestment of cash collateral received for\nsecurities on loan (the \u201ccollateral investment\nfees\u201d). The cash collateral is invested in a\nmoney market fund, BlackRock Cash Funds:\nInstitutional or BlackRock Cash\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 20\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nFunds: Treasury, managed by BFA, or its\naffiliates. However, BTC has agreed to reduce\nthe amount of securities lending income it\nreceives in order to effectively limit the\ncollateral investment fees each Fund bears to\nan annual rate of 0.04%. The SL Agency Shares\nof such money market fund will not be subject\nto a sales load, redemption fee, distribution\nfee or service fee. The money market fund in\nwhich the cash collateral has been invested\nmay impose a discretionary liquidity fee of up\nto 2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees. The share of\nsecurities lending income earned by each Fund\nis shown as securities lending income \u2013\naffiliated \u2013 net in its Statements of\nOperations. For the year ended August 31,\n2024, the Funds paid BTC the following amounts\nfor securities lending agent services:\n                                          \n  iShares ETF                    Amounts  \n  Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone   $3,634  \n  Currency Hedged MSCI Japan       7,707  \n                                          \nOfficers and Trustees: Certain officers and/or\ntrustees of the Trust are officers and/or\ntrustees of BlackRock or its affiliates. Other\nTransactions: Each Fund may invest its\npositive cash balances in certain money market\nfunds managed by BFA or an affiliate. The\nincome earned on these temporary cash\ninvestments is shown as dividends \u2013 affiliated\nin the Statements of Operations. 7.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Trust\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date of these financial\nstatements, all of which are subject to\nchange, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV.\n\n21 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nU.S. GAAP requires that certain components of\nnet assets be adjusted to reflect permanent\ndifferences between financial and tax\nreporting. These reclassifications have no\neffect on net assets or NAV per share.

LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the Funds did not\nborrow under the Syndicated Credit Agreement.\n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 22\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\ninstability; (iii) regulation, taxation or\ninternational tax treaties between various\ncountries; or (iv) currency, interest rate or\nprice fluctuations. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Funds\nand their investments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus\nprovides details of the risks to which the\nFund is subject. BFA uses an indexing approach\nto try to achieve each Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. The Fund is not actively managed,\nand BFA generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets.\nCounterparty Credit Risk: The Funds may be\nexposed to counterparty credit risk, or the\nrisk that an entity may fail to or be unable\nto perform on its commitments related to\nunsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. Geographic/Asset\nClass Risk: A diversified portfolio, where\nthis is appropriate and consistent with a\nfund\u2019s objectives, minimizes the risk that a\nprice change of a particular investment will\nhave a material impact on the NAV of a fund.\nThe investment concentrations within each\nFund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in its Schedule\nof Investments. Significant Shareholder\nRedemption Risk: Certain shareholders may own\nor manage a substantial amount of fund shares\nand/or hold their fund investments for a\nlimited period of time. Large redemptions of\nfund shares by these shareholders may force a\nfund to sell portfolio securities, which may\nnegatively impact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nfund\u2019s brokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany, the Trust\u2019s administrator, to offset\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units, including Creation Units for\ncash. Authorized Participants transacting in\nCreation Units for cash may also pay an\nadditional variable charge to compensate the\nrelevant fund for certain transaction costs\n(i.e., stamp taxes, taxes on currency or other\nfinancial transactions, and brokerage costs)\nand market impact expenses relating to\ninvesting in portfolio securities. Such\nvariable charges, if any, are included in\nshares sold in the table above. To the extent\napplicable, to facilitate the timely\nsettlement of orders for Funds using a\nclearing facility outside of the continuous\nnet settlement process, the Funds, at their\nsole discretion, may permit an Authorized\nParticipant to post cash as collateral in\nanticipation of the delivery of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, as further described in\nthe applicable Authorized Participant\nAgreement. The collateral process is subject\nto a Control Agreement among the Authorized\nParticipant, each Funds\u2019 custodian, and the\nFunds. In the event that the Authorized\nParticipant fails to deliver all or a portion\nof the applicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, the Funds may exercise control\nover such collateral pursuant to the terms of\nthe Control Agreement in order to purchase the\napplicable Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities. From time to time, settlement of\nsecurities related to in-kind contributions or\nin-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities.\n\n23 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n12.

We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. Our procedures\nincluded confirmation of securities owned as\nof August 31, 2024 by correspondence with the\ncustodian, transfer agent and brokers; when\nreplies were not received from brokers, we\nperformed other auditing procedures.

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was provided with\na detailed description of the proprietary ETF\nmethodology used by Broadridge to determine\nthe Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board noted that,\ndue to the limitations in providing comparable\nfunds in the Peer Group, the statistical\ninformation provided in Broadridge\u2019s report\nmay or may not provide meaningful direct\ncomparisons to the Fund in all instances. The\nBoard also noted that the investment advisory\nfee rate and overall expenses (net of any\nwaivers and reimbursements) for the Fund were\nhigher than the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds. In addition, to the extent that any of\nthe comparison funds included in the Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds, track the same\nindex as the Fund, Broadridge also provided,\nand the Board reviewed, a comparison of the\nFund\u2019s performance for the one-year, three-\nyear, five-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods.The Board noted that the Fund seeks to\ntrack its specified underlying index and that,\nduring the year, the Board received periodic\nreports on the Fund\u2019s short- and longer-term\nperformance in comparison with its underlying\nindex.Such periodic comparative performance\ninformation, including additional detailed\ninformation as requested by the Board, was\nalso considered.The Board noted that the Fund\ngenerally performed in line with its\nunderlying index over the relevant periods.\nBased on this review, the other relevant\nfactors and information considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 28\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase.However, the Board\nnoted that it would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund.The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue\n\n29 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nreceived by BFA and/or its affiliates pursuant\nto an agreement that permits a service\nprovider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 30\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                              \n       Currency Abbreviation  \n  EUR  Euro                   \n  JPY  Japanese Yen           \n  USD  United States Dollar   \n                              \n31 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\n1. ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF           DiversificationClas\u2026  \n  MSCI United Kingdom   Non-diversified       \n  MSCI United Kingdom   Diversified           \n  Small-Cap                                   \n                                              \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes. Collateralization: If\nrequired by an exchange or counterparty\nagreement, the Funds may be required to\ndeliver/deposit cash and/or securities to/with\nan exchange, or broker-dealer or custodian as\ncollateral for certain investments. In-kind\nRedemptions: For financial reporting purposes,\nin-kind redemptions are treated as sales of\nsecurities resulting in realized capital gains\nor losses to the Funds. Because such gains or\nlosses are not taxable to the Funds and are\nnot distributed to existing Fund shareholders,\nthe gains or losses are reclassified from\naccumulated net realized gain (loss) to paid-\nin capital at the end of the Funds\u2019 tax year.\nThese reclassifications have no effect on net\nassets or net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 16\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nDistributions: Dividends and distributions\npaid by each Fund are recorded on the ex-\ndividend dates. Distributions are determined\non a tax basis and may differ from net\ninvestment income and net realized capital\ngains for financial reporting purposes.\nDividends and distributions are paid in U.S.\ndollars and cannot be automatically reinvested\nin additional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the\nNYSE. Each business day, the Funds use current\nmarket factors supplied by independent pricing\nservices to value certain foreign instruments\n(\u201cSystematic Fair Value Price\u201d). The\nSystematic Fair Value Price is designed to\nvalue such foreign securities at fair value as\nof the close of trading on the NYSE, which\nfollows the close of the local markets. If\nevents (e.g., market volatility, company\nannouncement or a natural disaster) occur that\nare expected to materially affect the value of\nsuch investment, or in the event that\napplication of these methods of valuation\nresults in a price for an investment that is\ndeemed not to be representative of the market\nvalue of such investment, or if a price is not\navailable, the investment will be valued by\nthe Valuation Committee, in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value (\u201cFair Valued Investments\u201d). The\nfair valuation approaches that may be used by\nthe Valuation Committee include market\napproach, income approach and cost approach.\nValuation techniques such as discounted cash\nflow, use of market comparables and matrix\npricing are types of valuation approaches and\nare typically used in determining fair value.\nWhen determining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and \u2022 Level 3 \u2013\nUnobservable inputs based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances, to\nthe extent observable inputs are not\navailable, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities.\n\n17 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n4. SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities\nLending: Each Fund may lend its securities to\napproved borrowers, such as brokers, dealers\nand other financial institutions. The borrower\npledges and maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. As of period end, the following\ntable is a summary of the securities on loan\nby counterparty which are subject to offset\nunder an MSLA:\n                                              \n  iShar\u2026  Securi\u2026           Non-Ca\u2026           \n  ETF     Loaned\u2026     Cash  Collat\u2026  Net      \n  and       Value  Collat\u2026  at Fair  Amount   \n  Count\u2026                    Value(\u2026           \n  MSCI                                        \n  United                                      \n  Kingd\u2026                                      \n  Small\u2026                                      \n  Barcl\u2026                                      \n  Capit\u2026  $25,846  $(25,8\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n  Inc.                                        \n  J.P.                                        \n  Morgan  519,398  -519,3\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  LLC                                         \n  Morgan  111,999  -111,9\u2026  \u2014        \u2014        \n  Stanl\u2026                                      \n          $657,2\u2026  $(657,\u2026  $\u2014       $\u2014       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Collateral received, if any, in        \n       excess of the market value of          \n       securities on loan is not presented    \n  (a)  in this table. The total cash          \n       collateral received by each Fund is    \n       disclosed in the Fund\u2019sStatements of   \n       Assets and Liabilities.                \n                                              \nThe risks of securities lending include the\nrisk that the borrower may not provide\nadditional collateral when required or may not\nreturn the securities when due. To mitigate\nthese risks, each Fund benefits from a\nborrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund. 5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL\nINSTRUMENTS Futures Contracts: Futures\ncontracts are purchased or sold to gain\nexposure to, or manage exposure to, changes in\ninterest rates (interest rate risk) and\nchanges in the value of equity securities\n(equity risk) or foreign currencies (foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 18\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n6. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER\nTRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES Investment\nAdvisory Fees: Pursuant to an Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with the Trust, BFA manages\nthe investment of each Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock. Under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the Funds,\nexcept (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage\ncommissions and other expenses connected with\nthe execution of portfolio transactions; (iii)\ndistribution fees; (iv) the advisory fee\npayable to BFA; and (v) litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses (in each case\nas determined by a majority of the independent\ntrustees). For its investment advisory\nservices to the iShares MSCI United Kingdom\nETF, BFA is entitled to an annual investment\nadvisory fee, accrued daily and paid monthly\nby the Fund, based on the Fund\u2019s allocable\nportion of the aggregate of the average daily\nnet assets of the Fund and certain other\niShares funds, as follows:\n                                              \n  Aggregate Average      Investment Advisory  \n  Daily Net Assets                      Fees  \n  First $7 billion                     0.59%  \n  Over $7 billion, up                         \n  to and including                      0.54  \n  $11 billion                                 \n  Over $11 billion,                           \n  up to and including                   0.49  \n  $24 billion                                 \n  Over $24 billion,                           \n  up to and including                   0.44  \n  $48 billion                                 \n  Over $48 billion,                           \n  up to and including                   0.40  \n  $72 billion                                 \n  Over $72 billion,                           \n  up to and including                   0.36  \n  $96 billion                                 \n  Over $96 billion                      0.32  \n                                              \nFor its investment advisory services to the\niShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF, BFA\nis entitled to an annual investment advisory\nfee of 0.59%, accrued daily and paid monthly\nby the Fund, based on the average daily net\nassets of the Fund. Distributor: BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC, an affiliate of BFA, is the\ndistributor for each Fund. Pursuant to the\ndistribution agreement, BFA is responsible for\nany fees or expenses for distribution services\nprovided to the Funds. Securities Lending: The\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\u201cSEC\u201d) has issued an exemptive order which\npermits BlackRock Institutional Trust Company,\nN.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, to serve as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to applicable conditions. As\nsecurities lending agent, BTC bears all\noperational costs directly related to\nsecurities lending, including any custodial\ncosts. Each Fund is responsible for fees in\nconnection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan\n(the \u201ccollateral investment fees\u201d). The cash\ncollateral is invested in a money market fund,\nBlackRock Cash Funds: Institutional or\nBlackRock Cash Funds: Treasury, managed by\nBFA, or its affiliates. However, BTC has\nagreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees each Fund bears to an annual rate of\n0.04%. The SL Agency Shares of such money\nmarket fund will not be subject to a sales\nload, redemption fee, distribution fee or\nservice fee. The money market fund in which\nthe cash collateral has been invested may\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee of up to\n2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees. The share of\nsecurities lending income earned by each Fund\nis shown as securities lending income \u2013\naffiliated \u2013 net in its Statements of\nOperations. For the year ended August 31,\n2024, the Funds paid BTC the following amounts\nfor securities lending agent services:\n                                          \n  iShares ETF                    Amounts  \n  MSCI United Kingdom             $1,674  \n  MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap    2,874  \n                                          \nOfficers and Trustees: Certain officers and/or\ntrustees of the Company are officers and/or\ntrustees of BlackRock or its affiliates.\n\n19 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nOther Transactions: Cross trading is the\nbuying or selling of portfolio securities\nbetween funds to which BFA (or an affiliate)\nserves as investment adviser.

INCOME TAX INFORMATION Each Fund is treated\nas an entity separate from the Company\u2019s other\nfunds for federal income tax purposes. It is\neach Fund\u2019s policy to comply with the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies, and to distribute\nsubstantially all of its taxable income to its\nshareholders. Therefore, no U.S. federal\nincome tax provision is required. Management\nhas analyzed tax laws and regulations and\ntheir application to the Funds as of August\n31, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return\nyears, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require\nrecognition of a tax liability in the Funds\u2019\nfinancial statements. Management\u2019s analysis is\nbased on the tax laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date of these financial\nstatements, all of which are subject to\nchange, possibly with retroactive effect,\nwhich may impact the Funds\u2019 NAV.

LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the Funds did not\nborrow under the Syndicated Credit Agreement.\n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nValuation Risk: The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests.\n\n21 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nThe price each Fund could receive upon the\nsale of any particular portfolio investment\nmay differ from each Fund\u2019s valuation of the\ninvestment, particularly for securities that\ntrade in thin or volatile markets or that are\nvalued using a fair valuation technique or a\nprice provided by an independent pricing\nservice. Changes to significant unobservable\ninputs and assumptions (i.e., publicly traded\ncompany multiples, growth rate, time to exit)\ndue to the lack of observable inputs may\nsignificantly impact the resulting fair value\nand therefore each Fund\u2019s results of\noperations. As a result, the price received\nupon the sale of an investment may be less\nthan the value ascribed by each Fund, and each\nFund could realize a greater than expected\nloss or lesser than expected gain upon the\nsale of the investment. Each Fund\u2019s ability to\nvalue its investments may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Counterparty Credit Risk: The Funds\nmay be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or\nthe risk that an entity may fail to or be\nunable to perform on its commitments related\nto unsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy and at that time there\nis a shortfall in the aggregate amount of\nmargin held by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nissuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund's investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. The Funds invest\na significant portion of their assets in\nsecurities of issuers located in Europe or\nwith significant exposure to European issuers\nor countries. The European financial markets\nhave recently experienced volatility and\nadverse trends due to concerns about economic\ndownturns in, or rising government debt levels\nof, several European countries as well as acts\nof war in the region. These events may spread\nto other countries in Europe and may affect\nthe value and liquidity of certain of the\nFunds\u2019 investments. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not work, may result in\nsocial unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and others of\ntheir debt could have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. The United\nKingdom has withdrawn from the European Union,\nand one or more other countries may withdraw\nfrom the European Union and/or abandon the\nEuro, the common currency of the European\nUnion. These events and actions have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely\naffect , the value and exchange rate of the\nEuro and may continue to significantly affect\nthe economies of every country in Europe,\nincluding countries that do not use the Euro\nand non-European Union member states. The\nimpact of these actions, especially if they\noccur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear\nbut could be significant and far reaching. In\naddition, Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions in the region are\nimpossible to predict, but have been, and may\ncontinue to be, significant and have a severe\nadverse effect on the region, including\nsignificant negative impacts on the economy\nand the markets for certain securities and\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors. Significant Shareholder\nRedemption Risk: Certain shareholders may own\nor manage a substantial amount of fund shares\nand/or hold their fund investments for a\nlimited period of time. Large redemptions of\nfund shares by these shareholders may force a\nfund to sell portfolio securities, which may\nnegatively impact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nfund\u2019s brokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11. CAPITAL\nSHARE TRANSACTIONS Capital shares are issued\nand redeemed by each Fund only in aggregations\nof a specified number of shares or multiples\nthereof (\u201cCreation Units\u201d) at NAV.

Certain funds in the\nCompany may be offered in Creation Units\nsolely or partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase\ntransaction fee and a redemption transaction\nfee directly to BRIL, to offset transfer and\nother transaction costs associated with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units,\nincluding Creation Units for cash. Authorized\nParticipants transacting in Creation Units for\ncash may also pay an additional variable\ncharge to compensate the relevant fund for\ncertain transaction costs (i.e., stamp taxes,\ntaxes on currency or other financial\ntransactions, and brokerage costs) and market\nimpact expenses relating to investing in\nportfolio securities. Such variable charges,\nif any, are included in shares sold in the\ntable above. To the extent applicable, to\nfacilitate the timely settlement of orders for\nFunds using a clearing facility outside of the\ncontinuous net settlement process, the Funds,\nat their sole discretion, may permit an\nAuthorized Participant to post cash as\ncollateral in anticipation of the delivery of\nall or a portion of the applicable Deposit\nSecurities or Fund Securities, as further\ndescribed in the applicable Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. The collateral process\nis subject to a Control Agreement among the\nAuthorized Participant, each Funds\u2019 custodian,\nand the Funds. In the event that the\nAuthorized Participant fails to deliver all or\na portion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, the Funds may exercise\ncontrol over such collateral pursuant to the\nterms of the Control Agreement in order to\npurchase the applicable Deposit Securities or\nFund Securities. From time to time, settlement\nof securities related to in-kind contributions\nor in-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement\u2019s evaluation of the impact of all\nsubsequent events on the Funds\u2019 financial\nstatements was completed through the date the\nfinancial statements were available to be\nissued and the following item was noted:\nEffective October 16, 2024, the Syndicated\nCredit Agreement to which the Participating\nFunds are party was amended to extend the\nmaturity date to October 15, 2025 under the\nsame terms.\n\n23 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Trustees of\niShares Trust and Shareholders of each of the\ntwo funds listed in the table below Opinions\non the Financial Statements We have audited\nthe accompanying statements of assets and\nliabilities, including the schedules of\ninvestments, of each of the funds listed in\nthe table below (two of the funds constituting\niShares Trust, hereafter collectively referred\nto as the \"Funds\") as of August 31, 2024, the\nrelated statements of operations for the year\nended August 31, 2024, the statements of\nchanges in net assets for each of the two\nyears in the period ended August 31, 2024,\nincluding the related notes, and the financial\nhighlights for each of the five years in the\nperiod ended August 31, 2024 (collectively\nreferred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Funds in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements.

Regulation under\nthe Alternative Investment Fund Managers\nDirective The Alternative Investment Fund\nManagers Directive, and its United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d) equivalent, (the \u201cAIFMD\u201d) impose\ndetailed and prescriptive obligations on fund\nmanagers established in the European Union\n(the \u201cEU\u201d) and the UK. These do not currently\napply to managers established outside of the\nEU or UK, such as BFA (the \u201cCompany\u201d).\nHowever, the Company is required to comply\nwith certain disclosure, reporting and\ntransparency obligations of the AIFMD because\nit has registered the iShares MSCI United\nKingdom ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) to be marketed to\ninvestors in the EU and/or UK. Report on\nRemuneration BlackRock has a clear and well-\ndefined pay-for-performance philosophy, and\ncompensation programs which support that\nphilosophy. BlackRock operates a total\ncompensation model for remuneration which\nincludes a base salary, which is contractual,\nand a discretionary bonus scheme. Although all\nemployees are eligible to receive a\ndiscretionary bonus, there is no contractual\nobligation to make a discretionary bonus award\nto any employees. For senior management and\nstaff who have the ability to materially\naffect the risk profile of the Fund, a\nsignificant percentage of variable\nremuneration is deferred over time. All\nemployees are subject to a clawback policy.\nRemuneration decisions for employees are made\nonce annually in January following the end of\nthe performance year, based on BlackRock\u2019s\nfull-year financial results and other non-\nfinancial goals and objectives. Alongside\nfinancial performance, individual total\ncompensation is also based on strategic and\noperating results and other considerations\nsuch as management and leadership\ncapabilities. No set formulas are established\nand no fixed benchmarks are used in\ndetermining annual incentive awards. Annual\nincentive awards are paid from a bonus pool\nwhich is reviewed throughout the year by\nBlackRock's independent compensation\ncommittee, taking into account both actual and\nprojected financial information together with\ninformation provided by the Enterprise Risk\nand Regulatory Compliance departments in\nrelation to any activities, incidents or\nevents that warrant consideration in making\ncompensation decisions. Individuals are not\ninvolved in setting their own remuneration.\nEach of the control functions (Enterprise\nRisk, Legal & Compliance, Finance, Human\nResources and Internal Audit) each have their\nown organizational structures which are\nindependent of the business units and\ntherefore staff members in control functions\nare remunerated independently of the\nbusinesses they oversee. Functional bonus\npools for those control functions are\ndetermined with reference to the performance\nof each individual function and the\nremuneration of the senior members of control\nfunctions is directly overseen by BlackRock's\nindependent remuneration committee. The\nCompany is required under the AIFMD to make\nquantitative disclosures of remuneration.\nThese disclosures are made in line with\nBlackRock\u2019s interpretation of currently\navailable regulatory guidance on quantitative\nremuneration disclosures. As market or\nregulatory practice develops BlackRock may\nconsider it appropriate to make changes to the\nway in which quantitative remuneration\ndisclosures are calculated. Where such changes\nare made, this may result in disclosures in\nrelation to a fund not being comparable to the\ndisclosures made in the prior year, or in\nrelation to other BlackRock fund disclosures\nin that same year. BlackRock bases its\nproportionality approach on a combination of\nfactors that it is entitled to take into\naccount based on relevant guidelines.\nRemuneration information at an individual Fund\nlevel is not readily available. Disclosures\nare provided in relation to (a) the staff of\nthe Company; (b) staff who are senior\nmanagement; (c) staff who have the ability to\nmaterially affect the risk profile of the\nFund; and (d) staff of companies to which\nportfolio management and risk management has\nbeen formally delegated. All individuals\nincluded in the aggregated figures disclosed\nare rewarded in line with BlackRock\u2019s\nremuneration policy for their responsibilities\nacross the relevant BlackRock business area.\nAs all individuals have a number of areas of\nresponsibilities, only the portion of\nremuneration for those individuals\u2019 services\nattributable to the Fund is included in the\naggregate figures disclosed. Members of staff\nand senior management of the Company typically\nprovide both AIFMD and non-AIFMD related\nservices in respect of multiple funds, clients\nand functions of the Company and across the\nbroader BlackRock group. Conversely, members\nof staff and senior management of the broader\nBlackRock group may provide both AIFMD and\nnon-AIFMD related services in respect of\nmultiple funds, clients and functions of the\nbroader BlackRock group and of the Company.\nTherefore, the figures disclosed are a sum of\nindividuals\u2019 portion of remuneration\nattributable to the Company according to an\nobjective apportionment methodology which\nacknowledges the multiple-service nature of\nthe Company and the broader BlackRock group.\nAccordingly, the figures are not\nrepresentative of any individual\u2019s actual\nremuneration or their remuneration structure.\nThe amount of the total remuneration awarded\nto the Company\u2019s staff in respect of the\nCompany\u2019s financial year ending December 31,\n2023 was USD 5.43m. This figure is comprised\nof fixed remuneration of USD 0.74m and\nvariable remuneration of USD 4.68m. There was\na total of 8 beneficiaries of the remuneration\ndescribed above. The amount of the aggregate\nremuneration awarded by the Company in respect\nof the Company\u2019s financial year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, to its senior management\nwas USD 3.66m, and to other members of its\nstaff whose actions potentially have a\nmaterial impact on the risk profile of the\nCompany or its funds was USD 1.77m.\n\nAdditional Information 26\n\nAdditional Information (continued)\n\nDisclosures Under the EU Sustainable Finance\nDisclosure Regulation The iShares MSCI United\nKingdom ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) is registered under\nthe Alternative Investment Fund Managers\nDirective to be marketed to European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d) investors, as noted above. As a result,\ncertain disclosures are required under the EU\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n(\u201cSFDR\u201d). The Fund has not been categorized\nunder the SFDR as an \u201cArticle 8\u201d or \u201cArticle\n9\u201d product. In addition, the Fund\u2019s investment\nstrategy does not take into account the\ncriteria for environmentally sustainable\neconomic activities under the EU sustainable\ninvestment taxonomy regulation or principal\nadverse impacts (\u201cPAIs\u201d) on sustainability\nfactors under the SFDR. PAIs are identified\nunder the SFDR as the material impacts of\ninvestment decisions on sustainability factors\nrelating to environmental, social and employee\nmatters, respect for human rights, and anti-\ncorruption and anti-bribery matters.\nElectronic Delivery Shareholders can sign up\nfor e-mail notifications announcing that the\nshareholder report or prospectus has been\nposted on the iShares website at iShares.com .\nOnce you have enrolled, you will no longer\nreceive prospectuses and shareholder reports\nin the mail.

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were higher than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 28\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates\nmanage Other Accounts with substantially the\nsame investment objective and strategy as the\nFund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by\n\n29 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, and paid for by authorized\nparticipants under the ETF Servicing Platform.\nThe Board also noted the revenue received by\nBFA and/or its affiliates pursuant to an\nagreement that permits a service provider to\nuse certain portions of BlackRock\u2019s technology\nplatform to service accounts managed by BFA\nand/or its affiliates, including the iShares\nfunds. The Board noted that BFA generally does\nnot use soft dollars or consider the value of\nresearch or other services that may be\nprovided to BFA (including its affiliates) in\nselecting brokers for portfolio transactions\nfor the Fund. The Board concluded that any\nsuch ancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF (the\n\u201cFund\u201d) Under Section 15(c) of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d),\nincluding a majority of Board Members who are\nnot \u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust (as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) (the\n\u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is required\nannually to consider the approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).The Board was provided with\na detailed description of the proprietary ETF\nmethodology used by Broadridge to determine\nthe Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board noted that,\ndue to the limitations in providing comparable\nfunds in the Peer Group, the statistical\ninformation provided in Broadridge\u2019s report\nmay or may not provide meaningful direct\ncomparisons to the Fund in all instances. The\nBoard also noted that the investment advisory\nfee rate and overall expenses (net of any\nwaivers and reimbursements) for the Fund were\nhigher than the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds. In addition, to the extent that any of\nthe comparison funds included in the Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds, track the same\nindex as the Fund, Broadridge also provided,\nand the Board reviewed, a comparison of the\nFund\u2019s performance for the one-year, three-\nyear, five-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 30\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nthe scope of these services, the Board\nconsidered BFA\u2019s investment philosophy and\nexperience, noting that BFA and its affiliates\nhave committed significant resources over\ntime, including during the past year, to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business. The\nBoard also considered BFA\u2019s compliance program\nand its compliance record with respect to the\nFund, including related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund, as well as the\nresources available to them in managing the\nFund. In addition to the above considerations,\nthe Board reviewed and considered detailed\npresentations regarding BFA\u2019s investment\nperformance, investment and risk management\nprocesses and strategies provided at the May\n6, 2024 meeting and throughout the year, and\nmatters related to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance\nprogram and other compliance programs and\nservices, as well as BlackRock\u2019s continued\ninvestments in its ETF business. Based on\nreview of this information, and the\nperformance information discussed above, the\nBoard concluded that the nature, extent and\nquality of services provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the continuance of the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year. Costs of\nServices Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund did not provide for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund increase. However, the\nBoard noted that it would continue to assess\nthe appropriateness of adding breakpoints in\nthe future. The Board concluded that this\nreview of potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed.\n\n31 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nOther Benefits to BFA and/or its Affiliates:\nThe Board reviewed other benefits or ancillary\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\nin connection with the services provided to\nthe Fund by BFA, both direct and indirect,\nincluding, but not limited to, payment of\nrevenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nagent, for loaning portfolio securities, as\napplicable (which was included in the profit\nmargins reviewed by the Board pursuant to\nBFA\u2019s estimated profitability methodology),\npayment of advisory fees or other fees to BFA\n(or its affiliates) in connection with any\ninvestments by the Fund in other funds\n(including cash sweep vehicles) for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory services or other services, and\nBlackRock\u2019s profile in the investment\ncommunity. The Board further considered other\ndirect benefits that might accrue to BFA,\nincluding actual and potential reductions in\nthe Fund\u2019s expenses that are borne by BFA\nunder the \u201call-inclusive\u201d management fee\narrangement, due in part to the size and scope\nof BFA\u2019s investment operations servicing the\nFund (and other funds in the iShares complex)\nas well as in response to a changing market\nenvironment. The Board also reviewed and\nconsidered information provided by BFA\nconcerning authorized participant primary\nmarket order processing services that are\nprovided by BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, and paid for by\nauthorized participants under the ETF\nServicing Platform. The Board also noted the\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\npursuant to an agreement that permits a\nservice provider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 32\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                      \n        Portfolio Abbreviation        \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares             \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust  \n                                      \n33 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\n34\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.

ORGANIZATION iShares Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as an open-\nend management investment company. The Trust\nis organized as a Delaware statutory trust and\nis authorized to have multiple series or\nportfolios. These financial statements relate\nonly to the following funds (each, a \u201cFund\u201d\nand collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                              \n  iShares ETF           DiversificationClas\u2026  \n  MSCI Brazil           Diversified           \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  MSCI China            Non-diversified       \n  MSCI China Small-Cap  Diversified           \n  MSCI Indonesia        Non-diversified       \n  MSCI Peru and Global  Non-diversified       \n  Exposure                                    \n  MSCI Philippines      Non-diversified       \n  MSCI Poland           Non-diversified       \n  MSCI Qatar            Non-diversified       \n  MSCI Saudi Arabia     Non-diversified       \n  MSCI UAE              Non-diversified       \n                                              \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The\nfinancial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEach Fund is considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies: Investment Transactions\nand Income Recognition: For financial\nreporting purposes, investment transactions\nare recorded on the dates the transactions are\nexecuted. Realized gains and losses on\ninvestment transactions are determined using\nthe specific identification method. Dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions, if any,\nare recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value. Dividends from\nforeign securities where the ex-dividend date\nmay have passed are subsequently recorded when\nthe Funds are informed of the ex-dividend\ndate. Under the applicable foreign tax laws, a\nwithholding tax at various rates may be\nimposed on capital gains, dividends and\ninterest. Upon notification from issuers or as\nestimated by management, a portion of the\ndividend income received from a real estate\ninvestment trust may be redesignated as a\nreduction of cost of the related investment\nand/or realized gain. Interest income,\nincluding amortization and accretion of\npremiums and discounts on debt securities, is\nrecognized daily on an accrual basis. Foreign\nCurrency Translation: Each Fund's books and\nrecords are maintained in U.S. dollars.\nSecurities and other assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using prevailing\nmarket rates as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments are recorded at the rates of\nexchange prevailing on the respective dates of\nsuch transactions. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, the investments denominated in that\ncurrency will lose value; the opposite effect\noccurs if the U.S. dollar falls in relative\nvalue. Each Fund does not isolate the effect\nof fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from\nthe effect of fluctuations in the market\nprices of investments for financial reporting\npurposes. Accordingly, the effects of changes\nin exchange rates on investments are not\nsegregated in the Statements of Operations\nfrom the effects of changes in market prices\nof those investments, but are included as a\ncomponent of net realized and unrealized gain\n(loss) from investments. Each Fund reports\nrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency related transactions as components of\nnet realized gain (loss) for financial\nreporting purposes, whereas such components\nare generally treated as ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign\nTaxes: The Funds may be subject to foreign\ntaxes (a portion of which may be reclaimable)\non income, stock dividends, capital gains on\ninvestments, or certain foreign currency\ntransactions. All foreign taxes are recorded\nin accordance with the applicable foreign tax\nregulations and rates that exist in the\nforeign jurisdictions in which each Fund\ninvests. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid\nby each Fund and are reflected in its\nStatements of Operations as follows: foreign\ntaxes withheld at source are presented as a\nreduction of income, foreign taxes on\nsecurities lending income are presented as a\nreduction of securities lending income,\nforeign taxes on stock dividends are presented\nas \u201cOther foreign taxes\u201d, and foreign taxes on\ncapital gains from sales of investments and\nforeign taxes on foreign currency transactions\nare included in their respective net realized\ngain (loss) categories. Foreign taxes payable\nor deferred as of August 31, 2024, if any, are\ndisclosed in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Consistent with U.S. GAAP accrual\nrequirements, for uncertain tax positions,\neach Fund recognizes tax reclaims when the\nFund determines that it is more likely than\nnot that the Fund will sustain its position\nthat it is due the reclaim. The Funds file\nwithholding tax reclaims in certain\njurisdictions to recover a portion of amounts\npreviously withheld. The Funds may record a\nreclaim receivable based on collectability,\nwhich includes factors such as the\njurisdiction\u2019s applicable laws, payment\nhistory and market convention. The Statements\nof Operations include tax reclaims recorded as\nwell as professional and other fees, if any,\nassociated with recovery of foreign\nwithholding taxes.\n\n63 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nBank Overdraft: Certain Funds had outstanding\ncash disbursements exceeding deposited cash\namounts at the custodian during the reporting\nperiod. The Funds are obligated to repay the\ncustodian for any overdraft, including any\nrelated costs or expenses, where applicable.\nFor financial reporting purposes, overdraft\nfees, if any, are included in interest expense\nin the Statements of Operations.\nCollateralization: If required by an exchange\nor counterparty agreement, the Funds may be\nrequired to deliver/deposit cash and/or\nsecurities to/with an exchange, or broker-\ndealer or custodian as collateral for certain\ninvestments. In-kind Redemptions: For\nfinancial reporting purposes, in-kind\nredemptions are treated as sales of securities\nresulting in realized capital gains or losses\nto the Funds. Because such gains or losses are\nnot taxable to the Funds and are not\ndistributed to existing Fund shareholders, the\ngains or losses are reclassified from\naccumulated net realized gain (loss) to paid-\nin capital at the end of the Funds\u2019 tax year.\nThese reclassifications have no effect on net\nassets or net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share.\nDistributions: Dividends and distributions\npaid by each Fund are recorded on the ex-\ndividend dates. Distributions are determined\non a tax basis and may differ from net\ninvestment income and net realized capital\ngains for financial reporting purposes.\nDividends and distributions are paid in U.S.\ndollars and cannot be automatically reinvested\nin additional shares of the Funds.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund enters into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Funds\u2019\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Funds, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty. 3. INVESTMENT\nVALUATION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies: Each Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of each Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Funds\u2019 investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund. Each Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees. Fair Value\nInputs and Methodologies: The following\nmethods and inputs are used to establish the\nfair value of each Fund\u2019s assets and\nliabilities: \u2022 Equity investments traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange are valued at\nthat day\u2019s official closing price, as\napplicable, on the exchange where the stock is\nprimarily traded. Equity investments traded on\na recognized exchange for which there were no\nsales on that day are valued at the last\ntraded price. \u2022 Investments in open-end U.S.\nmutual funds (including money market funds)\nare valued at that day\u2019s published NAV. \u2022\nFutures contracts are valued based on that\nday\u2019s last reported settlement or trade price\non the exchange where the contract is traded.\nGenerally, trading in foreign instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Each business\nday, the Funds use current market factors\nsupplied by independent pricing services to\nvalue certain foreign instruments (\u201cSystematic\nFair Value Price\u201d). The Systematic Fair Value\nPrice is designed to value such foreign\nsecurities at fair value as of the close of\ntrading on the NYSE, which follows the close\nof the local markets. If events (e.g., market\nvolatility, company announcement or a natural\ndisaster) occur that are expected to\nmaterially affect the value of such\ninvestment, or in the event that application\nof these methods of valuation results in a\nprice for an investment that is deemed not to\nbe representative of the market value of such\ninvestment, or if a price is not available,\nthe investment will be valued by the Valuation\nCommittee, in accordance with BFA\u2019s policies\nand procedures as reflecting fair value (\u201cFair\nValued Investments\u201d). The fair valuation\napproaches that may be used by the Valuation\nCommittee include market approach, income\napproach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use\nof market comparables and matrix pricing are\ntypes of valuation approaches and are\ntypically used in determining fair value. When\ndetermining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that each Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue pricing could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, which in turn could result\nin a difference between the fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the fund\u2019s underlying\nindex. Fair Value Hierarchy: Various inputs\nare used in determining the fair value of\nfinancial instruments. These inputs to\nvaluation techniques are categorized into a\nfair value hierarchy consisting of three broad\nlevels for financial reporting purposes as\nfollows: \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 Unadjusted price\nquotations in active markets/exchanges for\nidentical assets or liabilities that each Fund\nhas the ability to access; \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 Other\nobservable inputs (including, but not limited\nto, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are active, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active,\ninputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the assets or liabilities (such\nas interest rates, yield curves, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit\nrisks and default rates) or other market-\ncorroborated inputs); and\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 64\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2013 Unobservable inputs based on the\nbest information available in the\ncircumstances, to the extent observable inputs\nare not available, (including the Valuation\nCommittee\u2019s assumptions used in determining\nthe fair value of financial instruments). The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities. 4. SECURITIES\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS Securities Lending: Each\nFund may lend its securities to approved\nborrowers, such as brokers, dealers and other\nfinancial institutions. The borrower pledges\nand maintains with the Fund collateral\nconsisting of cash, an irrevocable letter of\ncredit issued by an approved bank, or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. The initial collateral received by\neach Fund is required to have a value of at\nleast 102% of the current market value of the\nloaned securities for securities traded on\nU.S. exchanges and a value of at least 105%\nfor all other securities. The collateral is\nmaintained thereafter at a value equal to at\nleast 100% of the current value of the\nsecurities on loan. The market value of the\nloaned securities is determined at the close\nof each business day of the Fund and any\nadditional required collateral is delivered to\nthe Fund or excess collateral is returned by\nthe Fund, on the next business day. During the\nterm of the loan, each Fund is entitled to all\ndistributions made on or in respect of the\nloaned securities but does not receive\ninterest income on securities received as\ncollateral. Loans of securities are terminable\nat any time and the borrower, after notice, is\nrequired to return borrowed securities within\nthe standard time period for settlement of\nsecurities transactions. As of period end, any\nsecurities on loan were collateralized by cash\nand/or U.S. Government obligations. Cash\ncollateral invested in money market funds\nmanaged by BFA, or its affiliates is disclosed\nin the Schedule of Investments. Any non-cash\ncollateral received cannot be sold, re-\ninvested or pledged by the Fund, except in the\nevent of borrower default. The securities on\nloan, if any, are also disclosed in each\nFund\u2019s Schedule of Investments. The market\nvalue of any securities on loan and the value\nof any related cash collateral are disclosed\nin the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities lending transactions are entered\ninto by the Funds under Master Securities\nLending Agreements (each, an \u201cMSLA\u201d) which\nprovide the right, in the event of default\n(including bankruptcy or insolvency) for the\nnon-defaulting party to liquidate the\ncollateral and calculate a net exposure to the\ndefaulting party or request additional\ncollateral. In the event that a borrower\ndefaults, the Funds, as lender, would offset\nthe market value of the collateral received\nagainst the market value of the securities\nloaned. When the value of the collateral is\ngreater than that of the market value of the\nsecurities loaned, the lender is left with a\nnet amount payable to the defaulting party.\nHowever, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction may impose\nrestrictions on or prohibitions against such a\nright of offset in the event of an MSLA\ncounterparty\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. Under\nthe MSLA, absent an event of default, the\nborrower can resell or re-pledge the loaned\nsecurities, and the Funds can reinvest cash\ncollateral received in connection with loaned\nsecurities. Upon an event of default, the\nparties\u2019 obligations to return the securities\nor collateral to the other party are\nextinguished, and the parties can resell or\nre-pledge the loaned securities or the\ncollateral received in connection with the\nloaned securities in order to satisfy the\ndefaulting party\u2019s net payment obligation for\nall transactions under the MSLA. The\ndefaulting party remains liable for any\ndeficiency. As of period end, the following\ntable is a summary of the securities on loan\nby counterparty which are subject to offset\nunder an MSLA:\n                                              \n

To mitigate\nthese risks, each Fund benefits from a\nborrower default indemnity provided by\nBlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). BlackRock\u2019s\nindemnity allows for full replacement of the\nsecurities loaned to the extent the collateral\nreceived does not cover the value of the\nsecurities loaned in the event of borrower\ndefault. Each Fund could incur a loss if the\nvalue of an investment purchased with cash\ncollateral falls below the market value of the\nloaned securities or if the value of an\ninvestment purchased with cash collateral\nfalls below the value of the original cash\ncollateral received. Such losses are borne\nentirely by each Fund. 5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL\nINSTRUMENTS Futures Contracts: Futures\ncontracts are purchased or sold to gain\nexposure to, or manage exposure to, changes in\ninterest rates (interest rate risk) and\nchanges in the value of equity securities\n(equity risk) or foreign currencies (foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk). Futures\ncontracts are exchange-traded agreements\nbetween the Funds and a counterparty to buy or\nsell a specific quantity of an underlying\ninstrument at a specified price and on a\nspecified date. Depending on the terms of a\ncontract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Funds are\nrequired to deposit initial margin with the\nbroker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on a contract\u2019s\nsize and risk profile. The initial margin\ndeposit must then be maintained at an\nestablished level over the life of the\ncontract. Amounts pledged, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities.\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investments and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant\nto the contract, the Funds agree to receive\nfrom or pay to the broker an amount of cash\nequal to the daily fluctuation in market value\nof the contract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d).\nVariation margin is recorded as unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) and, if any, shown\nas variation margin receivable (or payable) on\nfutures contracts in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities. When the contract is closed,\na realized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatements of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets. 6.

Distributor: BlackRock Investments, LLC,\nan affiliate of BFA, is the distributor for\neach Fund. Pursuant to the distribution\nagreement, BFA is responsible for any fees or\nexpenses for distribution services provided to\nthe Funds. Securities Lending: The U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d)\nhas issued an exemptive order which permits\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.\n(\u201cBTC\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, to serve as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to applicable conditions. As\nsecurities lending agent, BTC bears all\noperational costs directly related to\nsecurities lending, including any custodial\ncosts. Each Fund is responsible for fees in\nconnection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan\n(the \u201ccollateral investment fees\u201d). The cash\ncollateral is invested in a money market fund,\nBlackRock Cash Funds: Institutional or\nBlackRock Cash Funds: Treasury, managed by\nBFA, or its affiliates. However, BTC has\nagreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees each Fund bears to an annual rate of\n0.04%. The SL Agency Shares of such money\nmarket fund will not be subject to a sales\nload, redemption fee, distribution fee or\nservice fee. The money market fund in which\nthe cash collateral has been invested may\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee of up to\n2% of the value redeemed, if such fee is\ndetermined to be in the best interests of such\nmoney market fund. Securities lending income\nis generally equal to the total of income\nearned from the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. Each Fund\nretains a portion of the securities lending\nincome and remits the remaining portion to BTC\nas compensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Pursuant to the current\nsecurities lending agreement, each Fund\nretains 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand the amount retained can never be less than\n70% of the total of securities lending income\nplus the collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income plus the collateral\ninvestment fees generated across all 1940 Act\niShares exchange-traded funds (the \u201ciShares\nETF Complex\u201d) in that calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each Fund, pursuant to\nthe securities lending agreement, will retain\nfor the remainder of that calendar year 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and the amount\nretained can never be less than 70% of the\ntotal of securities lending income plus the\ncollateral investment fees.

LINE OF CREDIT The Funds, along with\ncertain other iShares funds (\u201cParticipating\nFunds\u201d), are parties to a $800 million credit\nagreement (\u201cSyndicated Credit Agreement\u201d) with\na group of lenders, which expires on October\n16, 2024. The line of credit may be used for\ntemporary or emergency purposes, including\nredemptions, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings in certain\ntarget markets. The Funds may borrow up to the\naggregate commitment amount subject to asset\ncoverage and other limitations as specified in\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. The\nSyndicated Credit Agreement has the following\nterms: a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on\nthe unused portion of the credit agreement and\ninterest at a rate equal to the higher of (a)\nDaily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.10% and 1.00% per annum or (b)\nthe U.S. Federal Funds rate plus 1.00% per\nannum on amounts borrowed. The commitment fee\nis generally allocated to each Participating\nFund based on the lesser of a Participating\nFund\u2019s relative exposure to certain target\nmarkets or a Participating Fund\u2019s maximum\nborrowing amount as set forth by the terms of\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement. During the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the iShares MSCI\nBrazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF,\niShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI\nIndonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global\nExposure ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF,\niShares MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar\nETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF did not borrow\nunder the Syndicated Credit Agreement. For the\nyear ended August 31, 2024, the maximum amount\nborrowed, the average daily borrowing and the\nweighted average interest rate, if any, under\nthe Syndicated Credit Agreement were as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  iShares   MaximumA\u2026  AverageBo\u2026  Weighted\u2026  \n  ETF                              Rates      \n  MSCI                                        \n  Saudi     $51,810,\u2026    $566,230  6.41%      \n  Arabia                                      \n                                              \n10. PRINCIPAL RISKS In the normal course of\nbusiness, each Fund invests in securities or\nother instruments and may enter into certain\ntransactions, and such activities subject the\nFund to various risks, including, among\nothers, fluctuations in the market (market\nrisk) or failure of an issuer to meet all of\nits obligations. The value of securities or\nother instruments may also be affected by\nvarious factors, including, without\nlimitation: (i) the general economy; (ii) the\noverall market as well as local, regional or\nglobal political and/or social instability;\n(iii) regulation, taxation or international\ntax treaties between various countries; or\n(iv) currency, interest rate or price\nfluctuations. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, recessions, or other events could have\na significant impact on the Funds and their\ninvestments. Each Fund\u2019s prospectus provides\ndetails of the risks to which the Fund is\nsubject. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve each Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nThe Fund is not actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market conditions,\nincluding declining markets. The Funds may be\nexposed to additional risks when reinvesting\ncash collateral in money market funds that do\nnot seek to maintain a stable NAV per share of\n$1.00, which may be subject to discretionary\nliquidity fees under certain circumstances.\nValuation Risk: The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 70\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nilliquid investments in a timely manner at the\nprice that it believes the investments are\nworth. Prices may fluctuate widely over short\nor extended periods in response to company,\nmarket or economic news. Markets also tend to\nmove in cycles, with periods of rising and\nfalling prices. This volatility may cause a\nfund\u2019s NAV to experience significant increases\nor decreases over short periods of time. If\nthere is a general decline in the securities\nand other markets, the NAV of a fund may lose\nvalue, regardless of the individual results of\nthe securities and other instruments in which\na fund invests. The price each Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from each\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for securities that trade in thin\nor volatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation technique or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. Changes to\nsignificant unobservable inputs and\nassumptions (i.e., publicly traded company\nmultiples, growth rate, time to exit) due to\nthe lack of observable inputs may\nsignificantly impact the resulting fair value\nand therefore each Fund\u2019s results of\noperations. As a result, the price received\nupon the sale of an investment may be less\nthan the value ascribed by each Fund, and each\nFund could realize a greater than expected\nloss or lesser than expected gain upon the\nsale of the investment. Each Fund\u2019s ability to\nvalue its investments may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Counterparty Credit Risk: The Funds\nmay be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or\nthe risk that an entity may fail to or be\nunable to perform on its commitments related\nto unsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Funds manage counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Funds to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Funds\u2019 exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Funds. A derivative\ncontract may suffer a mark-to-market loss if\nthe value of the contract decreases due to an\nunfavorable change in the market rates or\nvalues of the underlying instrument. Losses\ncan also occur if the counterparty does not\nperform under the contract. With exchange-\ntraded futures, there is less counterparty\ncredit risk to the Funds since the exchange or\nclearinghouse, as counterparty to such\ninstruments, guarantees against a possible\ndefault. The clearinghouse stands between the\nbuyer and the seller of the contract;\ntherefore, credit risk is limited to failure\nof the clearinghouse. While offset rights may\nexist under applicable law, a Fund does not\nhave a contractual right of offset against a\nclearing broker or clearinghouse in the event\nof a default (including the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency). Additionally, credit risk exists\nin exchange-traded futures with respect to\ninitial and variation margin that is held in a\nclearing broker\u2019s customer accounts. While\nclearing brokers are required to segregate\ncustomer margin from their own assets, in the\nevent that a clearing broker becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy and at that time there\nis a shortfall in the aggregate amount of\nmargin held by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Funds.\nGeographic/Asset Class Risk: A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin each Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments. Certain Funds\ninvest a significant portion of their assets\nin issuers located in a single country or a\nlimited number of countries. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions in that\ncountry or those countries may have a\nsignificant impact on the fund and could\naffect the income from, or the value or\nliquidity of, the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may cause uncertainty in the\nmarkets and as a result adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s investments. Foreign issuers may not be\nsubject to the same uniform accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices as used in the United States.\nForeign securities markets may also be more\nvolatile and less liquid than U.S. securities\nand may be less subject to governmental\nsupervision not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities. Investment\npercentages in specific countries are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\nCertain Funds invest a significant portion of\ntheir assets in securities of issuers located\nin China or with significant exposure to\nChinese issuers. Investments in Chinese\nsecurities, including certain Hong Kong-listed\nsecurities, involve risks specific to China.\nChina may be subject to considerable degrees\nof economic, political and social instability\nand demonstrates significantly higher\nvolatility from time to time in comparison to\ndeveloped markets. Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies resulting\nfrom governmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Internal\nsocial unrest or confrontations with other\nneighboring countries may disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. Incidents involving\nChina\u2019s or the region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in Chinese markets and may\nadversely affect the Chinese economy and a\nfund\u2019s investments. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of tariffs,\nsanctions or other trade barriers, or a\ndownturn in any of the economies of China\u2019s\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy. In addition,\nmeasures may be taken to limit the flow of\ncapital and/or sanctions may be imposed, which\ncould prohibit or restrict the ability to own\nor transfer fund assets and may also include\nretaliatory actions, such as seizure of fund\nassets. Certain Funds invest a significant\nportion of their assets in securities of\nissuers located in Asia or with significant\nexposure to Asian issuers or countries. The\nAsian financial markets have recently\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns in several Asian countries\nregarding monetary policy, government\nintervention in the markets, rising government\ndebt levels or economic downturns. These\nevents may spread to other countries in Asia\nand may affect the value and liquidity of\ncertain of the Funds\u2019 investments. Certain\nFunds invest a significant portion of their\nassets in securities within a single or\nlimited number of market sectors. When a fund\nconcentrates its investments in this manner,\nit assumes the risk that economic, regulatory,\npolitical and social conditions affecting such\nsectors may have a significant impact on the\nfund and could affect the income from, or the\nvalue or liquidity of, the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nInvestment percentages in specific sectors are\npresented in the Schedule of Investments.\n\n71 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nSignificant Shareholder Redemption Risk:\nCertain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders. 11.

Certain funds in the\nTrust may be offered in Creation Units solely\nor partially for cash in U.S. dollars.\nAuthorized Participants purchasing and\nredeeming\n\nNotes to Financial Statements 72\n\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\n\nCreation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly\nto State Street Bank and Trust Company, the\nTrust\u2019s administrator, to offset transfer and\nother transaction costs associated with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units,\nincluding Creation Units for cash. Authorized\nParticipants transacting in Creation Units for\ncash may also pay an additional variable\ncharge to compensate the relevant fund for\ncertain transaction costs (i.e., stamp taxes,\ntaxes on currency or other financial\ntransactions, and brokerage costs) and market\nimpact expenses relating to investing in\nportfolio securities. Such variable charges,\nif any, are included in shares sold in the\ntable above. To the extent applicable, to\nfacilitate the timely settlement of orders for\nFunds using a clearing facility outside of the\ncontinuous net settlement process, the Funds,\nat their sole discretion, may permit an\nAuthorized Participant to post cash as\ncollateral in anticipation of the delivery of\nall or a portion of the applicable Deposit\nSecurities or Fund Securities, as further\ndescribed in the applicable Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. The collateral process\nis subject to a Control Agreement among the\nAuthorized Participant, each Funds\u2019 custodian,\nand the Funds. In the event that the\nAuthorized Participant fails to deliver all or\na portion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nor Fund Securities, the Funds may exercise\ncontrol over such collateral pursuant to the\nterms of the Control Agreement in order to\npurchase the applicable Deposit Securities or\nFund Securities. From time to time, settlement\nof securities related to in-kind contributions\nor in-kind redemptions may be delayed. In such\ncases, securities related to in-kind\ntransactions are reflected as a receivable or\na payable in the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. 12. FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX\nCLAIMS Certain of the outstanding foreign tax\nreclaims are not deemed by the Fund to meet\nthe recognition criteria under U.S. GAAP as of\nAugust 31, 2024 and have not been recorded in\nthe applicable Fund\u2019s net asset value. The\nrecognition by the Fund of these amounts would\nhave a positive impact on the applicable\nFund's performance. If a Fund receives a tax\nrefund that has not been previously recorded,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time the claim is\nsuccessful will benefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors who sold\ntheir shares prior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase. The iShares\nMSCI Poland ETF is seeking a closing agreement\nwith the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to\naddress any prior years\u2019 U.S. income tax\nliabilities attributable to Fund shareholders\nresulting from the recovery of foreign taxes.\nThe closing agreement would result in the Fund\npaying a compliance fee to the IRS, on behalf\nof its shareholders, representing the\nestimated tax savings generated from foreign\ntax credits claimed by Fund shareholders on\ntheir tax returns in prior years. The Fund has\naccrued a liability for the estimated IRS\ncompliance fee related to foreign withholding\ntax claims, which is disclosed in the\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities. The\nactual IRS compliance fee may differ from the\nestimate and that difference may be material.\n13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management\u2019s evaluation\nof the impact of all subsequent events on the\nFunds\u2019 financial statements was completed\nthrough the date the financial statements were\navailable to be issued and the following items\nwere noted: On October 8, 2024, the iShares\nMSCI Poland ETF completed a closing agreement\nwith the IRS related to the recovery of\nforeign taxes received in fiscal years\n2017-2022, and the related tax compliance fee,\nincluding interest, was paid to the IRS.\nEffective October 16, 2024, the Syndicated\nCredit Agreement to which the Participating\nFunds are party was amended to extend the\nmaturity date to October 15, 2025 under the\nsame terms.\n\n73 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Trustees of\niShares Trust and Shareholders of each of the\nten funds listed in the table below Opinions\non the Financial Statements We have audited\nthe accompanying statements of assets and\nliabilities, including the schedules of\ninvestments, of each of the funds listed in\nthe table below (ten of the funds constituting\niShares Trust, hereafter collectively referred\nto as the \"Funds\") as of August 31, 2024, the\nrelated statements of operations for the year\nended August 31, 2024, the statements of\nchanges in net assets for each of the two\nyears in the period ended August 31, 2024,\nincluding the related notes, and the financial\nhighlights for each of the five years in the\nperiod ended August 31, 2024 (collectively\nreferred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

We conducted our audits of these\nfinancial statements in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements.

Regulation under\nthe Alternative Investment Fund Managers\nDirective The Alternative Investment Fund\nManagers Directive, and its United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d) equivalent, (the \u201cAIFMD\u201d) impose\ndetailed and prescriptive obligations on fund\nmanagers established in the European Union\n(the \u201cEU\u201d) and the UK. These do not currently\napply to managers established outside of the\nEU or UK, such as BFA (the \u201cCompany\u201d).\nHowever, the Company is required to comply\nwith certain disclosure, reporting and\ntransparency obligations of the AIFMD because\nit has registered the iShares MSCI China ETF\nand iShares MSCI Philippines ETF (the \u201cFunds\u201d)\nto be marketed to investors in the EU and/or\nUK. Report on Remuneration BlackRock has a\nclear and well-defined pay-for-performance\nphilosophy, and compensation programs which\nsupport that philosophy. BlackRock operates a\ntotal compensation model for remuneration\nwhich includes a base salary, which is\ncontractual, and a discretionary bonus scheme.\nAlthough all employees are eligible to receive\na discretionary bonus, there is no contractual\nobligation to make a discretionary bonus award\nto any employees. For senior management and\nstaff who have the ability to materially\naffect the risk profile of the Funds, a\nsignificant percentage of variable\nremuneration is deferred over time. All\nemployees are subject to a clawback policy.\nRemuneration decisions for employees are made\nonce annually in January following the end of\nthe performance year, based on BlackRock\u2019s\nfull-year financial results and other non-\nfinancial goals and objectives. Alongside\nfinancial performance, individual total\ncompensation is also based on strategic and\noperating results and other considerations\nsuch as management and leadership\ncapabilities. No set formulas are established\nand no fixed benchmarks are used in\ndetermining annual incentive awards. Annual\nincentive awards are paid from a bonus pool\nwhich is reviewed throughout the year by\nBlackRock's independent compensation\ncommittee, taking into account both actual and\nprojected financial information together with\ninformation provided by the Enterprise Risk\nand Regulatory Compliance departments in\nrelation to any activities, incidents or\nevents that warrant consideration in making\ncompensation decisions. Individuals are not\ninvolved in setting their own remuneration.\nEach of the control functions (Enterprise\nRisk, Legal & Compliance, Finance, Human\nResources and Internal Audit) each have their\nown organizational structures which are\nindependent of the business units and\ntherefore staff members in control functions\nare remunerated independently of the\nbusinesses they oversee. Functional bonus\npools for those control functions are\ndetermined with reference to the performance\nof each individual function and the\nremuneration of the senior members of control\nfunctions is directly overseen by BlackRock's\nindependent remuneration committee. The\nCompany is required under the AIFMD to make\nquantitative disclosures of remuneration.\nThese disclosures are made in line with\nBlackRock\u2019s interpretation of currently\navailable regulatory guidance on quantitative\nremuneration disclosures. As market or\nregulatory practice develops BlackRock may\nconsider it appropriate to make changes to the\nway in which quantitative remuneration\ndisclosures are calculated. Where such changes\nare made, this may result in disclosures in\nrelation to a fund not being comparable to the\ndisclosures made in the prior year, or in\nrelation to other BlackRock fund disclosures\nin that same year. BlackRock bases its\nproportionality approach on a combination of\nfactors that it is entitled to take into\naccount based on relevant guidelines.\nRemuneration information at an individual Fund\nlevel is not readily available. Disclosures\nare provided in relation to (a) the staff of\nthe Company; (b) staff who are senior\nmanagement; (c) staff who have the ability to\nmaterially affect the risk profile of the\nFunds; and (d) staff of companies to which\nportfolio management and risk management has\nbeen formally delegated. All individuals\nincluded in the aggregated figures disclosed\nare rewarded in line with BlackRock\u2019s\nremuneration policy for their responsibilities\nacross the relevant BlackRock business area.\nAs all individuals have a number of areas of\nresponsibilities, only the portion of\nremuneration for those individuals\u2019 services\nattributable to the Funds is included in the\naggregate figures disclosed. Members of staff\nand senior management of the Company typically\nprovide both AIFMD and non-AIFMD related\nservices in respect of multiple funds, clients\nand functions of the Company and across the\nbroader BlackRock group. Conversely, members\nof staff and senior management of the broader\nBlackRock group may provide both AIFMD and\nnon-AIFMD related services in respect of\nmultiple funds, clients and functions of the\nbroader BlackRock group and of the Company.\nTherefore, the figures disclosed are a sum of\nindividuals\u2019 portion of remuneration\nattributable to the Company according to an\nobjective apportionment methodology which\nacknowledges the multiple-service nature of\nthe Company and the broader BlackRock group.\nAccordingly, the figures are not\nrepresentative of any individual\u2019s actual\nremuneration or their remuneration structure.\nThe amount of the total remuneration awarded\nto the Company\u2019s staff in respect of the\nCompany\u2019s financial year ending December 31,\n2023 was USD 5.43m. This figure is comprised\nof fixed remuneration of USD 0.74m and\nvariable remuneration of USD 4.68m. There was\na total of 8 beneficiaries of the remuneration\ndescribed above. The amount of the aggregate\nremuneration awarded by the Company in respect\nof the Company\u2019s financial year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, to its senior management\nwas USD 3.66m, and to other members of its\nstaff whose actions potentially have a\nmaterial impact on the risk profile of the\nCompany or its funds was USD 1.77m.\n\nAdditional Information 76\n\nAdditional Information (continued)\n\nDisclosures Under the EU Sustainable Finance\nDisclosure Regulation The iShares MSCI China\nETF and iShares MSCI Philippines ETF (the\n\u201cFunds\u201d) are registered under the Alternative\nInvestment Fund Managers Directive to be\nmarketed to European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) investors,\nas noted above. As a result, certain\ndisclosures are required under the EU\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n(\u201cSFDR\u201d). Each Fund has not been categorized\nunder the SFDR as an \u201cArticle 8\u201d or \u201cArticle\n9\u201d product.

The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 78\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nmeeting and throughout the year, and matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services, as\nwell as BlackRock\u2019s continued investments in\nits ETF business. Based on review of this\ninformation, and the performance information\ndiscussed above, the Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of services\nprovided to the Fund under the Advisory\nAgreement supported the Board\u2019s approval of\nthe continuance of the Advisory Agreement for\nthe coming year. Costs of Services Provided to\nthe Fund and Profits Realized by BFA and its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed information\nabout the estimated profitability to BlackRock\nin managing the Fund, based on the fees\npayable to BFA and its affiliates (including\nfees under the Advisory Agreement), and other\nsources of revenue and expense to BFA and its\naffiliates from the Fund\u2019s operations for the\nlast calendar year. The Board reviewed\nBlackRock\u2019s methodology for calculating\nestimated profitability of the iShares funds,\nnoting that the 15(c) Committee and the Board\nhad focused on the methodology and\nprofitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by\n\n79 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an\naffiliate of BFA, and paid for by authorized\nparticipants under the ETF Servicing Platform.\nThe Board also noted the revenue received by\nBFA and/or its affiliates pursuant to an\nagreement that permits a service provider to\nuse certain portions of BlackRock\u2019s technology\nplatform to service accounts managed by BFA\nand/or its affiliates, including the iShares\nfunds. The Board noted that BFA generally does\nnot use soft dollars or consider the value of\nresearch or other services that may be\nprovided to BFA (including its affiliates) in\nselecting brokers for portfolio transactions\nfor the Fund. The Board concluded that any\nsuch ancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI China ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Under\nSection 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of\n1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's Board of\nTrustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority\nof Board Members who are not \u201cinterested\npersons\u201d of the Trust (as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act) (the \u201cIndependent Board\nMembers\u201d), is required annually to consider\nthe approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between the Trust and BFA (the\n\u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on behalf of the Fund.\nThe Board\u2019s consideration entails a year-long\nprocess whereby the Board and its committees\n(composed solely of Independent Board Members)\nassess BlackRock\u2019s services to the Fund,\nincluding investment management; fund\naccounting; administrative and shareholder\nservices; oversight of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders; risk management and oversight; and\nlegal and compliance services; including the\nability to meet applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements. The Independent Board\nMembers requested, and BFA provided, such\ninformation as the Independent Board Members,\nwith advice from independent counsel, deemed\nreasonably necessary to evaluate the Advisory\nAgreement. At meetings held on May 6, 2024 and\nMay 17, 2024, a committee composed of all of\nthe Independent Board Members (the \u201c15(c)\nCommittee\u201d), with independent counsel, met\nwith management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 80\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nthe scope of these services, the Board\nconsidered BFA\u2019s investment philosophy and\nexperience, noting that BFA and its affiliates\nhave committed significant resources over\ntime, including during the past year, to\nsupport the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and have made significant\ninvestments into the iShares business. The\nBoard also considered BFA\u2019s compliance program\nand its compliance record with respect to the\nFund, including related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund, as well as the\nresources available to them in managing the\nFund. In addition to the above considerations,\nthe Board reviewed and considered detailed\npresentations regarding BFA\u2019s investment\nperformance, investment and risk management\nprocesses and strategies provided at the May\n6, 2024 meeting and throughout the year, and\nmatters related to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance\nprogram and other compliance programs and\nservices, as well as BlackRock\u2019s continued\ninvestments in its ETF business. Based on\nreview of this information, and the\nperformance information discussed above, the\nBoard concluded that the nature, extent and\nquality of services provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the continuance of the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year. Costs of\nServices Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates\nmanage Other Accounts with substantially the\nsame investment objective and strategy as the\nFund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed.\n\n81 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nOther Benefits to BFA and/or its Affiliates:\nThe Board reviewed other benefits or ancillary\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\nin connection with the services provided to\nthe Fund by BFA, both direct and indirect,\nincluding, but not limited to, payment of\nrevenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nagent, for loaning portfolio securities, as\napplicable (which was included in the profit\nmargins reviewed by the Board pursuant to\nBFA\u2019s estimated profitability methodology),\npayment of advisory fees or other fees to BFA\n(or its affiliates) in connection with any\ninvestments by the Fund in other funds\n(including cash sweep vehicles) for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory services or other services, and\nBlackRock\u2019s profile in the investment\ncommunity. The Board further considered other\ndirect benefits that might accrue to BFA,\nincluding actual and potential reductions in\nthe Fund\u2019s expenses that are borne by BFA\nunder the \u201call-inclusive\u201d management fee\narrangement, due in part to the size and scope\nof BFA\u2019s investment operations servicing the\nFund (and other funds in the iShares complex)\nas well as in response to a changing market\nenvironment. The Board also reviewed and\nconsidered information provided by BFA\nconcerning authorized participant primary\nmarket order processing services that are\nprovided by BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of BFA, and paid for by\nauthorized participants under the ETF\nServicing Platform. The Board also noted the\nrevenue received by BFA and/or its affiliates\npursuant to an agreement that permits a\nservice provider to use certain portions of\nBlackRock\u2019s technology platform to service\naccounts managed by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board noted\nthat BFA generally does not use soft dollars\nor consider the value of research or other\nservices that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Indonesia ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Under\nSection 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of\n1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's Board of\nTrustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a majority\nof Board Members who are not \u201cinterested\npersons\u201d of the Trust (as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act) (the \u201cIndependent Board\nMembers\u201d), is required annually to consider\nthe approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between the Trust and BFA (the\n\u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on behalf of the Fund.\nThe Board\u2019s consideration entails a year-long\nprocess whereby the Board and its committees\n(composed solely of Independent Board Members)\nassess BlackRock\u2019s services to the Fund,\nincluding investment management; fund\naccounting; administrative and shareholder\nservices; oversight of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders; risk management and oversight; and\nlegal and compliance services; including the\nability to meet applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements. The Independent Board\nMembers requested, and BFA provided, such\ninformation as the Independent Board Members,\nwith advice from independent counsel, deemed\nreasonably necessary to evaluate the Advisory\nAgreement. At meetings held on May 6, 2024 and\nMay 17, 2024, a committee composed of all of\nthe Independent Board Members (the \u201c15(c)\nCommittee\u201d), with independent counsel, met\nwith management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were higher than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 82\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBased on this review, the other relevant\nfactors and information considered at the\nmeeting, and their general knowledge of ETF\npricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024 meeting and\nthroughout the year, and matters related to\nBFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program and other\ncompliance programs and services, as well as\nBlackRock\u2019s continued investments in its ETF\nbusiness. Based on review of this information,\nand the performance information discussed\nabove, the Board concluded that the nature,\nextent and quality of services provided to the\nFund under the Advisory Agreement supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year. Costs\nof Services Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that\n\n83 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nBFA and its affiliates do not manage Other\nAccounts with substantially the same\ninvestment objective and strategy as the Fund\nand that track the same index as the Fund. The\nBoard also acknowledged management\u2019s assertion\nthat, for certain iShares funds, and for\nclient segmentation purposes, BlackRock has\nlaunched an iShares fund that may provide a\nsimilar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates pursuant to an agreement that\npermits a service provider to use certain\nportions of BlackRock\u2019s technology platform to\nservice accounts managed by BFA and/or its\naffiliates, including the iShares funds. The\nBoard noted that BFA generally does not use\nsoft dollars or consider the value of research\nor other services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Philippines ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)\nUnder Section 15(c) of the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a\nmajority of Board Members who are not\n\u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust (as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) (the\n\u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is required\nannually to consider the approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund. The Board\u2019s consideration\nentails a year-long process whereby the Board\nand its committees (composed solely of\nIndependent Board Members) assess BlackRock\u2019s\nservices to the Fund, including investment\nmanagement; fund accounting; administrative\nand shareholder services; oversight of the\nFund\u2019s service providers; risk management and\noversight; and legal and compliance services;\nincluding the ability to meet applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Independent\nBoard Members requested, and BFA provided,\nsuch information as the Independent Board\nMembers, with advice from independent counsel,\ndeemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the\nAdvisory Agreement. At meetings held on May 6,\n2024 and May 17, 2024, a committee composed of\nall of the Independent Board Members (the\n\u201c15(c) Committee\u201d), with independent counsel,\nmet with management and reviewed and discussed\ninformation provided in response to initial\nrequests of the 15(c) Committee and/or its\nindependent counsel. Prior to and in\npreparation for the meeting, the Board\nreceived and reviewed materials specifically\nrelating to matters relevant to the renewal of\nthe Advisory Agreement. Following discussion,\nthe 15(c) Committee subsequently requested\ncertain additional information, which\nmanagement agreed to provide. At a meeting\nheld on June 4-5, 2024, the Board, including\nthe Independent Board Members, reviewed the\nadditional information provided by management\nin response to these requests. After extensive\ndiscussions and deliberations, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, approved the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund, based on a\nreview of qualitative and quantitative\ninformation provided by BFA and their\ncumulative experience as Board Members. The\nBoard noted its satisfaction with the extent\nand quality of information provided and its\nfrequent interactions with management, as well\nas the detailed responses and other\ninformation provided by BFA. The Independent\nBoard Members were advised by their\nindependent counsel throughout the process,\nincluding about the legal standards applicable\nto their review. In approving the continuance\nof the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses and performance of\nthe Fund; (ii) the nature, extent and quality\nof the services provided by BFA; (iii) the\ncosts of services provided to the Fund and\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates;\n(iv) potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The Board Members did\nnot identify any particular information or any\nsingle factor as determinative, and each Board\nMember may have attributed different weights\nto the various matters and factors considered.\nThe material factors, considerations and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement are discussed below.\nExpenses and Performance of the Fund: The\nBoard reviewed statistical information\nprepared by Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent provider\nof investment company data, regarding the\nexpense ratio components, including gross and\nnet total expenses, fees and expenses of other\nfund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 84\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nin all instances. The Board also noted that\nthe investment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were higher than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024 meeting and\nthroughout the year, and matters related to\nBFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program and other\ncompliance programs and services, as well as\nBlackRock\u2019s continued investments in its ETF\nbusiness. Based on review of this information,\nand the performance information discussed\nabove, the Board concluded that the nature,\nextent and quality of services provided to the\nFund under the Advisory Agreement supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year. Costs\nof Services Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the provision of\nadditional infrastructure and services to the\niShares funds and their shareholders and, with\nrespect to New Funds, set management fees at\nlevels that anticipate scale over time. The\nBoard noted that the Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund already provided for breakpoints in\nthe Fund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate as the\nassets of the Fund, on an aggregated basis\nwith the assets of certain other iShares\nfunds, increase. The Board noted that it would\ncontinue to assess the appropriateness of\nadding new or revised breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year.\n\n85 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nFees and Services Provided for Other\nComparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA and\nits Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates\nmanage Other Accounts with substantially the\nsame investment objective and strategy as the\nFund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates pursuant to an agreement that\npermits a service provider to use certain\nportions of BlackRock\u2019s technology platform to\nservice accounts managed by BFA and/or its\naffiliates, including the iShares funds. The\nBoard noted that BFA generally does not use\nsoft dollars or consider the value of research\nor other services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\niShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)\nUnder Section 15(c) of the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), including a\nmajority of Board Members who are not\n\u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust (as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) (the\n\u201cIndependent Board Members\u201d), is required\nannually to consider the approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement between the\nTrust and BFA (the \u201cAdvisory Agreement\u201d) on\nbehalf of the Fund.

The material\nfactors, considerations and conclusions that\nformed the basis for the Board, including the\nIndependent Board Members, to approve the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement are\ndiscussed below. Expenses and Performance of\nthe Fund: The Board reviewed statistical\ninformation prepared by Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an independent\nprovider of investment company data, regarding\nthe expense ratio components, including gross\nand net total expenses, fees and expenses of\nother fund(s) in which the Fund invests (if\napplicable), and waivers/reimbursements (if\napplicable) of the Fund in comparison with the\nsame information for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that, due to the limitations in\nproviding comparable funds in the Peer Group,\nthe statistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances. The Board also noted that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and overall\nexpenses (net of any waivers and\nreimbursements) for the Fund were lower than\nthe median of the investment advisory fee\nrates and overall expenses (net of any waivers\nand reimbursements) of the funds in its Peer\nGroup, excluding iShares funds. In addition,\nto the extent that any of the comparison funds\nincluded in the Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds, track the same index as the Fund,\nBroadridge also provided, and the Board\nreviewed, a comparison of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance for the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, ten-year, and since inception\nperiods, as applicable, and for the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, to that of such\nrelevant comparison fund(s) for the same\nperiods. The Board noted that the Fund seeks\nto track its specified underlying index and\nthat, during the year, the Board received\nperiodic reports on the Fund\u2019s short- and\nlonger-term performance in comparison with its\nunderlying index. Such periodic comparative\nperformance information, including additional\ndetailed information as requested by the\nBoard, was also considered. The Board noted\nthat the Fund generally performed in line with\nits underlying index over the relevant\nperiods. Based on this review, the other\nrelevant factors and information considered at\nthe meeting, and their general knowledge of\nETF pricing, the Board concluded that the\ninvestment advisory fee rate and expense level\nand the historical performance of the Fund\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Nature, Extent and Quality of\nServices Provided: Based on management\u2019s\nrepresentations, including information about\nongoing enhancements and initiatives with\nrespect to the iShares product line and BFA\u2019s\nbusiness, including with respect to capital\nmarkets support and analysis, technology,\nportfolio management, product design and\nquality, compliance and risk management,\nglobal public policy and other services, the\nBoard expected that there would be no\ndiminution in the scope of services required\nof or provided by BFA under the Advisory\nAgreement for the coming year as compared with\nthe scope of services provided by BFA during\nprior years. In reviewing the scope of these\nservices, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time, including\nduring the past year, to support the iShares\nfunds and their shareholders and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness. The Board also considered BFA\u2019s\ncompliance program and its compliance record\nwith respect to the Fund, including related\nprograms implemented pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, the Board noted\nthat BFA reports to the Board about portfolio\nmanagement and compliance matters on a\nperiodic basis in connection with regularly\nscheduled meetings of the Board, and on other\noccasions as necessary and appropriate, and\nhas provided information and made relevant\nofficers and other employees of BFA (and its\naffiliates) available as needed to provide\nfurther assistance with these matters. The\nBoard also reviewed the background and\nexperience of the persons responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund, as well as\nthe resources available to them in managing\nthe Fund. In addition to the above\nconsiderations, the Board reviewed and\nconsidered detailed presentations regarding\nBFA\u2019s investment performance, investment and\nrisk management processes and strategies\nprovided at the May 6, 2024 meeting and\nthroughout the year, and matters related to\nBFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program and other\ncompliance programs and services, as well as\nBlackRock\u2019s continued investments in its ETF\nbusiness. Based on review of this information,\nand the performance information discussed\nabove, the Board concluded that the nature,\nextent and quality of services provided to the\nFund under the Advisory Agreement supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year. Costs\nof Services Provided to the Fund and Profits\nRealized by BFA and its Affiliates: The Board\nreviewed information about the estimated\nprofitability to BlackRock in managing the\nFund, based on the fees payable to BFA and its\naffiliates (including fees under the Advisory\nAgreement), and other sources of revenue and\nexpense to BFA and its affiliates from the\nFund\u2019s operations for the last calendar year.\nThe Board reviewed BlackRock\u2019s methodology for\ncalculating estimated profitability of the\niShares funds, noting that the 15(c) Committee\nand the Board had focused on the methodology\nand profitability presentation. The Board\nrecognized that profitability may be affected\nby numerous factors, including, among other\nthings, fee waivers by BFA, the types of funds\nmanaged, expense allocations and business mix.\nThe Board thus recognized that calculating and\ncomparing profitability at individual fund\nlevels is challenging. The Board discussed\nwith management the sources of direct and\nancillary revenue, including the revenues to\nBTC, a BlackRock affiliate, from securities\nlending by the Fund. The Board also discussed\nBFA\u2019s estimated profit margin as reflected in\nthe Fund\u2019s profitability analysis and reviewed\ninformation regarding potential economies of\nscale (as discussed below). Based on this\nreview, the Board concluded that the\ninformation considered with respect to the\nprofits realized by BFA and its affiliates\nunder the Advisory Agreement and from other\nrelationships between the Fund and BFA and/or\nits affiliates, if any, and related costs of\nthe services provided as well as the other\nfactors considered at the meeting, supported\nthe Board\u2019s approval of the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\nEconomies of Scale: The Board reviewed\ninformation and considered the extent to which\neconomies of scale might be realized as the\nassets of the Fund increase, noting that the\nissue of potential economies of scale had been\nfocused on by the 15(c) Committee and the\nBoard during their meetings and addressed by\nmanagement. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreceived information regarding BlackRock\u2019s\nhistorical estimated profitability (as\ndiscussed above), including BFA\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 estimated costs in providing\nservices. The estimated cost information\ndistinguished, among other things, between\nfixed and variable costs, and showed how the\nlevel and nature of fixed and variable costs\nmay impact the existence or size of scale\nbenefits, with the Board recognizing that\npotential economies of scale are difficult to\nmeasure. The 15(c) Committee and the Board\nreviewed information provided by BFA regarding\nthe sharing of scale benefits with the iShares\nfunds through various means, including, as\napplicable, through breakpoints, waivers, or\nother fee reductions, as well as through\nadditional investment in the iShares business,\nincluding enhancements to or the\n\n87 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\n\nprovision of additional infrastructure and\nservices to the iShares funds and their\nshareholders and, with respect to New Funds,\nset management fees at levels that anticipate\nscale over time. The Board noted that the\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund did not\nprovide for breakpoints in the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment advisory fee rate as the assets of\nthe Fund increase. However, the Board noted\nthat it would continue to assess the\nappropriateness of adding breakpoints in the\nfuture. The Board concluded that this review\nof potential economies of scale and the\nsharing of related benefits, as well as the\nother factors considered at the meeting,\nsupported the Board\u2019s approval of the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Fees and Services Provided for\nOther Comparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates: The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board received detailed information\nregarding how the Other Accounts generally\ndiffer from the Fund, including in terms of\nthe types of services and generally more\nextensive character and scope of services\nprovided to the Fund, as well as other\nsignificant differences. In that regard, the\nBoard considered that the pricing of services\nto institutional clients is typically based on\na number of factors beyond the nature and\nextent of the specific services to be provided\nand often depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding other services to the Fund, as a\npublicly traded investment vehicle, as\ncompared to the Other Accounts, particularly\nthose that are institutional clients, in light\nof differing regulatory requirements and\nclient-imposed mandates. The Board\nacknowledged BFA\u2019s representation that the\niShares funds are fundamentally different\ninvestment vehicles from the Other Accounts in\nits consideration of relevant qualitative and\nquantitative comparative information provided.\nThe Board noted that BFA and its affiliates do\nnot manage Other Accounts with substantially\nthe same investment objective and strategy as\nthe Fund and that track the same index as the\nFund. The Board also acknowledged management\u2019s\nassertion that, for certain iShares funds, and\nfor client segmentation purposes, BlackRock\nhas launched an iShares fund that may provide\na similar investment exposure at a lower\ninvestment advisory fee rate. The Board\nconsidered the \u201call-inclusive\u201d nature of the\nFund\u2019s advisory fee structure, and the Fund\u2019s\nexpenses borne by BFA under this arrangement\nand noted that the investment advisory fee\nrate under the Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwas generally higher than the investment\nadvisory/management fee rates for certain of\nthe Other Accounts (particularly institutional\nclients) and concluded that the differences\nappeared to be consistent with the factors\ndiscussed. Other Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates: The Board reviewed other benefits\nor ancillary revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nprovided to the Fund by BFA, both direct and\nindirect, including, but not limited to,\npayment of revenue to BTC, the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending agent, for loaning\nportfolio securities, as applicable (which was\nincluded in the profit margins reviewed by the\nBoard pursuant to BFA\u2019s estimated\nprofitability methodology), payment of\nadvisory fees or other fees to BFA (or its\naffiliates) in connection with any investments\nby the Fund in other funds (including cash\nsweep vehicles) for which BFA (or its\naffiliates) provides investment advisory\nservices or other services, and BlackRock\u2019s\nprofile in the investment community. The Board\nfurther considered other direct benefits that\nmight accrue to BFA, including actual and\npotential reductions in the Fund\u2019s expenses\nthat are borne by BFA under the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d management fee arrangement, due in\npart to the size and scope of BFA\u2019s investment\noperations servicing the Fund (and other funds\nin the iShares complex) as well as in response\nto a changing market environment. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that are provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nalso noted the revenue received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates pursuant to an agreement that\npermits a service provider to use certain\nportions of BlackRock\u2019s technology platform to\nservice accounts managed by BFA and/or its\naffiliates, including the iShares funds. The\nBoard noted that BFA generally does not use\nsoft dollars or consider the value of research\nor other services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the\ncontinuance of the Advisory Agreement for the\ncoming year. Conclusion: Based on a review of\nthe factors described above, as well as such\nother factors as deemed appropriate by the\nBoard, the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, determined that the\nFund\u2019s investment advisory fee rate under the\nAdvisory Agreement does not constitute a fee\nthat is so disproportionately large as to bear\nno reasonable relationship to the services\nrendered and that could not have been the\nproduct of arm\u2019s-length bargaining, and\nconcluded to approve the continuance of the\nAdvisory Agreement for the coming year.\n\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract 88\n\nGlossary of Terms Used in this Report\n                                      \n        Portfolio Abbreviation        \n  ADR   American Depositary Receipt   \n  JSC   Joint Stock Company           \n  NVS   Non-Voting Shares             \n  PJSC  Public Joint Stock Company    \n  REIT  Real Estate Investment Trust  \n                                      \n89 2024 iShares Annual Financial Statements\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 This report is intended for the\nFunds\u2019 shareholders.
