Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund's pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\nFund's total return but is not included in the\nFund's ratio of expenses to average net\nassets. Both figures are shown in the\nFinancial Highlights section of the Fund's\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any,\nattributable to investments by the Fund in\nother funds advised by BFA, or its affiliates,\nthrough November 30, 2030. The contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to November 30,\n2030only upon written agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n                    Acqu\u2026        Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  Dist\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Tot\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n       (12b\u2026        Expe\u2026  Ann\u2026  Expe\u2026  Wai\u2026  \n                                        Exp\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.03%  0.5\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.5\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. 3 Based on estimated amounts\nfor the current fiscal year. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $51        $160  \n                   \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may pay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when they buy and sell securities\n(or \u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may indicate higher\ntransaction costs and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to incur increased\nexpenses. These costs, which are not reflected\nin the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in\nthe Example (except costs to the Underlying\nFund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\nBecause the Fund is new, there is no\nreportable turnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to provide certain\npre-determined outcomes (the \u201c Outcomes \u201d )\nbased on the performance of the iShares Core\nS&P 500 ETF (the \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d ) for\ninvestors who hold Fund shares over a full\ncalendar quarter (the \u201c Outcome Period \u201d ).\nThe Outcomes sought by the Fund are: \u25a0\nApproximately twice the share price return of\nthe Underlying Fund (the \u201c Accelerated Return\n\u201d ), up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), and \u25a0 Downside\nperformance that approximately tracks, one for\none, the negative share price return of the\nUnderlying Fund. The Outcomes are intended to\nbe realized only by investors who hold Fund\nshares at the outset of the Outcome Period and\ncontinue to hold the shares through the end of\nthe Outcome Period. Specifically, in order to\nhold Fund shares for the entirety of an\nOutcome Period, an investor must buy or\ncontinue holding shares at the close on the\nlast trading day of the prior Outcome Period\nand sell or continue holding the shares at the\nclose on the last trading day of the current\nOutcome Period. If investors buy Fund shares\nafter the start of the Outcome Period or sell\nFund shares before the Outcome Period\nconcludes, they may experience returns that\ndiffer significantly from the Outcomes. These\ninclude experiencing little or no gains\nrelated to the Accelerated Return or the\nUnderlying Fund and losses that are greater\nthan the Underlying Fund\u2019s losses. The\nOutcomes may not be achieved, and investors\nmay lose some or all of their money. The Fund\ndoes not provide a buffer, floor or other\nprotection against losses. The Fund will be\noffered indefinitely and is not intended to\nterminate after one or more Outcome Periods.\nThe Current Outcome Period For the current\nOutcome Period of April 1, 2025 through June\n30, 2025, the Approximate Cap is 7.58%, before\ntaking into account any fees or expenses\ncharged to, or transaction costs incurred by,\nthe Fund or the Underlying Fund. When the\nFund\u2019s annualized management fee of 0.50% of\nits average daily net assets is taken into\naccount, the Approximate Cap for the current\nOutcome Period is reduced to 7.46%. The\nreturns that the Fund seeks to provide do not\ntake into account the costs associated with\nbuying shares of the Underlying Fund and any\nother expenses incurred by the Fund. Please\nvisit the Fund\u2019s page on www.iShares.com for\nmore information about the potential outcomes\nof an investment in the Fund during the\ncurrent Outcome Period, including the\nremaining Approximate Cap. The Underlying Fund\nThe Underlying Fund is the iShares Core S&P\n500 ETF (Ticker: IVV). It is an ETF that seeks\nto track the investment results of the S&P 500\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Fund\u2019s Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of the large-\ncapitalization sector of the U.S. equity\nmarket, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC. The securities in the Underlying\nFund\u2019s Index represent a broad range of\nindustries and are weighted based on the\nfloat-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The components of the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index are likely to change\nover time. BFA is the investment adviser to\nthe Underlying Fund and receives a management\nfee from the Underlying Fund. BFA manages the\nUnderlying Fund using a \u201c representative\nsampling \u201d indexing strategy. This involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying Fund may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s performance to diverge from\nthat of the index and produce \u201c tracking\nerror. \u201d Tracking error risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions. The\nprospectus and other reports of the Underlying\nFund are available at www.sec.gov and\nwww.iShares.com . Shares of the Underlying\nFund are listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. The Fund\u2019s\nUse of Options The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying Fund and customized\ncall options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying Fund. The\noptions in which the Fund transacts\n(typically, equity or index exchange-traded\noptions contracts) are referred to generally\nas Flexible Exchange Options ( \u201c FLEX Options\n\u201d ). The Fund may transact in other exchange-\ntraded options that reference the price\nperformance of the Underlying Fund, the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index or other ETFs that\ntrack the Underlying Fund\u2019s Index. An options\ncontract is an agreement between a buyer and\nseller that gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right but not the obligation to buy (in\nthe case of a call option) or sell (in the\ncase of a put option) a particular financial\ninstrument at a specified future date for an\nagreed-upon price, commonly known as the \u201c\nstrike price \u201d . When the Fund buys a call\noption, it pays a premium and receives the\nright, but not the obligation, to purchase\nshares of the Underlying Fund or other\nreference asset at a strike price by or on the\nexpiration date. If the Fund buys a put\noption, it pays a premium and receives the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell shares\nof the Underlying Fund or other reference\nasset at a strike price by or on the\nexpiration date. When the Fund writes (sells)\na call option, it receives a premium and gives\nthe purchaser of the option the right to\npurchase from the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying Fund or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date. If\nthe Fund writes (sells) a put option, it\nreceives a premium and gives the purchaser S-2\nof the option the right to sell to the Fund\nshares of the Underlying Fund or other\nreference asset at a strike price by or on\nexpiration date. FLEX Options provide the\nability to customize key option contract terms\nsuch as strike price, style and expiration\ndate. The options in which the Fund invests\nare European style, meaning they are\nexercisable at the strike price only on the\nexpiration date. The Fund typically trades\noptions that expire at or around the end of\neach Outcome Period. As an in-the-money option\nheld by the Fund approaches its expiration\ndate, its value typically will increasingly\nmove with the value of its reference asset,\nsuch as the Underlying Fund. However, the\nvalue of the options may change because of\nfactors other than the value of the reference\nasset, including interest rate changes,\ndividends, the actual and perceived volatility\nof the reference asset, the remaining time\nuntil the options expire, limitations\nestablished by options exchanges, and trading\nconditions in the options market, among\nothers. Due to these factors, the value of the\noptions typically does not increase or\ndecrease at the same rate as the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price on a day-to-day basis. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s net asset value per share (\n\u201c NAV \u201d ) may not increase or decrease at the\nsame rate as the Underlying Fund\u2019s share\nprice. Options positions are marked to market\ndaily by the Fund. The value of the options\ntraded by the Fund is determined based upon\nmarket quotations or other recognized pricing\nmethods. The options traded by the Fund are\nlisted on an exchange, including the Chicago\nBoard Options Exchange. The options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees the performance\nby counterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts. The OCC may make adjustments to\nFLEX Options for certain significant events.\nOutcomes Targeted by the Fund For each Outcome\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying Fund by holding\nshares of the Underlying Fund and futures that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index. The Accelerated\nReturn and Approximate Cap are typically\ncreated by trading a set of call options, as\ndescribed below, at the close of the last\ntrading day of the prior Outcome Period.\nAccelerated Return . The Fund creates the\nAccelerated Return by buying a call option\nwith a strike price that is approximately at-\nthe-money relative to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshare price (the \u201c ATM Call \u201d ). This exposure\nto the Underlying Fund, combined with the\nFund\u2019s investment in shares of the Underlying\nFund and futures on the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex, creates the approximately double upside\nreturn. Approximate Cap . The Fund creates the\nApproximate Cap by selling a call option that\nis two times the notional value of the ATM\nCall and that has a higher, out-of-the-money\nstrike price relative to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshare price (the \u201c Cap Option \u201d ). The Cap\nOption\u2019s higher strike price prevents the Fund\nfrom realizing the benefit of any increase in\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s share price above that\nstrike price. The Approximate Cap for an\nOutcome Period is approximately twice the\nupside return implied by the strike price of\nthe Cap Option for that Outcome Period. The\nstrike price for the Cap Option depends on the\nmarket conditions when the option is sold and\nlikely will be different for each Outcome\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Outcome Period. The Fund uses the\npremium collected from selling the Cap Option\nand the expected dividend distributions from\nthe Underlying Fund to cover the premium that\nit pays to buy the ATM Call. The Fund\u2019s\nAccelerated Return and Approximate Cap (net of\nthe management fee) for the current Outcome\nPeriod, along with the Fund\u2019s current position\nrelative to the Outcomes, are available and\nupdated daily on the Fund\u2019s page on\nwww.iShares.com . On the last trading day of\neach Outcome Period, the Fund will trade a new\nset of call options to create the Accelerated\nReturn and Approximate Cap for the next\nOutcome Period. After the close of business on\nthe last trading day of the Outcome Period,\nthe Fund will file a prospectus supplement\nthat discloses the Approximate Cap (gross and\nnet of its management fee) for the next\nOutcome Period. Outcome Period The Outcomes\nfor an Outcome Period apply only to Fund\nshares that are held over the entire Outcome\nPeriod. An investor who purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of an Outcome Period or\nwho sells Fund shares before the end of an\nOutcome Period may not fully realize the\nApproximate Cap for the Outcome Period and may\nexperience price returns that are different\nfrom the Outcomes. This is because, while the\nOutcomes are fixed levels that are calculated\nin relation to the Underlying Fund\u2019s price and\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of that Outcome\nPeriod and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Outcome Period, an investor who\ntransacts in Fund shares during the Outcome\nPeriod will likely do so at a price that is\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of\nthe Outcome Period. For example, if an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares during an\nOutcome Period at a time when the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price has increased from its\nprice at the beginning of the Outcome Period,\nthe investor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than\nthe Approximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses that exceed the losses of\nthe Underlying Fund for the remainder of the\nOutcome Period. Conversely, if an investor\npurchases Fund shares during an Outcome Period\nat a time when the Underlying Fund\u2019s share\nprice has decreased from its price at the\nbeginning of the Outcome Period, the Fund may\nrequire a larger increase in the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price before it reaches the\nAccelerated Return. Fund and Underlying Fund\nPerformance If there are any inflows, or\ncreation transactions, for the Fund during an\nOutcome Period, the Fund typically will buy\nUnderlying Fund shares and futures on the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index and will seek to trade\nthe same set of call options as described\nabove. This will occur even in circumstances\nwhere the Fund would receive a negligible\npremium for selling an out-of-the-money call,\nwhich may give up more sizable returns to the\nextent that the option later becomes in the\nmoney. Because the Fund uses distributions\nfrom the Underlying Fund to purchase the ATM\nCall, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely to be\nless than the Underlying Fund\u2019s performance\nwhen (1) distributions are considered and (2)\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s performance is less than\nhalf of its distributions or is negative. The\nFund may also S-3 underperform the Underlying\nFund if the returns of the Underlying Fund\nexceed the Approximate Cap net of the\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s market value and NAV\nmay not correlate with the Underlying Fund and\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s Index. In periods of\nextreme market volatility, the Fund\u2019s return\nmay be subject to an upside limit\nsignificantly below the Approximate Cap and a\ndownside that is significantly greater than\nthe price return of the Underlying Fund.\nInvestors may lose their entire investment,\nand an investment in the Fund is appropriate\nonly for investors willing to bear those\nlosses. In order to obtain economic exposure\nto the Underlying Fund, in lieu of purchasing\nUnderlying Fund shares and futures on the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index for an Outcome Period,\nthe Fund may instead do one or more of the\nfollowing, among other things: \u25a0 purchase one\nor more other ETFs that seek to track the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index; \u25a0 purchase equity\nsecurities ( e.g ., component securities of\nthe Underlying Fund or the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying Fund; or \u25a0 invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying Fund. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nFund), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in the common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying Fund that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying Fund. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large-capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the Accelerated\nReturn or for the Approximate Cap with respect\nto securities of large-capitalization\ncompanies. For purposes of the Fund\u2019s 80%\npolicy, \u201c large-capitalization companies \u201d are\nthose within the range of capitalization of\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s Index. Summary of\nPrincipal Risks The Fund has characteristics\nunlike many traditional products and may not\nbe appropriate for all investors. As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the Fund's\nperformance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Fund), any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund's NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nAccelerated Return Risk. There can be no\nguarantee that the Fund will be successful in\nits strategy to provide approximately twice\nthe positive share price return, if any, of\nthe Underlying Fund over an Outcome Period,\nsubject to an Approximate Cap. If an investor\npurchases Fund shares after the beginning of\nan Outcome Period or does not stay invested in\nthe Fund for the entirety of the Outcome\nPeriod, the returns realized by the investor\nmay not match those that the Fund seeks to\nachieve. Approximate Cap Risk. The Fund\u2019s\nstrategy seeks to provide returns that are\nsubject to an Approximate Cap, whose level\ndepends on prevailing market conditions ( e.g\n., volatility, interest rates, dividends, and\nother factors) at the time that the\nApproximate Cap is set. The Approximate Cap\nmay rise or fall from one Outcome Period to\nthe next, sometimes to a significant extent,\nand is unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Outcome Periods. If the Underlying\nFund experiences gains in excess of the\nApproximate Cap for an Outcome Period, the\nFund will not participate in any gains beyond\nthe Approximate Cap and will underperform the\nUnderlying Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be\nsignificantly below the Approximate Cap.\nOptions Risk. Investments in options are\nconsidered speculative. When the Fund\npurchases an option, it may lose the total\npremium paid for it if the price of the\nunderlying security or other reference asset\nrelated to the option decreased, remained the\nsame or failed to increase to a level at or\nbeyond the exercise price (in the case of a\ncall option) or increased, remained the same\nor failed to decrease to a level at or below\nthe exercise price (in the case of a put\noption). When the Fund sells an option, it may\nexperience a substantial loss if the price of\nthe underlying security or other reference\nasset increased to a level significantly above\nthe exercise price (in the case of a call\noption) or decreased to a level significantly\nbelow the exercise price (in the case of a put\noption). If a put or call option purchased by\nthe Fund were permitted to expire without\nbeing sold or exercised, its premium would\nrepresent a loss to the Fund. FLEX Options\nRisk. FLEX Options are subject to the risk\nthat they may be less liquid than certain\nother securities, such as standardized\noptions. In less liquid markets for the FLEX\nOptions, terminating FLEX Options may require\nthe payment of a premium or acceptance of a\ndiscounted price and may take longer to\ncomplete. In a less liquid market for FLEX\nOptions, the liquidation of a large number of\noptions may significantly impact the price of\nthe options and may adversely impact the value\nof an investment in the Fund. There is also a\nrisk that the Fund will be unable to maintain\nthe proportional relationship based on the\nnumber of exchange-traded options in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio or that adverse tax law\nchanges will negatively impact the treatment\nof FLEX Options. Additionally, to the extent\nmarket participants are not willing or able to\nenter into FLEX Option transactions with the\nFund at prices that reflect the market price\nof Fund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and the share\nprice of the Fund could be negatively\nimpacted. Risk of Investing in the U.S .\nInvesting in U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. Certain changes in the U.S., such\nas a weakening of the U.S. economy or a\ndecline in its financial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The S-4 performance\nof large-capitalization companies could trail\nthe overall performance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Asset Class Risk. The securities and\nother assets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular financial\nmarket, an index, or other asset classes.\nAssets Under Management (AUM) Risk . From time\nto time, an Authorized Participant (as defined\nbelow in Authorized Participant Concentration\nRisk ), a third-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\nor another fund may invest in the Fund and\nhold its investment for a specific period of\ntime to allow the Fund to achieve size or\nscale. There can be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could negatively impact the\nFund. Authorized Participant Concentration\nRisk. An \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of its service\nproviders that allows the Authorized\nParticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of creation units ( \u201c Creation\nUnits \u201d ). Only an Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption transactions\ndirectly with the Fund. There are a limited\nnumber of institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the Fund,\nincluding on an agency basis on behalf of\nother market participants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to engage in creation\nor redemption transactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the business or\ndo not place creation or redemption orders for\nthe Fund and no other Authorized Participant\nplaces orders, Fund shares are more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV and\npossibly face trading halts or delisting.\nClearing Member Default Risk. Transactions in\nsome types of derivatives, including FLEX\nOptions and futures, are required to be\ncentrally cleared ( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ).\nIn a transaction involving cleared\nderivatives, the Fund\u2019s counterparty is a\nclearing house, such as the OCC, rather than a\nbank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member\nof clearing houses and only members of a\nclearing house ( \u201c clearing members \u201d ) can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund will hold cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives positions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\ntheir accounts at clearing members. Customer\nfunds held at a clearing organization in\nconnection with any options contracts are held\nin a commingled omnibus account and are not\nidentified to the name of the clearing\nmember\u2019s individual customers. As a result,\nassets deposited by the Fund with any clearing\nmember as margin for FLEX Options or futures\nmay, in certain circumstances, be used to\nsatisfy losses of other clients of the Fund\u2019s\nclearing member. In addition, although\nclearing members guarantee performance of\ntheir clients\u2019 obligations to the Underlying\nETF, the Fund's or the Underlying ETF's\nclearing house, there is a risk that the\nassets of the Fund might not be fully\nprotected in the event of the clearing\nmember\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund would be\nlimited to recovering only a pro rata share of\nall available funds segregated on behalf of\nthe clearing member\u2019s customers for the\nrelevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives are\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the\noptions held by the Fund. As a result, the\nability of the Fund to meet its objective\ndepends on the OCC being able to meet its\nobligations. In the unlikely event that the\nOCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable\nto meet its clearing and settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which\nmay cause such investments to lose value.\nDerivatives Risk. The Fund\u2019s use of\nderivatives ( e.g ., futures, forwards, swaps,\noptions) may be riskier than other types of\ninvestments and may not have the intended\neffect on the Fund\u2019s performance. Derivatives\ncan be sensitive to changes in economic and\nmarket conditions, and they may increase the\nFund\u2019s volatility. The Fund also may\nexperience reduced returns as a result of\ntransaction costs and losses on derivatives\npositions. There is the risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between the value of a derivative\nand that of the asset underlying the\nderivative. Derivatives may create investment\nleverage, which could result in losses that\nsignificantly exceed the Fund\u2019s original\ninvestment. Derivatives are subject to the\nrisk of mispricing or improper S-5 valuation,\nparticularly if there is not a liquid\nsecondary market for the instrument. Certain\nderivatives are subject to counterparty risk,\nwhich is the risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. The use of derivatives also\nexposes the Fund to additional operational and\nlegal risks. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Futures\nContract Risk. Futures are standardized,\nexchange-traded contracts that obligate a\npurchaser to take delivery, and a seller to\nmake delivery, of a specific amount of an\nasset at a specified future date at a\nspecified price. Unlike equities, which\ntypically entitle the holder to a continuing\nownership stake in an issuer, futures\ncontracts normally specify a certain date for\nsettlement in cash based on the level of the\nreference rate. The primary risks associated\nwith the use of futures contracts are: (i) the\nimperfect correlation between the change in\nmarket value of the instruments held by the\nFund and the price of the futures contract;\n(ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary\nmarket for a futures contract and the\nresulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA\u2019s inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations.\nInvestment in Underlying Fund Risk. The Fund\ninvests in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance and risks are likely to\nbe directly related to those of the Underlying\nFund. The Fund\u2019s NAV will change with changes\nin the value of the Underlying Fund and other\nassets that the Fund holds. The shares of the\nUnderlying Fund may trade at a premium or\ndiscount to the Underlying Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors in the Fund will indirectly bear the\nexpenses charged by the Underlying Fund, and\nan investment in the Fund may entail more\nexpenses than a direct investment in the\nUnderlying Fund. Issuer Risk . The performance\nof the Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.\nCertain shareholders of the Fund, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold\ntheir investment in the Fund for a limited\nperiod of time. There can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares could require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption requests,\nwhich can accelerate the realization of\ntaxable income and/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may\nbe treated as receiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some circumstances,\nthe Fund may hold a relatively large\nproportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques, models and/or\nrisk analyses applied by BFA will not produce\nthe desired results. The securities or other\nassets selected by BFA may result in returns\nthat are inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective, and the Fund may\nunderperform the market or any relevant\nbenchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing the Fund and may\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\nachieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Outcome Period\nRisk. The Approximate Cap for an Outcome\nPeriod applies to Fund shares held over the\nentire Outcome Period. If an investor\npurchases Fund shares after an Outcome Period\nbegins or sells Fund shares prior to the end\nof an Outcome S-6 Period, the returns realized\nby the investor will not match those that the\nFund seeks to provide. Small Fund Risk. When\nthe Fund\u2019s size is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume and wide bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could lead to elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Tax Risk. The Fund intends\nto elect and to qualify each year to be\ntreated as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) under Subchapter M of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ). As a RIC, the\nFund will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on the portion of its net\ninvestment income and net capital gains that\nit distributes to shareholders, provided that\nit satisfies certain requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code. However, the federal\nincome tax treatment of certain aspects of the\nFund\u2019s operations are not entirely clear. This\nincludes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s options\nstrategy, its hedging strategy, the\napplication of the \u201c straddle \u201d rules, and\nvarious loss limitation provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code. To qualify and maintain\nits status as a RIC, the Fund must meet\ncertain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. In\nparticular, there is no published Internal\nRevenue Service ( \u201c IRS \u201d ) guidance or case\nlaw on how to determine the \u201c issuer \u201d of\ncertain derivatives that the Fund will enter\ninto. Based upon the language in the\nlegislative history, the Fund intends to treat\nthe reference asset (i.e ., the Underlying\nFund) as the issuer of the options. Assuming\nthe reference asset qualifies as a RIC, the\nFund could count the options as automatically\ndiversified investments under the RIC\ndiversification requirements. The Fund intends\nto treat any income it may derive from the\noptions as \u201c qualifying income \u201d under the\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\napplicable to RICs. If the income is not\nqualifying income or the issuer of the options\nis not appropriately the reference asset, the\nFund may not qualify, or may be disqualified,\nas a RIC. If the Fund does not qualify as a\nRIC for any taxable year and certain relief\nprovisions are not available, the Fund\u2019s\ntaxable income will be subject to tax at the\nFund level and to a further tax at the\nshareholder level when such income is\ndistributed. Technology Companies Risk .\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Valuation Risk .\nThe price that the Fund could receive upon the\nsale (or other disposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. In addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the Prospectus,\nthe Fund has not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance information to\nreport. S-7 Management Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors. Portfolio Managers.\nMatthew DeCicco and Orlando Montalvo (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Mr. DeCicco and Mr.\nMontalvo have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2025. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan individual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ),\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-8\n\nMore Information About the Fund This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Fund listed below.\nPlease read this Prospectus carefully before\nyou make any investment decisions.

ETFs are funds that trade like\nother publicly traded securities. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national securities\nexchange and trade in the secondary market at\nmarket prices that change throughout the day.\nThe market price for a share of the Fund may\nbe different from the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV.\nThe Fund invests in a particular segment of\nthe markets for securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and is designed to\nbe used as part of broader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an investment in the\nFund should not constitute a complete\ninvestment program. An investment in the Fund\nis not a bank deposit, and it is not insured\nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government agency, BFA\nor any of BFA\u2019s affiliates. Additional\nInformation About the Fund's Risks Each Fund\nis subject to various risks, any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV, trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each Fund discloses\nits portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The principal\nand other (non-principal) risks that apply to\nthe Fund are described below. A Fund that\ninvests in an Underlying Fund also may be\nindirectly exposed to these risks through such\ninvestment. Principal Risks Accelerated Return\nRisk. There can be no guarantee that the Fund\nwill be successful in its strategy to provide\napproximately twice the positive share price\nreturn, if any, of the Underlying Fund over an\nOutcome Period, subject to an Approximate Cap.\nIf an investor purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of an Outcome Period or does not\nstay invested in the Fund for the entirety of\nthe Outcome Period, the returns realized by\nthe investor may not match those that the Fund\nseeks to achieve. Approximate Cap Risk . The\nFund\u2019s strategy seeks to provide returns that\nare subject to an Approximate Cap, whose level\ndepends on prevailing market conditions ( e.g\n., volatility, interest rates, dividends, and\nother factors) at the time that the\nApproximate Cap is set. The Approximate Cap\nmay rise or fall from one Outcome Period to\nthe next, sometimes to a significant extent,\nand is unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Outcome Periods. If the Underlying\nFund experiences gains in excess of the\nApproximate Cap for an Outcome Period, the\nFund will not participate in any gains beyond\nthe Approximate Cap and will underperform the\nUnderlying Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be\nsignificantly below the Approximate Cap. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\na Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to indexes that track, or assets\nthat represent, other countries or geographic\nunits, industries, markets, market segments,\nor asset classes. Various types of securities,\nother assets and indexes may experience cycles\nof outperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk. From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party investor, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser, or\nanother fund may invest in a Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\n\n1\n\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater settlement and\noperational complexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized Participants, which may\nlimit the number of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Clearing Member\nDefault Risk. Transactions in some types of\nderivatives, including FLEX Options and\nfutures, are required to be centrally cleared\n( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ). In a transaction\ninvolving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house, such as the\nOCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the\nFund is not a member of clearing houses and\nonly members of a clearing house ( \u201c clearing\nmembers \u201d ) can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund will hold cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives positions, the\nFund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through their accounts at\nclearing members. Customer funds held at a\nclearing organization in connection with any\noptions contracts are held in a commingled\nomnibus account and are not identified to the\nname of the clearing member\u2019s individual\ncustomers. As a result, assets deposited by\nthe Fund with any clearing member as margin\nfor FLEX Options or futures may, in certain\ncircumstances, be used to satisfy losses of\nother clients of the Fund\u2019s clearing member.\nIn addition, although clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u2019\nobligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's\nor the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there\nis a risk that the assets of the Fund might\nnot be fully protected in the event of the\nclearing member\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund\nwould be limited to recovering only a pro rata\nshare of all available funds segregated on\nbehalf of the clearing member\u2019s customers for\nthe relevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund may be susceptible\nto an increased risk of loss, including losses\ndue to adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be more adversely\naffected by the underperformance of those\nassets, may experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more susceptible to\nadverse economic, market, political or\nregulatory impacts on those assets compared to\na fund that does not concentrate its\ninvestments. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives\nare subject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the\noptions held by the Fund. As a result, the\nability of the Fund to meet its objective\ndepends on the OCC being able to meet its\nobligations. In the unlikely event that the\nOCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable\nto meet its clearing and settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk. A Fund and\nentities that interact with the Fund are\nsusceptible to operational, information\nsecurity and related cybersecurity risks, both\ndirectly and through their service providers.\nThese entities include, but are not limited\nto, the Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor, other\nservice providers ( e.g ., index and benchmark\nproviders, accountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators), counterparties,\nmarket makers, Authorized Participants,\nlisting exchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental authorities.\nCybersecurity risks are also present for\nissuers of securities or other assets in which\na Fund invests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Derivatives Risk. A\nFund\u2019s use of derivatives ( e.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps, options) may be riskier than\nother types of investments and may not have\nthe intended effect on a Fund\u2019s performance.\nDerivatives can be sensitive to changes in\neconomic and market conditions, and they may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s volatility. A Fund also may\nexperience reduced returns as a result of\ntransaction costs and losses on derivatives\npositions. There is the risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between the value of a derivative\nand that of the asset underlying the\nderivative. Derivatives may create investment\nleverage, which could result in losses that\nsignificantly exceed a Fund\u2019s original\ninvestment. Due to their complexity,\nderivatives are subject to the risk of\nmispricing or improper valuation. The possible\nlack of a liquid secondary market for 2\nderivatives and the resulting inability of a\nFund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives\nposition could expose a Fund to losses and\ncould make derivatives more difficult for a\nFund to value accurately. Certain derivatives\nare subject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill not fulfill its contractual obligations.\nCertain derivatives are synthetic instruments\nthat attempt to replicate the performance of\ncertain reference assets. With regard to such\nderivatives, a Fund does not have a claim on\nthe reference assets and is subject to\nenhanced counterparty risk. Regulatory\nrequirements may delay or restrict a Fund\u2019s\nexercise of remedies if a derivative\ncounterparty were to default, which could\nadversely impact the Fund. The use of\nderivatives exposes a Fund to operational\nrisks, such as documentation and settlement\nissues, systems failures, inadequate controls\nand human error. Derivatives also involve\nlegal risks, including insufficient\ndocumentation, insufficient capacity or\nauthority of a counterparty, and the legality\nand enforceability of a contract. Derivatives\nexpose a Fund to derivative liquidity risks\nrelating to potential liquidity demands for a\nFund to make margin, collateral, or settlement\npayments. Equity Securities Risk. Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value due\nto general market or economic conditions,\nperceptions about the markets in which issuers\nparticipate or a number of factors relating to\na specific issuer. Investments in equity\nsecurities may be more volatile than\ninvestments in other asset classes. Equity\nsecurities (both common and preferred stock)\nare subordinated to debt securities in a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure, and so equity\nholders are generally subject to more risks,\nparticularly in the event of an issuer\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Common stock has the lowest\npriority and the greatest risks, including\nwith respect to dividends and any liquidation\npayments. Futures Contract Risk. Futures are\nstandardized, exchange-traded contracts that\nobligate a purchaser to take delivery, and a\nseller to make delivery, of a specific amount\nof an asset at a specified future date at a\nspecified price. Unlike equities, which\ntypically entitle the holder to a continuing\nownership stake in an issuer, futures\ncontracts normally specify a certain date for\nsettlement in cash based on the level of the\nreference rate. The primary risks associated\nwith the use of futures contracts are: (i) the\nimperfect correlation between the change in\nmarket value of the instruments held by the\nFund and the price of the futures contract;\n(ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary\nmarket for a futures contract and the\nresulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA's inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations.\nInvestment in Underlying Fund Risk. For a Fund\nthat invests in an Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance and risks are likely to\nbe directly related to those of the Underlying\nFund. A Fund\u2019s NAV will change with changes in\nthe value of an Underlying Fund and other\nassets that the Fund holds. The shares of an\nUnderlying Fund may trade at a premium or\ndiscount to the Underlying Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors in a Fund that invests in an\nUnderlying Fund will indirectly bear the\nexpenses charged by the Underlying Fund, and\nan investment in the Fund may entail more\nexpenses than a direct investment in the\nUnderlying Fund (except to the extent that\ncertain fees are waived by BFA). An investor\nin such a Fund may receive taxable gains from\nportfolio transactions by an Underlying Fund,\nas well as taxable gains from transactions in\nthe shares of an Underlying Fund that are held\nby the Fund. Issuer Risk. The performance of a\nFund depends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform differently\nfrom the market as a whole, due to changes in\nthe financial condition or credit rating of\nthe issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. 3 Management Risk. A\nFund that is actively managed or that has an\noutcome strategy is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment process, techniques, models\nand/or and risk analyses in making investment\ndecisions for the Fund will not produce the\ndesired results. The securities or other\nassets selected by BFA may result in returns\nthat are inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective, and the Fund may\nunderperform the market or any relevant\nbenchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing such a Fund and may\nalso adversely affect the ability of the Fund\nto achieve its investment objective. Market\nRisk. A Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. The value of a financial\ninstrument or other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market conditions, economic\ntrends or events that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular instrument or asset,\nor factors that affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on a Fund and its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or discounts to a\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and economic\nconditions generally do not have the same\nimpact on all types of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces numerous\nmarket trading risks, any of which may lead to\nits shares trading in the secondary market at\na premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Absence of an Active Primary Market.\nAlthough Fund shares are listed for trading on\none or more stock exchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary trading\nmarket for Fund shares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Secondary Listing Risks. A\nFund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded on U.S.\nand non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nU.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s primary\nlisting is maintained. Fund shares also may be\navailable to non-U.S. investors through funds\nor structured investment vehicles similar to\ndepositary receipts. There can be no assurance\nthat a Fund\u2019s shares will continue to trade on\nany such stock exchange or in any market or\nthat a Fund\u2019s shares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing or market\ntrading. A Fund\u2019s shares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the execution and\nsettlement risks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker direct their\ntrades for execution. Certain information that\nis available to investors who trade Fund\nshares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be available to\ninvestors who trade in other markets, which\nmay result in secondary market prices in such\nmarkets being less efficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund may trade in\nthe secondary market at times when the Fund\ndoes not accept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may trade in the\nsecondary market with more significant\npremiums or discounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the Fund accepts\ncreation and redemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in markets that\nclose at a different time than an exchange on\nwhich Fund shares are traded. Liquidity in\nthose securities may be reduced after the\napplicable closing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is open but after\nthe applicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to 4\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Non-Diversification Risk. A\nFund that is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nmay invest a greater percentage of its assets\nin securities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified. \u201d A non-\ndiversified Fund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with these particular\nissuers or counterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have a greater\nimpact on a non-diversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the performance of a\ndiversified Fund, and a non-diversified Fund\u2019s\nNAV may be more volatile. Operational Risk.\nEach Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. Each Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Options Risk .\nInvestments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother reference asset related to the option\ndecreased, remained the same or failed to\nincrease to a level at or beyond the exercise\nprice (in the case of a call option) or\nincreased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). When the\nFund sells an option, it may experience a\nsubstantial loss if the price of the\nunderlying security or other reference asset\nincreased to a level significantly above the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor decreased to a level significantly below\nthe exercise price (in the case of a put\noption). If a put or call option purchased by\nthe Fund were permitted to expire without\nbeing sold or exercised, its premium would\nrepresent a loss to the Fund. FLEX Options\nRisk. FLEX Options are subject to the risk\nthat they may be less liquid than certain\nother securities, such as standardized\noptions. In less liquid markets for the FLEX\nOptions, terminating FLEX Options may require\nthe payment of a premium or acceptance of a\ndiscounted price and may take longer to\ncomplete. In a less liquid market for FLEX\nOptions, the liquidation of a large number of\noptions may significantly impact the price of\nthe options and may adversely impact the value\nof an investment in the Fund. There is also a\nrisk that the Fund will be unable to maintain\nthe proportional relationship based on the\nnumber of exchange-traded options in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio or that adverse tax law\nchanges will negatively impact the treatment\nof FLEX Options. Additionally, to the extent\nmarket participants are not willing or able to\nenter into FLEX Option transactions with the\nFund at prices that reflect the market price\nof Fund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and the share\nprice of the Fund could be negatively\nimpacted. Outcome Period Risk . The\nApproximate Cap for an Outcome Period applies\nto Fund shares held over the entire Outcome\nPeriod. If an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter an Outcome Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of an Outcome Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nRisk of Investing in the U.S. Investing in\nU.S. issuers involves legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the U.S. A decrease\nin imports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations, inflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or political turmoil,\namong other risks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the securities listed\non U.S. exchanges. The U.S. is also subject to\nthe risk of natural disasters, such as\ndroughts, earthquakes, fires and floods. U.S.\nsecurity risks include acts of terrorism,\ninternal unrest and a deterioration in\nrelations between the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may adversely affect\nthe U.S. economy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies project that\nthe U.S. will maintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable future. Although\nelevated debt levels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic problems, the costs\nof servicing such debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances could arise\nthat could prevent the timely payment of\ninterest or principal on U.S. government debt,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences for the U.S.\neconomy and the global financial system. Small\nFund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In addition, a Fund may\nface the risk of being delisted if it does not\nmeet certain requirements set by the listing\nexchange. If a Fund were required to delist\nfrom the listing exchange, the Fund\u2019s value\nmay rapidly decline and its performance may be\nnegatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation\nof the Fund could lead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. 5 Tax Risk.\nThe Fund intends to elect and to qualify each\nyear to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code. As a RIC, the\nFund will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on the portion of its net\ninvestment income and net capital gains that\nit distributes to shareholders, provided that\nit satisfies certain requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code. However, the federal\nincome tax treatment of certain aspects of the\nFund\u2019s operations are not entirely clear. This\nincludes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s options\nstrategy, its hedging strategy, the\napplication of the \u201c straddle \u201d rules, and\nvarious loss limitation provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code. To qualify and maintain\nits status as a RIC, the Fund must meet\ncertain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. There\nis no published IRS guidance or case law on\nhow to determine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nTherefore, there is a risk that the Fund will\nnot meet the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s\ndiversification requirements and will not\nqualify, or will be disqualified, as a RIC.\nThe Fund intends to treat the reference asset\n( i.e ., the Underlying Fund) as the issuer of\nthe options. Assuming the reference asset\nqualifies as a RIC, the Fund could count the\noptions as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s\ndiversification requirements. In addition, the\nFund intends to treat any income it may derive\nfrom the options as \u201c qualifying income \u201d\nunder the provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode applicable to RICs. If the income is not\nqualifying income or if the options are not\ntreated as issued by the reference asset for\ndiversification test purposes, there is a risk\nthat the Fund could lose its RIC status. If\nthe Fund did not qualify as a RIC for any\ntaxable year and certain relief provisions\nwere not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwould be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. In such event, in\norder to re-qualify for taxation as a RIC, the\nFund might be required to recognize unrealized\ngains, pay substantial taxes and interest and\nmake certain distributions. This would cause\ninvestors to incur higher tax liabilities than\nthey otherwise would have incurred and would\nhave a negative impact on Fund returns. In\nsuch event, the Fund may reorganize, close or\nmaterially change its investment objective and\nstrategies. The Fund\u2019s investments in\noffsetting positions with respect to the\nUnderlying Fund may affect the character of\ngains or losses realized by the Fund under the\nInternal Revenue Code\u2019s \u201c straddle \u201d rules and\nmay increase the amount of short-term capital\ngains realized by the Fund. Such short-term\ncapital gains are taxed as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to U.S. shareholders in a\nnon-liquidating distribution. As a result, if\nthe Fund makes a non-liquidating distribution\nof short-term capital gains, the amount that\nU.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be substantially greater than for\nshareholders of a fund that does not engage in\nsuch transactions. Accordingly, shareholders\ncould have a lower after-tax return from\ninvesting in the Fund than investing directly\nin the Underlying Fund. The options included\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio are exchange-traded\noptions. The tax treatment of certain\nderivatives contracts, including listed non-\nequity options written or purchased by the\nFund on U.S. exchanges (such as options on\nfutures contracts, broad-based equity indices\nand debt securities), may be governed by\nSection 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code ( \u201c\nSection 1256 Contracts \u201d ). Section 1256\nContracts are treated as if they were sold (\ni.e ., \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at the end of\neach year. Gain or loss is recognized on this\ndeemed sale. Such treatment could cause the\nFund to recognize taxable income without\nreceiving cash. In order to maintain its RIC\nqualification, the Fund must distribute at\nleast 90% of its income annually. If options\nheld by the Fund were deemed to be Section\n1256 Contracts, and if the Fund were unable to\ndistribute marked-to-market gains to its\nshareholders, the Fund may lose its RIC\nqualification and be taxed as a regular\ncorporation. BFA believes that the options\ntypically held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio (i.e .,\noptions that reference the Underlying Fund)\nwill not be subject to Section 1256 but rather\nwill be subject to the straddle rules, and\nthat the disposition of such options will\nlikely result in short-term capital gains or\nlosses. Additionally, buying securities\nshortly before the record date for a taxable\ndividend or capital gains distribution is\ncommonly known as \u201c buying a dividend. \u201d If a\nshareholder purchases Fund shares after the\nOutcome Period has begun and shortly\nthereafter the Fund issues a dividend, the\nentire distribution may be taxable to the\nshareholder even though a portion of the\ndistribution effectively represents a return\nof the purchase price. Technology Companies\nRisk. Technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances may\nhave limited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Valuation Risk. The\nprice that a Fund could receive upon the sale\n(or other disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by a Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index (if\napplicable). Because non-U.S. exchanges or\nmarkets may be open on days or during time\nperiods when a Fund does not price its shares,\nthe value of the securities or other assets in\na Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on days or\nduring time periods when investors are not\nable to purchase or sell Fund shares. In\naddition, for purposes of calculating a Fund\u2019s\nNAV, the value of assets denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies (if any) is translated\ninto U.S. dollars at the prevailing market\nrates. For a Fund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex, this may result in a difference between\nthe prices used to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the Underlying Index,\nwhich, in turn, could result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of the Underlying Index.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when a Fund 6 is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Other Risks The order of the below\nrisk factors does not indicate the\nsignificance of any particular risk factor.\nClose-Out Risk for Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require counterparties\nthat are part of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking organizations\nto include contractual restrictions on close-\nout and cross-default in agreements relating\nto qualified financial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include agreements\nrelating to swaps, currency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase agreements\nand securities lending agreements. The\nrestrictions prevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract during a\nspecified time period if the counterparty is\nsubject to resolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising default rights\ndue to a receivership or similar proceeding of\nan affiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Communication Services\nSector Risk. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Consumer Goods and Services Companies\nRisk. Many consumer goods and services\ncompanies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d ) rely\nheavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending and may be impacted by\nsocial trends, marketing campaigns,\ndemographic shifts and other factors affecting\nconsumer preferences and demand. In addition,\ndamage to a brand or a reputation crisis can\nhave a substantial adverse impact on consumer\ncompanies. Certain consumer companies, such as\nthose providing discretionary goods or\nservices, may depend more on business cycles,\noverall economic conditions and consumer\nconfidence. Many consumer goods and services\nare subject to government regulation and the\nrelated compliance costs, and consumer\ncompanies also face the risk of product\nliability claims. Consumer companies also may\nbe adversely affected by volatility in\ncommodity prices, supply chain disruptions and\nlabor shortages. 7 Financial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-taking by\nfinancial companies may result in greater\noverall risk in the global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an unusually high\ndegree of volatility in financial markets and\npose the risk of large losses for financial\nservices companies. Financial companies\nfrequently operate with substantial financial\nleverage and are exposed directly to the\ncredit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nAn investment may be illiquid due to, among\nother things, fewer participants or less\ncapacity to make a market in the investment,\nthe lack of an active market for the\ninvestment, capital controls, delays or limits\non repatriation of local currency, and the\ninsolvency of local governments. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities or other\nassets with substantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have increased\nexposure to the risks associated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments may be\nharder to value, especially in changing\nmarkets. Liquid investments may become\nilliquid after purchase by a Fund,\nparticularly during periods of market turmoil.\nThere can be no assurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be liquid when\npurchased will continue to be liquid for as\nlong as it is held by a Fund, and any security\nor other asset held by a Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk management program. Holdings of\nilliquid investments may reduce a Fund\u2019s\nreturns because the Fund may be unable to\ntransact at advantageous times or prices. If a\nFund is forced to sell underlying investments\nat reduced prices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.\nThis may be magnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be greater than\nnormal. If other market participants attempt\nto liquidate holdings at the same time as a\nFund, this will lead to an increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater illiquid\ninvestments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, the Fund will need to sell\nliquid securities to meet redemption requests,\nand illiquid securities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nat a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected 8\n\nby the relevant threshold limits, and such\nlimitations may have adverse effects on the\nliquidity and performance of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. To the extent a Fund\ntracks an index, such limits may increase the\nrisk of the Fund being underinvested in an\nasset relative to its Underlying Index and\nincrease the risk of tracking error. For\nexample, ownership limits may apply to\nsecurities whose issuers operate in certain\nregulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A description\nof the policies and procedures with respect to\nthe disclosure of the Funds\u2019 portfolio\nsecurities and other assets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable Statement of\nAdditional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. Fact sheets providing\ninformation about each Fund\u2019s top holdings are\nposted on www.iShares.com when available and\nmay be requested by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737). Management of the Fund\nInvestment Adviser As investment adviser, BFA\nhas overall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Funds.\nBFA provides an investment program for the\nFunds and manages the investment of the Funds\u2019\nassets. In seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates\nprovided investment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.5 trillion. From\ntime to time, an employee of BlackRock may\nexpress views regarding a particular security\nor other instrument, asset class, company,\nindustry, or market sector. Such views are the\nviews of only that individual as of the time\nexpressed. They do not necessarily represent\nthe views of BlackRock or any other person\nwithin the BlackRock organization. Such views\nmay change at any time based upon market or\nother conditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, except the management fees, interest\nexpenses, taxes, expenses incurred with\nrespect to the acquisition and disposition of\nportfolio securities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or expenses,\nand litigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (as determined by a majority of the\nTrustees who are not \u201c interested persons \u201d of\nthe Trust). Operating expenses paid by BFA\nunder the Investment Advisory Agreement\nexclude Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany. A discussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Board of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA will be available\nin the Fund's Form N-CSR filed with the SEC\nfor the period ending January 31, 2025 and in\nthe applicable financial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee from the Fund, as a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, net of any\napplicable waivers, at the annual rate set\nforth in the table below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees for a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to its\nexpiration date only upon written agreement of\nthe Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from\ntime to time voluntarily waive and/or\nreimburse fees or expenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s\ntotal annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Large Cap           0.50%1          \n  Accelerated Outcome ETF                     \n                                              \n1 BFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees in an amount\nequal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to investments by the\nFund in other funds advised by BFA or its\naffiliates, through November 30, 2030. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2030 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. Portfolio Managers The\nPortfolio Managers for the Fund are\nresponsible for various functions related to\nportfolio management, including, but not\nlimited to, investing cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of their respective\nportfolio management teams to focus on certain\nasset classes,\n\n9\n\nimplementing investment strategy, researching\nand reviewing investment strategy and\noverseeing members of their respective teams\nwho have more limited responsibilities.\nMatthew DeCicco and Orlando Montalvo are\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Matthew DeCicco has\nbeen employed by BFA or its affiliates as a\nportfolio manager since 2010. He is a Director\nof BlackRock, Inc. Orlando Montalvo has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates as a senior\nportfolio manager since 2009. He is a Managing\nDirector of BlackRock, Inc. Each Fund\u2019s SAI\nprovides additional information about the\nPortfolio Managers\u2019 compensation, other\naccounts managed by the Portfolio Managers and\nthe Portfolio Managers\u2019 ownership (if any) of\nshares of the Funds. Administrator, Custodian\nand Transfer Agent The administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for the Fund is\nindicated in the table below.\n                                              \n          The                        State    \n  Fund    Bank     Citiba\u2026  JPMorg\u2026  Street\u2026  \n          ofNew    N.A.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions.\n\n10\n\nUnder a securities lending program approved by\nthe Board, the Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as their securities\nlending agent to the extent that they\nparticipate in the securities lending program.\nFor these services, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received as collateral\nfor the loaned securities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the entities to\nwhich a Fund may lend its portfolio securities\nunder the securities lending program. Under an\nETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its Affiliates. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates may benefit from a Fund using a\nBlackRock index by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindexes. BlackRock and its Affiliates are not\nobligated to license an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to use a\nBlackRock index. The terms of a Fund\u2019s index\nlicensing agreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as favorable as the\nterms offered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. Shareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder information, including\nhow to buy and sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by calling toll-free\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and Selling Shares\nTransactions in shares of the Funds occur in\nthe primary market and the secondary market.\nPrimary market transactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only\nbetween the Funds and Authorized Participants\n( i.e ., financial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in the Creations\nand Redemptions section below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national securities exchanges,\nwhere they can be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices, like shares\nof other publicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on non-U.S.\nexchanges and through funds or structured\ninvestment vehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose any minimum\ninvestment for Fund shares purchased on an\nexchange or otherwise in the secondary market.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market generally involves\ntwo types of costs that are common in\nsecurities transactions. First, when buying or\nselling Fund shares through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and other\ncharges. The commission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant proportional\ncost if you are seeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is any\ndifference between the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread varies over\ntime based on a Fund\u2019s trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Generally, the spread is\nsmaller if a Fund has high trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and larger if a Fund has\nlower trading volume and market liquidity. The\nlatter is often the case for newly launched or\nsmaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or other assets held\nby the Fund, particularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances of\nsignificant volatility of the underlying\nassets. The U.S. national securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open for trading\nMonday through Friday and are closed on\nweekends and the following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas Day. Investments in Investment\nCompanies Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and unregistered\ninvestment companies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For example, a\nregistered investment company (the \u201c Acquired\nFund \u201d ), such as the Funds, may not knowingly\nsell or otherwise dispose of any security\nissued by the Acquired Fund to any investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale\nor disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company\nor companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 11 12d1-4 and invest\nin the Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1)\nlimits. Any investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Acquiring Funds must adhere to the\nSection 12(d)(1) limits when investing in the\nFund, which invests in one or more Underlying\nFunds. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. Investors owning Fund shares are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value The NAV of a\nFund normally is determined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, on each day that the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is determined as of\nthe close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based on\nprices at the time of closing. Any Fund assets\nor liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\n12 When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or liability is\nthinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\nDividends and Distributions General Policies.\nA Fund generally declares and pays dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, at least\nonce a year. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for a Fund. The Trust reserves the right\nto declare special distributions if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses 13 (capital gain\ndividends) are taxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how long you have\nheld the Fund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital\ngains and qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation at\npreferential rates for non-corporate\nshareholders. However, different preferential\nrates may apply depending on the type of\ncapital gains, such as Fund distributions of\ncertain amounts received from real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), if any.\nReturn of Capital. If a Fund\u2019s distributions\nexceed current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of capital to\nshareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthose shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. Once a shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as capital\ngains, if the shareholder holds shares of the\nFund as capital assets. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\nGenerally, qualified dividend income includes\ndividend income from stock issued by taxable\nU.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.\ncorporations, provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements and has\nnot hedged its position in the stock in\ncertain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond, including a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Treatment of\nOptions. A Fund\u2019s investments in offsetting\npositions with respect to an Underlying Fund\nmay be \u201c straddles \u201d ( i.e. , offsetting\npositions with respect to personal property)\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. The\nstraddle rules may affect the character of\ngains (or losses) realized by a Fund, and\nlosses realized by a Fund on positions that\nare part of a straddle may be deferred under\nthe straddle rules, rather than being taken\ninto account in calculating taxable income for\nthe taxable year in which the losses are\nrealized. In addition, certain 14 carrying\ncharges (including interest expense)\nassociated with positions in a straddle may be\nrequired to be capitalized rather than\ndeducted currently. Certain elections that a\nFund may make with respect to its straddle\npositions may also affect the amount,\ncharacter and timing of the recognition of\ngains or losses from the affected positions.\nThe tax consequences of straddle transactions\nto a Fund are not entirely clear in all\nsituations under currently available\nauthority. The straddle rules may increase the\namount of short-term capital gains realized by\na Fund, which are taxed as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to U.S. shareholders in a\nnon-liquidating distribution. Because the\napplication of the straddle rules may affect\nthe character of gains or losses, defer losses\nand/or accelerate the recognition of gains or\nlosses from the affected straddle positions,\nif a Fund makes a non-liquidating distribution\nof its short-term capital gains, the amount\nthat U.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be substantially greater or less as\ncompared to a fund that did not engage in such\ntransactions. Under Section 1256 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, certain types of\nexchange-traded options are treated as if they\nwere sold ( i.e. , \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at\nthe end of each year. The Fund does not\nbelieve that the positions held by the Fund\nwill be subject to Section 1256, which means\nthat the positions will not be marked to\nmarket, but the positions will be subject to\nthe straddle rules. Non-U.S. Income Taxes\nDividends, interest and capital gains (if any)\nearned by a Fund with respect to securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and other taxes\nimposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the U.S. may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. If, at the\nclose of a year, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of non-U.S. stocks or\nsecurities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof shares of an Underlying Fund, the Fund may\n\u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain non-U.S.\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its assets meet these\nrequirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be subject to a\n30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a\nlower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S. and you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or social\nsecurity number and made other required\ncertifications, by law, backup withholding at\na 24% rate will apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities Lending If\nyour shares of a Fund are loaned out pursuant\nto a securities lending arrangement, you may\nlose the ability to treat Fund dividends that\nare paid while the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend income, and you\nmay lose the ability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To\nthe extent such Fund is expected to invest in\nan Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Underlying Fund, if any, will not offset\nnet capital gains of the Fund. 15\n\nTaxes on the Sale of Exchange-Listed Fund\nShares Any capital gain or loss realized upon\na sale of Fund shares is generally treated as\na long-term capital gain or loss if the shares\nhave been held for more than one year. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares that have been held for one year\nor less is generally treated as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss. However, any capital\nloss on a sale of Fund shares held for six\nmonths or less is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such\nshares. Any such capital gains, including from\nsales of Fund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax mentioned above. The\nforegoing discussion summarizes some of the\nconsequences under current U.S. federal tax\nlaw of an investment in a Fund. It is not a\nsubstitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of shares.\nConsult your personal tax advisor about the\npotential tax consequences of an investment in\nshares of a Fund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Creations and Redemptions Prior to being\ntraded in the secondary market, Fund shares\nare \u201c created \u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market makers, large\ninvestors and other financial institutions) in\nblock-size Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created or redeemed\nonly in Creation Units, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. In-Kind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant deposits into a Fund\na \u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. All Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund an amount of cash\nspecified by the Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap                                   \n  Accelerat\u2026           \u2713                      \n  Outcome                                     \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or\n\n16\n\nincreased transaction costs. Further, the vast\nmajority of trading in Fund shares occurs on\nthe secondary market, which does not involve\nthe Funds directly, and such trading is\nunlikely to cause many of the harmful effects\nof frequent cash purchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. To the extent a Fund engages in\nin-kind transactions, the Fund intends to\ncomply with the U.S. federal securities laws\nin accepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses\nto exchange members, the prospectus delivery\nmechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\na national securities exchange. Householding\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Funds on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds available to\ntheir customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the Funds. Payments\nof this type are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds over another investment.\nMore information regarding these payments is\ncontained in the applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments that their firm may receive\nfrom BFA or its affiliates.

Fund\nThe Trust currently consists of more than 345\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. On April 17, 2025,\nthe name of the Fund changed from the iShares\nLarge Cap Accelerated ETF to the iShares Large\nCap Accelerated Outcome ETF. The Fund seeks to\nprovide approximately twice the positive share\nprice return of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n(the \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d ), up to an\napproximate upside limit, while seeking to\napproximately track the negative share price\nreturn of the Underlying Fund, over each full\ncalendar quarter. BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) serves as investment adviser to the\nFund, and BFA or its affiliates serves as\ninvestment adviser to the Underlying Fund. The\nFund offers and issues shares at its net asset\nvalue per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\n(the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d or \u201c Creation\nBasket \u201d ), together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment (the \u201c Cash Component \u201d\n). Shares of the Fund are listed for trading\non Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c Cboe BZX \u201d ) (\nthe \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ), a national\nsecurities exchange. Shares of the Fund are\ntraded in the secondary market and elsewhere\nat market prices that may be at, above or\nbelow the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable\nonly in Creation Units and, generally, in\nexchange for portfolio securities and a Cash\nAmount (as defined in the Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI). Creation\nUnits typically are a specified number of\nshares, generally 40,000 or multiples thereof.\nThe Trust reserves the right to permit or\nrequire that creations and redemptions of\nshares are effected fully or partially in cash\nand reserves the right to permit or require\nthe substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu\nof cash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of any Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks of the Fund The Fund\nseeks to provide certain pre-determined\noutcomes (the \u201c Outcomes \u201d ) based on the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund for\ninvestors who hold Fund shares over a full\ncalendar quarter (the \u201c Outcome Period \u201d ).\nThe Outcomes sought by the Fund are: \u2022\nApproximately twice the share price return of\nthe Underlying Fund (the \u201c Accelerated Return\n\u201d ), up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), and \u2022 Downside\nperformance that approximately tracks, one for\none, the negative share price return of the\nUnderlying Fund. The Outcomes are intended to\nbe realized only by investors who hold Fund\nshares at the outset of the Outcome Period and\ncontinue to hold the shares through the end of\nthe Outcome Period. Specifically, in order to\nhold Fund shares for the entirety of an\nOutcome Period, an investor must buy or\ncontinue holding shares at the close on the\nlast trading day of the prior Outcome Period\nand sell or continue holding the shares at the\nclose on the last trading day of the current\nOutcome Period. If investors buy Fund shares\nafter the start of the Outcome Period or sell\nFund shares before the Outcome Period\nconcludes, they may experience returns that\ndiffer significantly from the Outcomes. These\ninclude experiencing little or no gains\nrelated to the Accelerated Return or the\nUnderlying Fund and losses that are greater\nthan the Underlying Fund\u2019s losses. The Fund\nwill be offered indefinitely and is not\nintended to terminate after one or more\nOutcome Periods. The Fund has characteristics\nunlike many traditional products and may not\nbe appropriate for all investors. The Outcomes\nmay not be achieved, and investors may lose\nsome or all of their money. The Fund does not\nprovide a buffer, floor or other protection\nagainst losses. The Current Outcome Period For\nthe current Outcome Period of April 1, 2025\nthrough June 30, 2025, the Approximate Cap is\n7.58%, before taking into account any fees or\nexpenses charged to, or transaction costs\nincurred by, the Fund or the Underlying Fund.\nWhen the Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of\n0.50% of its average daily net assets is taken\ninto account, the Approximate Cap for the\ncurrent Outcome Period is reduced to 7.46%.\nThe returns that the Fund seeks to provide do\nnot take into account the costs associated\nwith buying shares of the Underlying Fund and\nany other expenses incurred by the Fund.\nPlease visit the Fund\u2019s page on\nwww.iShares.com for more information about the\npotential outcomes of an investment in the\nFund during the current Outcome Period,\nincluding the remaining Approximate Cap. The\nUnderlying Fund The Underlying Fund is the\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (Ticker: IVV). It is\nan ETF that seeks to track the investment\nresults of the S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying\nFund\u2019s Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of the large-capitalization sector\nof the U.S. equity market, as determined by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC. The securities in\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s Index represent a broad\nrange of industries and are weighted based on\nthe float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The components of the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index are likely to change\nover time. BFA is the investment adviser to\nthe Underlying Fund and receives a management\nfee from the Underlying Fund. BFA manages the\nUnderlying Fund using a \u201c representative\nsampling \u201d indexing strategy. This involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying Fund may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s performance to diverge from\nthat of the index and produce \u201c tracking\nerror. \u201d Tracking error risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\n\n2\n\nThe prospectus and other reports of the\nUnderlying Fund are available at www.sec.gov\nand www.iShares.com. Shares of the Underlying\nFund are listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. The Fund\u2019s\nUse of Options The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying Fund and customized\ncall options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying Fund. The\noptions in which the Fund transacts\n(typically, equity or index exchange-traded\noptions contracts) are referred to generally\nas Flexible Exchange Options ( \u201c FLEX Options\n\u201d ). The Fund may transact in other exchange-\ntraded options that reference the price\nperformance of the Underlying Fund, the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index or other ETFs that\ntrack the Underlying Fund\u2019s Index. An options\ncontract is an agreement between a buyer and\nseller that gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right but not the obligation to buy (in\nthe case of a call option) or sell (in the\ncase of a put option) a particular financial\ninstrument at a specified future date for an\nagreed-upon price, commonly known as the \u201c\nstrike price \u201d . When the Fund buys a call\noption, it pays a premium and receives the\nright, but not the obligation, to purchase\nshares of the Underlying Fund or other\nreference asset at a strike price by or on the\nexpiration date. If the Fund buys a put\noption, it pays a premium and receives the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell shares\nof the Underlying Fund or other reference\nasset at a strike price by or on the\nexpiration date. When the Fund writes (sells)\na call option, it receives a premium and gives\nthe purchaser of the option the right to\npurchase from the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying Fund or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date. If\nthe Fund writes (sells) a put option, it\nreceives a premium and gives the purchaser of\nthe option the right to sell to the Fund\nshares of the Underlying Fund or other\nreference asset at a strike price by or on\nexpiration date. FLEX Options provide the\nability to customize key option contract terms\nsuch as strike price, style and expiration\ndate. The options in which the Fund invests\nare European style, meaning they are\nexercisable at the strike price only on the\nexpiration date. The Fund typically trades\noptions that expire at or around the end of\neach Outcome Period. As an in-the-money option\nheld by the Fund approaches its expiration\ndate, its value typically will increasingly\nmove with the value of its reference asset,\nsuch as the Underlying Fund. However, the\nvalue of the options may change because of\nfactors other than the value of the reference\nasset, including interest rate changes,\ndividends, the actual and perceived volatility\nof the reference asset, the remaining time\nuntil the options expire, limitations\nestablished by options exchanges, and trading\nconditions in the options market, among\nothers. Due to these factors, the value of the\noptions typically does not increase or\ndecrease at the same rate as the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price on a day-to-day basis. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not increase or\ndecrease at the same rate as the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price. Options positions are\nmarked to market daily by the Fund. The value\nof the options traded by the Fund is\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nother recognized pricing methods. The options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\nThe options are guaranteed for settlement by\nthe Options Clearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d\n), a market clearinghouse that guarantees the\nperformance by counterparties to certain\nderivatives contracts. The OCC may make\nadjustments to FLEX Options for certain\nsignificant events. Outcomes Targeted by the\nFund For each Outcome Period, the Fund obtains\nexposure to the share price return of the\nUnderlying Fund by holding shares of the\nUnderlying Fund and futures that reference the\nprice performance of the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex. The Accelerated Return and Approximate\nCap are typically created by trading a set of\ncall options, as described below, at the close\nof the last trading day of the prior Outcome\nPeriod. Accelerated Return . The Fund creates\nthe Accelerated Return by buying a call option\nwith a strike price that is approximately at-\nthe-money relative to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshare price (the \u201c ATM Call \u201d ). This exposure\nto the Underlying Fund, combined with the\nFund\u2019s investment in shares of the Underlying\nFund and futures on the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex, creates the approximately double upside\nreturn. Approximate Cap . The Fund creates the\nApproximate Cap by selling a call option that\nis two times the notional value of the ATM\nCall and that has a higher, out-of-the-money\nstrike price relative to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshare price (the \u201c Cap Option \u201d ). The Cap\nOption\u2019s higher strike price prevents the Fund\nfrom realizing the benefit of any increase in\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s share price above that\nstrike price. The Approximate Cap for an\nOutcome Period is approximately twice the\nupside return implied by the strike price of\nthe Cap Option for that Outcome Period. The\nstrike price for the Cap Option depends on\n\n3\n\nthe market conditions when the option is sold\nand likely will be different for each Outcome\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Outcome Period. The Fund uses the\npremium collected from selling the Cap Option\nand the expected dividend distributions from\nthe Underlying Fund to cover the premium that\nit pays to buy the ATM Call. The Fund\u2019s\nAccelerated Return and Approximate Cap (net of\nthe management fee) for the current Outcome\nPeriod, along with the Fund\u2019s current position\nrelative to the Outcomes, are available and\nupdated daily on the Fund\u2019s page on\nwww.iShares.com. On the last trading day of\neach Outcome Period, the Fund will trade a new\nset of call options to create the Accelerated\nReturn and Approximate Cap for the next\nOutcome Period. After the close of business on\nthe last trading day of the Outcome Period,\nthe Fund will file a prospectus supplement\nthat discloses the Approximate Cap (gross and\nnet of its management fee) for the next\nOutcome Period. Outcome Period The Outcomes\nfor an Outcome Period apply only to Fund\nshares that are held over the entire Outcome\nPeriod. An investor who purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of an Outcome Period or\nwho sells Fund shares before the end of an\nOutcome Period may not fully realize the\nApproximate Cap for the Outcome Period and may\nexperience price returns that are different\nfrom the Outcomes. This is because, while the\nOutcomes are fixed levels that are calculated\nin relation to the Underlying Fund\u2019s price and\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of that Outcome\nPeriod and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Outcome Period, an investor who\ntransacts in Fund shares during the Outcome\nPeriod will likely do so at a price that is\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of\nthe Outcome Period. For example, if an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares during an\nOutcome Period at a time when the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price has increased from its\nprice at the beginning of the Outcome Period,\nthe investor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than\nthe Approximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses that exceed the losses of\nthe Underlying Fund for the remainder of the\nOutcome Period. Conversely, if an investor\npurchases Fund shares during an Outcome Period\nat a time when the Underlying Fund\u2019s share\nprice has decreased from its price at the\nbeginning of the Outcome Period, the Fund may\nrequire a larger increase in the Underlying\nFund\u2019s share price before it reaches the\nAccelerated Return. Fund and Underlying Fund\nPerformance If there are any inflows, or\ncreation transactions, for the Fund during an\nOutcome Period, the Fund typically will buy\nUnderlying Fund shares and futures on the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index and will seek to trade\nthe same set of call options as described\nabove. This will occur even in circumstances\nwhere the Fund would receive a negligible\npremium for selling an out-of-the-money call,\nwhich may give up more sizable returns to the\nextent that the option later becomes in the\nmoney. Because the Fund uses distributions\nfrom the Underlying Fund to purchase the ATM\nCall, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely to be\nless than the Underlying Fund\u2019s performance\nwhen (1) distributions are considered and (2)\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s performance is less than\nhalf of its distributions or is negative. The\nFund may also underperform the Underlying Fund\nif the returns of the Underlying Fund exceed\nthe Approximate Cap net of the distributions.\nThe Fund\u2019s market value and NAV may not\ncorrelate with the Underlying Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index. In periods of extreme\nmarket volatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be\nsubject to an upside limit significantly below\nthe Approximate Cap and a downside that is\nsignificantly greater than the price return of\nthe Underlying Fund. Investors may lose their\nentire investment, and an investment in the\nFund is appropriate only for investors willing\nto bear those losses. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying Fund, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying Fund shares and\nfutures on the Underlying Fund\u2019s Index for an\nOutcome Period, the Fund may instead do one or\nmore of the following, among other things: \u2022\npurchase one or more other ETFs that seek to\ntrack the Underlying Fund\u2019s Index; \u2022 purchase\nequity securities ( e.g ., component\nsecurities of the Underlying Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index) in seeking to track\nthe share price return of the Underlying Fund;\nor \u2022 invest in U.S. treasuries, money market\nfunds and/or other cash equivalents and\npurchase or sell a combination of call and put\noptions that seek to synthesize the economic\ncharacteristics of the Underlying Fund.\n\n4\n\nIf the Fund invests in equity securities\n(other than the Underlying Fund), the Fund\u2019s\nequity security investments will be primarily\nin the common stocks of companies held by the\nUnderlying Fund that BFA believes will provide\na risk/return profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying Fund. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of\nits net assets (plus any borrowings for\ninvestment purposes) in securities or other\ninstruments that provide exposure to\nsecurities of large-capitalization companies\nor that provide for the Accelerated Return or\nfor the Approximate Cap with respect to\nsecurities of large-capitalization companies.\nFor purposes of the Fund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c\nlarge-capitalization companies \u201d are those\nwithin the range of capitalization of the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Index. Additional\nInformation Regarding FLEX Options. FLEX\nOptions are customized option contracts\navailable through U.S. national securities\nexchanges that are guaranteed for settlement\nby the Options Clearing Corporation ( \u201c OCC \u201d\n). FLEX Options provide investors with the\nability to customize assets referenced by the\noptions, exercise prices, exercise styles and\nexpiration dates, while achieving price\ndiscovery in competitive, transparent auctions\nmarkets and avoiding the counterparty exposure\nof over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) options\npositions. Each option contract entitles the\nholder thereof to purchase (for the call\noptions) or sell (for the put options) shares\nof the reference asset at the strike price.\nThe FLEX Options held by the Fund are all\nEuropean-style options, which means that they\nare exercisable at a predetermined specified\nprice (the \u201c strike price \u201d ) only on the FLEX\nOption\u2019s expiration date. The OCC guarantees\nperformance by each of the counterparties to\nthe FLEX Options, becoming the \u201c buyer for\nevery seller and the seller for every buyer \u201d\n, reducing counterparty risk for clearing\nmembers and options traders. Although\nguaranteed for settlement by the OCC, FLEX\nOptions are still subject to counterparty risk\nwith the OCC and subject to the risk that the\nOCC may fail to perform the settlement of the\nFLEX Options due to bankruptcy or other\nadverse reasons. The Fund bears the risk that\nthe OCC will be unable or unwilling to perform\nits obligations under the FLEX Options\ncontracts. Subject to the determination by the\nSecurities Committee of the OCC, adjustments\nmay be made to the FLEX Options for certain\nevents specified in the OCC\u2019s by-laws and\nrules: certain stock dividends or\ndistributions, stock splits, reverse stock\nsplits, rights offerings, distributions,\nreorganizations, recapitalizations, or\nreclassifications with respect to an\nunderlying security, or a merger,\nconsolidation, dissolution or liquidation of\nthe issuer of the underlying security.\nAccording to the OCC\u2019s by-laws, the nature and\nextent of any such adjustment is to be\ndetermined by the OCC\u2019s Securities Committee,\nin light of the circumstances known to it at\nthe time such determination is made, based on\nits judgment as to what is appropriate for the\nprotection of investors and the public\ninterest, taking into account such factors as\nfairness to holders and writers (or purchasers\nand sellers) of the affected options, the\nmaintenance of a fair and orderly market in\nthe affected options, consistency of\ninterpretation and practice, efficiency of\nexercise settlement procedures, and the\ncoordination with other clearing agencies of\nthe clearance and settlement of transactions\nin the underlying interest. The reference\nasset for the FLEX Options in which the Fund\ninvests is the Underlying Fund, the iShares\nCore S&P 500 ETF. As such, the value of the\nFund\u2019s FLEX Options will fluctuate with\nchanges in the value of the securities held by\nthe Underlying Fund and its share price. In\naddition to the value of the reference asset,\nthe value of an option, in general, will\nreflect, among other things, the time\nremaining until expiration (the end of the\nOutcome Period), the relationship of the\nstrike price to the market price of the\nreference asset, and general market\nconditions. Options that expire unexercised\nhave no value. Each of the options exchanges\nhas established limitations governing the\nmaximum number of call or put options on the\nsame asset that may be bought or written by a\nsingle investor, whether acting alone or in\nconcert with others (regardless of whether\nsuch options are written on the same or\ndifferent exchanges or are held or written on\none or more accounts or through one or more\nbrokers). Under these limitations, option\npositions of all investment companies advised\nby BFA are combined for purposes of these\nlimits. Pursuant to these limitations, an\nexchange may order the liquidation of\npositions and may impose other sanctions or\nrestrictions. These position limits may\nrestrict the number of listed options that the\nFund may buy or sell. Options on a reference\nasset entitle the purchaser of the option the\nright to purchase (for a call option) or sell\n(for a put option) the reference asset at the\nstrike price. If a Fund sells a call, it\nreceives a premium and agrees that the\npurchaser of the call, upon exercise of the\ncall, will receive from the Fund the delivery\nof a specified number of shares of the\nreference asset in exchange for the strike\nprice. If a Fund buys a call, it pays a\npremium and has the same rights to such call\nas indicated above. If a Fund buys a put, it\npays a premium and has the right to require\nthe seller of the put, upon the Fund\u2019s\nexercise of the put, to deliver the specified\nnumber of shares of the reference asset in\nexchange for the strike price. If a Fund sells\na put, it\n\n5\n\nreceives a premium and the purchaser of the\nput has the right to require the Fund to\ndeliver the specified number of shares of the\nreference asset in exchange for the strike\nprice. Although the Fund will generally\nutilize FLEX Options that are physically\nsettled, the Fund may also utilize FLEX\nOptions that are cash-settled. Cash-settled\noptions give the holder the right to receive\nan amount (or owe an amount) of cash upon the\nexercise of the option. Gain or loss depends\non changes in the value of the reference\nasset\u2019s share price relative to the strike\nprice for a given option contract. The amount\nof cash is equal to the difference between the\nclosing price of the reference asset\u2019s share\nprice and the exercise price of the option\ncontract times a specified multiple ( \u201c\nmultiplier \u201d ), which determines the total\nvalue for each point of such difference.\nBorrowing. The Fund may borrow for temporary\nor emergency purposes, including to meet\npayments due from redemptions or to facilitate\nthe settlement of securities or other\ntransactions. The purchase of securities while\nborrowings are outstanding may have the effect\nof leveraging the Fund. The incurrence of\nleverage increases the Fund\u2019s exposure to\nrisk, and borrowed funds are subject to\ninterest costs that will reduce net income.\nPurchasing securities while borrowings are\noutstanding creates special risks, such as the\npotential for greater volatility in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the yield on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. In addition, the interest expenses\nfrom borrowings may exceed the income\ngenerated by the Fund\u2019s portfolio and,\ntherefore, the amount available (if any) for\ndistribution to shareholders as dividends may\nbe reduced. BFA may determine to maintain\noutstanding borrowings if it expects that the\nbenefits to the Fund\u2019s shareholders will\noutweigh the current reduced return. Certain\ntypes of borrowings by the Fund must be made\nfrom a bank or may result in the Fund being\nsubject to covenants in credit agreements\nrelating to asset coverage, portfolio\ncomposition requirements and other matters. It\nis not anticipated that observance of such\ncovenants would impede BFA\u2019s management of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Diversification\nStatus. The Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified fund is a\nfund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with\nregard to the percentage of its assets that\nmay be invested in the securities of a single\nissuer. The securities of a particular issuer\n(or securities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of a fund\u2019s investment portfolio.\nThis may adversely affect the fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject the fund\u2019s shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby more diversified investment companies. The\nFund intends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Equity Securities. Equity\nsecurities generally have greater price\nvolatility than fixed-income securities. The\nmarket price of equity securities may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nEquity securities may decline in value due to\nfactors affecting equity securities markets\ngenerally; particular industries, sectors or\ngeographic regions represented in those\nmarkets; or individual issuers. The types of\ndevelopments that may affect an issuer of an\nequity security include management\nperformance, financial leverage and reduced\ndemand for the issuer's goods or services.\nCommon and preferred stock represent equity or\nownership interests in an issuer. Preferred\nstock, however, pays dividends at a specified\nrate and has precedence over common stock in\nthe payment of dividends. In the event an\nissuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,\nthe claims of owners of bonds and preferred\nstock take precedence over the claims of those\nwho own common stock. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by the Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund to access its investable\nuniverse, simulate investments that would\notherwise be eligible, facilitate trading or\nto reduce transaction costs. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nThe Fund or the Underlying Fund will not use\nfutures, options on futures or securities\noptions for speculative purposes. The Fund and\nthe Underlying Fund intend to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to the Underlying Fund, has claimed an\n\n6\n\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFund or the Underlying Fund, is not subject to\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA. See the Regulation\nRegarding Derivatives section of this SAI for\nmore information. Futures contracts provide\nfor the future sale by one party and purchase\nby another party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund or the Underlying Fund may enter into\nfutures contracts to purchase securities\nindexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the\nunderlying securities and believes prices will\nrise before the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund will be required to\ndeposit with the broker an amount of cash or\ncash equivalents known as \u201c initial margin, \u201d\nwhich is similar to a performance bond or good\nfaith deposit on the contract and is returned\nto the Fund or the Underlying Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may\nelect to close the position by taking an\nopposite position, which will operate to\nterminate the Fund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's\nexisting position in the contract. An option\non a futures contract, as contrasted with a\ndirect investment in such a contract, gives\nthe purchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The\npotential for loss related to writing call\noptions is unlimited. The potential for loss\nrelated to writing put options is limited to\nthe agreed-upon price per share, also known as\nthe \u201c strike price, \u201d less the premium\nreceived from writing the put. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts that are\ntraded on an exchange as a hedge against\nchanges in value of their portfolio securities\nor in anticipation of the purchase of\nsecurities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to or dispose of\nsecurities that are otherwise eligible\ninvestments at favorable prices, to invest\ncash in a securities index that offers similar\nexposure to that being sought by the Fund or\notherwise to achieve the Fund's objective. A\ncall option gives a holder the right to\npurchase a specific security at a specified\nprice ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within a\nspecified period of time. A put option gives a\nholder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may\npurchase put options to hedge its portfolio\nagainst the risk of a decline in the market\nvalue of securities held and may purchase call\noptions to hedge against an increase in the\nprice of securities it is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may\nwrite put and call options along with a long\nposition in options to increase its ability to\nhedge against a change in the market value of\nthe securities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may\npurchase or sell securities options on a U.S.\nor non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC\nmarket through a transaction with a dealer.\nOptions on a securities index are typically\nsettled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). Investments in Underlying Fund.\nThe Underlying Fund is a type of investment\ncompany referred to as an exchange-traded fund\n( \u201c ETF \u201d ). The Underlying Fund is designed\nto track a particular index and is advised by\nBFA. Shares of the Underlying Fund are listed\nfor trading on national securities exchanges\nand trade throughout the day on those\nexchanges and other secondary markets. There\ncan be no assurance that the requirements of\nthe national securities exchanges necessary to\nmaintain the listing of shares of the\nUnderlying Fund will continue to be met. A\nnational securities exchange may, but is not\n\n7\n\nrequired to, remove the shares of the\nUnderlying Fund from listing if, among other\nthings: (i) following the initial 12-month\nperiod beginning upon the commencement of\ntrading of an Underlying Fund, there are fewer\nthan 50 record and/or beneficial holders of\nthe shares for 30 or more consecutive trading\ndays, (ii) the value of an Underlying Fund's\nunderlying index is no longer calculated or\navailable, or (iii) any other event shall\noccur or condition exist that, in the opinion\nof the national securities exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the national securities\nexchange inadvisable. A national securities\nexchange will remove the shares of an\nUnderlying Fund from listing and trading upon\ntermination of such Underlying Fund. Shares of\nthe Underlying Fund trade on exchanges at\nprices at, above or below their most recent\nNAV. The per share NAV of the Underlying Fund\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of such Underlying Fund's holdings since\nthe most recent calculation. The trading\nprices of the Underlying Fund's shares\nfluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan NAV. The trading prices of the Underlying\nFund's shares may deviate significantly from\nNAV during periods of market volatility. Any\nof these factors may lead to the Underlying\nFund's shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Underlying Fund's\nNAV due to timing reasons as well as market\nsupply and demand factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to the Underlying Fund's creations\nand redemptions or the existence of extreme\nmarket volatility may result in trading prices\nof Underlying Fund shares that differ\nsignificantly from NAV. If the Fund purchases\nshares of the Underlying Fund at a time when\nthe market price of the Underlying Fund's\nshares are at a premium to the NAV or sells at\na time when the market price of the Underlying\nFund is at a discount to the NAV, then the\nFund may sustain losses. As in the case of\nother publicly-traded securities, brokers'\ncommissions on buying or selling shares of the\nUnderlying Fund will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels. An\ninvestment in an ETF generally presents the\nsame primary risks as an investment in an\nopen-end investment company that is not\nexchange-traded and that has the same\ninvestment objectives, strategies, and\npolicies. However, ETFs are subject to the\nfollowing risks that do not apply to an open-\nend investment company that is not exchange-\ntraded: (i) the market price of the ETF's\nshares may trade at a discount to their net\nasset value; (ii) an active trading market for\nan ETF's shares may not develop or be\nmaintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's\nshares may be halted if the listing exchange's\nofficials deem such action appropriate, the\nshares are delisted from the exchange, or the\nactivation of market-wide \u201c circuit breakers \u201d\n(which are tied to large swings in stock\nprices) halts stock trading generally. Lending\nPortfolio Securities. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may lend portfolio securities\nto certain borrowers that BFA determines to be\ncreditworthy, including borrowers affiliated\nwith BFA. The borrowers provide collateral\nthat is maintained in an amount at least equal\nto the current market value of the securities\nloaned. No securities loan shall be made on\nbehalf of the Fund or Underlying Fund if, as a\nresult, the aggregate value of all securities\nloans of the Fund or Underlying Fund exceeds\none-third of the value of the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's total assets (including the\nvalue of the collateral received). The Fund or\nUnderlying Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the return of the securities\nloaned. The Fund or Underlying Fund receives,\nby way of substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund is compensated by a fee paid\nby the borrower equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral received by the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund for such loans, and uninvested\ncash, may be reinvested in certain short-term\ninstruments either directly on behalf of the\nFund or Underlying Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nOther investment companies in which the Fund\nor the Underlying Fund invests can be expected\nto incur fees and expenses for operations,\nsuch as investment advisory and administration\nfees, that would be in addition to those\nincurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund.\nThe Fund and Underlying Fund conducts its\nsecurities lending pursuant to an exemptive\norder from the SEC permitting it to lend\nportfolio securities to borrowers affiliated\nwith the Fund or Underlying Fund and to retain\nan affiliate of the Fund or Underlying Fund to\nact as securities lending agent. To the extent\nthat the Fund or Underlying Fund engages in\nsecurities lending, BlackRock Institutional\nTrust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund, subject to the overall\nsupervision of BFA. BTC administers the\nlending program in accordance with guidelines\napproved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of which are the \u201c\nTrustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c\nJPMorgan \u201d ) serves as custodian for the Fund\nin connection with certain securities lending\nactivities.\n\n8\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund has agreed to pay a borrower),\nforeign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a\nshortfall at default when a cash collateral\ninvestment is denominated in a currency other\nthan the currency of the assets being loaned\ndue to movements in foreign exchange rates),\nand credit, legal, counterparty and market\nrisks (including the risk that market events,\nincluding but not limited to corporate\nactions, could lead the Fund or Underlying\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund or Underlying Fund\nwould be subject to the risk of a possible\ndelay in receiving collateral or in recovering\nthe loaned securities, or to a possible loss\nof rights in the collateral. In the event a\nborrower does not return the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's ability to\nparticipate in a corporate action event may be\nimpacted, or the Fund or Underlying Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund or Underlying Fund. The Fund or\nUnderlying Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by the Fund or Underlying\nFund representing dividends paid on securities\nloaned out by the Fund or Underlying Fund will\nnot be considered qualified dividend income.\nBTC will take into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's securities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to the Fund or Underlying Fund\n(as permitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund or Underlying\nFund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose\nupon collateral, exercise other default rights\nor restrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's ability to terminate existing\nsecurities lending agreements or to realize\namounts to be received under such agreements.\nPrudential regulation may also favor lenders\nthat can provide additional protections, such\nas liens that are exercisable in connection\nwith a lender default, to borrowers. The Fund\nmay provide additional protections to\nborrowers, where permitted pursuant to the\nFund\u2019s investment policies and if BFA believes\ndoing so is in the best interest of the Fund.\nLiquidity Risk Management. Rule 22e-4 under\nthe Investment Company Act (the \u201c Liquidity\nRule \u201d ) requires open-end funds, including\nETFs such as the Fund, to establish a\nliquidity risk management program (the \u201c\nLiquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance disclosures\nregarding fund liquidity. As required by the\nLiquidity Rule, the Fund has implemented a\nLiquidity Program, and the Board, including a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees of the\nTrust, has appointed BFA as the administrator\nof the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews the Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nand classifies each investment held by the\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that the Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by the Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in the Fund. The liquidity\nof the Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, the Fund can expect to be exposed\nto greater liquidity risk. Regulation\nRegarding Derivatives. The CFTC subjects\nadvisers to registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if a fund that is\nadvised by the adviser either (i) invests,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than a prescribed\nlevel of its liquidation value in CFTC-\nregulated futures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. NDFs and cash-settled\ncurrency forwards as well as futures, options\non futures, currency options and swaps entered\ninto by the Fund will be treated as CFTC\n\n9\n\nDerivatives for these purposes. Physically-\nsettled foreign currency forward contracts\nwill generally be treated as CFTC Derivatives,\nhowever these contracts are not treated as\nCFTC regulated-swaps and are not subject to\ncertain of the CFTC\u2019s rules with respect to\nswaps. To the extent the Fund uses CFTC\nDerivatives, it intends to do so below such\nprescribed levels and intends not to market\nitself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a vehicle\nfor trading such instruments. BFA has claimed\nan exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\npursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. Derivative contracts,\nincluding, without limitation, swaps, currency\nforwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n( \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under\ncomparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable\nforwards and certain other derivatives traded\nin the OTC market are subject to variation\nmargin and initial margin requirements.\nImplementation of the margining and other\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding\nclearing, mandatory trading, reporting and\ndocumentation of swaps and other derivatives\nhave impacted and may continue to impact the\ncosts to the Fund of trading these instruments\nand, as a result, may affect returns to\ninvestors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into Derivatives Transactions (as\ndefined below) and certain other transactions\nnotwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g ., firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Securities of\nInvestment Companies. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in the securities\nof other investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law,\nregulation, exemptive order or SEC staff\nguidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund\u2019s\ninvestment in investment companies is limited\nto, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting stock of any one\ninvestment company, (ii) 5% of the fund\u2019s\ntotal assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which the Fund or the Underlying\nFund invests can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund\nor the Underlying Fund. Pursuant to guidance\nissued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of\nmoney market funds used for cash collateral\nreceived in connection with loans of\nsecurities are not treated as Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, which reflect the Fund's\npro rata share of the fees and expenses\nincurred by investing in other investment\ncompanies.\n\n10\n\nThe Fund or the Underlying Fund may purchase\nETF shares for the same reason it would\npurchase (and as an alternative to purchasing)\nfutures contracts \u2013 to obtain relatively low-\ncost exposure to the stock market while\nmaintaining flexibility to meet the liquidity\nneeds of the Underlying Fund. ETF shares enjoy\nseveral advantages over futures contracts.\nDepending on the market, the holding period,\nand other factors, ETF shares can be less\ncostly than futures contracts. In addition,\nETF shares can be purchased for smaller sums\nand offer exposure to market sectors and\nstyles for which there is no suitable or\nliquid futures contract. The Underlying Fund\nmay also purchase ETF shares for other\npurposes, including improving its ability to\ntrack its underlying index. The Underlying\nFund may invest in shares of ETFs that are\nadvised by BFA. Short-Term Instruments and\nTemporary Investments. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019\nacceptances, fixed-time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global\nRatings, or if unrated, of comparable quality\nas determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by the Fund. Any\nof these instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. See Risks of the Underlying Fund\nbelow. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe board of the Fund or the Underlying Fund\nmay, in the future, authorize the Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund to invest in securities\ncontracts and investments, other than those\nlisted in this SAI and in the Prospectus,\nprovided they are consistent with the Fund's\nor the Underlying Fund's investment objective\nand do not violate any of its investment\nrestrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. Because the Fund expects to obtain\nits exposure to the securities substantially\nthrough its investment in the Underlying Fund,\nshareholders should be aware that the risks of\ninvestment in particular types of securities,\neconomic sectors and geographic locations\ndiscussed below may be borne by the Fund\nthrough its investment in the Underlying Fund.\nThrough its investment in the Underlying Fund,\nthe Fund will also bear the risks described\nbelow associated with the Underlying Fund's\nuse of portfolio management techniques, such\nas borrowing arrangements and use of\nderivatives, in addition to the risks\nassociated with those activities if the Fund\nengages in them directly. An investment in the\nFund should be made with an understanding that\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities,\nincluding its investment in the Underlying\nFund, may fluctuate in accordance with changes\nin the financial condition of the issuers of\nthe portfolio securities, the value of stocks\nin general, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations.\n\n11\n\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Money Market Instruments\nRisk. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may hold\nmoney market instruments. The value of money\nmarket instruments may be affected by changes\nin interest rates or in the credit ratings of\nthe investments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of the Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's other service providers may\nexperience disruptions or operating errors\nsuch as processing errors or human errors,\ninadequate or failed internal or external\nprocesses, or systems or technology failures,\nthat could negatively impact the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's in\nthe setting of priorities, the personnel and\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring\nand oversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund or Underlying Fund service\nproviders to identify all of the operational\nrisks that may affect the Fund or Underlying\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Risk of Derivatives. A\nderivative is a financial contract, the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, such as a\nsecurity, a commodity (such as gold or\nsilver), a currency or an index (a measure of\nvalue or rates, such as the S&P 500 or the\nprime lending rate). The Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in stock index\nfutures contracts, securities options and\nother derivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's losses may be greater if it\ninvests in derivatives than if it invests only\nin conventional securities. Derivatives are\nalso subject to counterparty risk, which is\nthe risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage.\n\n12\n\nWhen a derivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that the Fund holds or is committed\nto purchase, any loss generated by the\nderivative generally should be substantially\noffset by gains on the hedged investment, and\nvice versa. While hedging can reduce or\neliminate losses, it can also reduce or\neliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand the Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that the Fund\u2019s\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risks of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Underlying Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof preferred or common stocks in general and\nother factors that affect the market. An\ninvestment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in equity securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of\nissuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the stock market may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of shares of\nthe Underlying Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as market confidence and\nperceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Holders of common stocks incur more\nrisk than holders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders\ngenerally have rights to receive payments from\nthe issuer inferior to the rights of creditors\nor holders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however, is\nsubject to market fluctuations prior to\nmaturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Risk of Futures and Options on\nFutures Transactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nunderlying instrument. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of loss of margin deposits\nin the event of bankruptcy of a broker with\nwhom the Fund has an open position in the\nfutures contract or option. The purchase of\nput or call options will be based upon\npredictions by BFA as to anticipated trends,\nwhich predictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin.\n\n13\n\nTracking Error Risk. The Underlying Fund may\nbe subject to tracking error, which is the\ndivergence of a fund\u2019s performance from that\nof its underlying index. Tracking error may\noccur because of differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments held in a\nfund\u2019s portfolio and those included in the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s underlying index, pricing\ndifferences, transaction costs incurred by the\nUnderlying Fund, Underlying Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Underlying Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to maintain\npass-through tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s underlying index or the\ncosts to the Underlying Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing regulatory\nrequirements. This risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions. Tracking\nerror also may result because a fund incurs\nfees and expenses, while such a fund\u2019s\nunderlying index does not. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by the Underlying Fund, BFA may\nconduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the re-\nbalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s portfolio and, if it\ndoes so, such a fund will be subject to\nincreased tracking error due to the divergence\nin the securities included in its portfolio\nfrom its underlying index. The application of\nthe above-mentioned analysis and screening to\nthe Underlying Fund and its underlying index\nis in the sole discretion of BFA and its\naffiliates (without any guarantees). The\nanalysis and screening may not exclude any or\nall high risk securities from the Underlying\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nsuch a Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more\nsuch securities declines in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation and/or an economic recession in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and\nlegislative changes in the U.S. are changing\nmany aspects of financial, commercial, public\nhealth, environmental, and other regulation\nand may have a significant effect on U.S.\nmarkets generally, as well as on the value of\ncertain securities. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will continue to\nmaintain elevated public debt levels for the\nforeseeable future. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily indicate or cause\neconomic problems, elevated public debt\nservice costs may constrain future economic\ngrowth. Circumstances could arise that could\nprevent the timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government debt, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in substantial\nnegative consequences for the U.S. economy and\nthe global financial system. If U.S. relations\nwith certain countries deteriorate, it could\nadversely affect U.S. issuers as well as\nnon-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for\ntrade. The U.S. has also experienced increased\ninternal unrest and discord. If these trends\nwere to continue, it may have an adverse\nimpact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in\nwhich the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.\nRisk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nstaples sector may also be affected by changes\nin global economic, environmental\n\n14\n\nand political events, economic conditions, the\ndepletion of resources, and government\nregulation. For instance, government\nregulations may affect the permissibility of\nusing various food additives and production\nmethods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability. In\naddition, tobacco companies may be adversely\naffected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector also may be\nsubject to risks pertaining to the supply of,\ndemand for and prices of raw materials. The\nprices of raw materials fluctuate in response\nto a number of factors, including, without\nlimitation, changes in government agricultural\nsupport programs, exchange rates, import and\nexport controls, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in an Underlying\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, an\nUnderlying Fund could lose all or a\nsubstantial portion of its investment. The\nenergy sector is cyclical and is highly\ndependent on commodity prices. Prices and\nsupplies of energy may fluctuate significantly\nover short and long periods of time due to,\namong other things, national and international\npolitical changes, Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d ) policies,\nchanges in relationships among OPEC members\nand between OPEC and oil-importing nations,\nthe regulatory environment, taxation policies,\nthe enactment or cessation of trade sanctions,\nwar or other geopolitical conflicts, and the\neconomies of key energy-consuming countries.\nCompanies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by terrorism, cyber\nincidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in the Financials Sector. Companies\nin the financials sector include small,\nregional and money center banks, securities\nbrokerage firms, asset management companies,\nsavings banks and thrift institutions,\nspecialty finance companies ( e.g. , credit\ncard, mortgage providers), insurance and\ninsurance brokerage firms, consumer finance\nfirms, financial conglomerates and foreign\nbanking and financial companies. Most\nfinancial companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which the Underlying\nFund invests, including legislation in many\ncountries that may increase government\n\n15\n\nregulation, repatriation and other\nintervention. The impact of governmental\nintervention and legislative changes on any\nindividual financial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have\n\n16\n\na material adverse effect on a company\u2019s\nbusiness. Healthcare companies may also be\nstrongly affected by scientific biotechnology\nor technological developments, and their\nproducts may quickly become obsolete. Also,\nmany healthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace\nand defense companies, a component of the\nindustrials sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on government\ndemand for their products and services. Thus,\nthe financial condition of, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace and defense companies\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense\nspending policies, which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control government\nbudgets. Transportation stocks, a component of\nthe industrials sector, are cyclical and can\nbe significantly affected by economic changes,\nfuel prices, labor relations and insurance\ncosts. Transportation companies in certain\ncountries may also be subject to significant\ngovernment regulation and oversight, which may\nadversely affect their businesses. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\n\n17\n\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a\n\n18\n\ngreater credit risk of default due to the need\nto service more senior debt of the issuer.\nSimilarly, preferred equity investments\ninvolve a greater risk of loss than\nconventional debt financing due to their non-\ncollateralized nature and subordinated\nranking. Investments in CMBS may also be\njunior in priority in the event of bankruptcy\nor similar proceedings. Investments in senior\nloans may be effectively subordinated if the\nsenior loan is pledged as collateral. The\nability of a holder of junior claims to\nproceed against a defaulting issuer is\ncircumscribed by the terms of the particular\ncontractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, an Underlying Fund may at times need to\nrequest permission to extend the deadline for\nissuing your tax reporting statement or\nsupplement the information otherwise provided\nto you. Risk of Investing in the Utilities\nSector. The utilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changing commodity prices,\ngovernment regulation stipulating rates\ncharged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the construction of\nelectric transmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in the Underlying Fund's portfolio may\nown or operate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policies The Board has delegated the\nvoting of proxies for each Fund\u2019s securities\nto BFA pursuant to (i) the Open-End Active and\nFixed Income Index Fund Proxy Voting Policy\n(the \u201c Active Fund Proxy Voting Policy \u201d ),\nwith respect to certain Funds, and (ii) the\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy, with\nrespect to certain other Funds, as applicable.\nPlease refer to the table below, which\ndiscloses the policy applicable to each Fund\nin this SAI. Information that does not apply\nto a Fund does not form a part of that Fund\u2019s\nSAI and should not be relied on by investors\nin that Fund. Only information that is clearly\nidentified as applicable to a Fund is\nconsidered to form a part of that Fund\u2019s SAI.\n\n19\n\nWith respect to Funds covered by the Active\nFund Proxy Voting Policy, BFA has adopted the\nBlackRock Active Investment Stewardship -\nGlobal Engagement and Voting Guidelines (the \u201c\nBAIS Guidelines \u201d ). Certain of such Funds, as\nlisted within the Active Fund Proxy Voting\nPolicy and as disclosed in the table below,\nfollow supplemental guidelines within the BAIS\nGuidelines that are applicable to certain\nclimate and decarbonization issues (the \u201c BAIS\nClimate and Decarbonization Stewardship\nGuidelines \u201d ). With respect to Funds covered\nby the Index Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy,\nBFA has adopted the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) Global Benchmark\nPolicy, comprised of the Global Principles for\nBenchmark Policies, regional voting\nguidelines, and engagement priorities, which\nare each available upon request. In addition,\ncertain of such Funds, as listed within the\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy and as\ndisclosed in the table below, follow\nsupplemental guidelines that are applicable to\ncertain climate and decarbonization issues\n(the \u201c BIS Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines \u201d ).\n                                              \n          Open-E\u2026           Index             \n          and      BAIS     Equity   BIS      \n  Fund    FixedI\u2026  Climat\u2026  Fund     Climat\u2026  \n          IndexF\u2026  Decarb\u2026  ProxyV\u2026  Decarb\u2026  \n          ProxyV\u2026  Apply    Policy   Apply    \n          Policy                              \n  iShar\u2026                                      \n  Large                                       \n  Cap     X                                   \n  Accel\u2026                                      \n  Outco\u2026                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nIf a Fund invests in an underlying fund\nmanaged by BlackRock, the Fund will use its\nproxy voting policy when voting on proxies for\nthe underlying fund while the underlying fund\nwill use its proxy voting policy when voting\nproxies on investments the underlying fund\nholds. Therefore, the Fund may use the Active\nFund Proxy Voting Policy while an underlying\nfund may use the Index Equity Fund Proxy\nVoting Policy, and the opposite is also true.\nCopies of the Active Fund Proxy Voting Policy,\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy, the\nBAIS Guidelines, the Global Principles for\nBenchmark Policies and the BIS Climate and\nDecarbonization Stewardship Guidelines are\nincluded in Appendix A of this SAI.\nInformation with respect to how proxies\nrelating to each Fund\u2019s portfolio securities,\nwhen available, were voted during the 12-month\nperiod ended June 30 is available: (i) without\ncharge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund\u2019s website\nat www.blackrock.com/proxyrecords; and (ii) on\nthe SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. Portfolio\nHoldings Information On each Business Day (as\ndefined in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI), prior to\nthe opening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities the Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that the\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling the Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement.\n\n20\n\n\u2022 Communications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for the\nFund as needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nInvestment Policies The Board has adopted as\nfundamental policies the following numbered\ninvestment policies, which cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i)\n67% or more of the voting securities present\nat a shareholder meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund. The\nFund has also adopted certain non-fundamental\ninvestment policies, including its investment\nobjective. Non-fundamental investment policies\nmay be changed by the Board without\nshareholder approval. Therefore, the Fund may\nchange its investment objective without\nshareholder approval. Fundamental Investment\nPolicies of the Fund. The Fund may not: 1.\nPurchase the securities of issuers conducting\ntheir principal business activity in the same\nindustry if, immediately after the purchase\nand as a result thereof, the value of the\nFund\u2019s investments in that industry would\nequal or exceed 25% of the current value of\nthe Fund\u2019s total assets, provided that this\nrestriction does not limit the Fund\u2019s: (i)\ninvestments in securities of other investment\ncompanies, (ii) investments in securities\nissued or guaranteed by the U.S. government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities, or (iii)\ninvestments in repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities.\n2. Borrow money, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof real estate investment trusts, mortgage-\nrelated securities\n\n21\n\nand securities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Notations Regarding\nthe Fund\u2019s Fundamental Investment Policies The\nfollowing notations are not considered to be\npart of the Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund\u2019s industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund\u2019s total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f- 4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\n\n22\n\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFund. Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, the Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). The\nforegoing restriction does not restrict the\nFund from acquiring the shares of registered\nopen-end investment companies to the extent\notherwise permissible under other provisions\nof the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 2.\nUnder normal market conditions, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large-capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the Accelerated\nReturn or for the Approximate Cap with respect\nto securities of large-capitalization\ncompanies. The Fund will notify its\nshareholders at least 60 days prior to any\nchange in its restrictions described in 2\nabove. Notations Regarding the Fund\u2019s\nFundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment\nPolicies Unless otherwise indicated, all\nlimitations under the Fund\u2019s fundamental or\nnon-fundamental investment restrictions apply\nonly at the time that a transaction is\nundertaken. Any change in the percentage of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets invested in certain\nsecurities or other instruments resulting from\nmarket fluctuations or other changes in the\nFund\u2019s total assets will not require the Fund\nto dispose of an investment. Continuous\nOffering The method by which Creation Units\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units are issued and sold\nby the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nrequirement and liability provisions of the\n1933 Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent shares and sells\nsuch shares directly to customers or if it\nchooses to couple the creation of new shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nshares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must\ntake into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nshares, generally are required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\n1933 Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of\nthe 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus\ndelivery obligation with respect to shares of\nthe Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule\n153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the\n\n23\n\nprospectus is available at the Listing\nExchange upon request. The prospectus delivery\nmechanism provided in Rule 153 is available\nonly with respect to transactions on an\nexchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Fund,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nThe Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 416 funds\nas of December 30, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12\nThrogmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United\nKingdom.

A Trustee\u2019s ability to\nperform his or her duties effectively may have\nbeen attained through the Trustee\u2019s\neducational background or professional\ntraining; business, consulting, public service\nor academic positions; experience from service\nas a Board member of the Fund and the other\nfunds in the Trust (and any predecessor\nfunds), other investment funds, public\n\n27\n\ncompanies, or non-profit entities or other\norganizations; and/or other life experiences.\nAlso, set forth below is a brief discussion of\nthe specific experience, qualifications,\nattributes or skills of each Trustee that led\nthe Board to conclude that he or she should\nserve (or continue to serve) as a Trustee.\nRobert S.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The\n\n30\n\nIndependent Trustees meet regularly outside\nthe presence of management, in executive\nsession or with other service providers to the\nTrust. The Board has appointed an Independent\nTrustee to serve in the role of Board Chair.\nThe Board Chair\u2019s role is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Board and to act as a liaison\nwith service providers, officers, attorneys,\nand other Trustees generally between meetings.\nThe Board Chair may also perform such other\nfunctions as may be delegated by the Board\nfrom time to time. The Board has established\nseven standing Committees: a Nominating and\nGovernance Committee, an Audit Committee, a\n15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending\nCommittee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus\nCommittee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to\nassist the Board in the oversight and\ndirection of the business and affairs of the\nFund, and from time to time the Board may\nestablish ad hoc committees or informal\nworking groups to review and address the\npolicies and practices of the Fund with\nrespect to certain specified matters. The\nChair of each standing Committee is an\nIndependent Trustee. The role of the Chair of\neach Committee is to preside at all meetings\nof the Committee and to act as a liaison with\nservice providers, officers, attorneys and\nother Trustees between meetings. Each standing\nCommittee meets regularly to conduct the\noversight functions delegated to the Committee\nby the Board and reports its finding to the\nBoard. The Board and each standing Committee\nconduct annual assessments of their oversight\nfunction and structure. The Board has\ndetermined that the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure is appropriate because it allows the\nBoard to exercise independent judgment over\nmanagement and it allocates areas of\nresponsibility among committees of Independent\nTrustees and the full Board to enhance\neffective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Fund's investment performance\nor other activities.

Control Persons and\nPrincipal Holders of Securities. Ownership\ninformation is not provided for the Fund, as\nit has not commenced operations as of the date\nof this SAI. Conflicts of Interest. Certain\nactivities of BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock\nAdvisors, LLC, BlackRock Fund Advisors and the\nother subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ) and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees, with respect to the\nFunds and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give rise to actual or\nperceived conflicts of interest such as those\ndescribed below. BlackRock is one of the\nworld\u2019s largest asset management firms.\nBlackRock, its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers and employees,\nincluding the business units or entities and\npersonnel who may be involved in the\ninvestment activities and business operations\nof a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities, fixed\nincome securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and other financial services, and\nhave interests other than that of\n\n36\n\nmanaging the Funds. These are considerations\nof which investors in a Fund should be aware,\nand which may cause conflicts of interest that\ncould disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. These businesses and interests\ninclude potential multiple advisory,\ntransactional, financial and other\nrelationships with, or interests in companies\nand interests in securities or other\ninstruments that may be purchased or sold by a\nFund. BlackRock has proprietary interests in,\nand may manage or advise with respect to,\naccounts or funds (including separate accounts\nand other funds and collective investment\nvehicles) that have investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or that engage\nin transactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies and instruments as the\nFund. BlackRock is also a major participant in\nthe global currency, equities, swap and fixed\nincome markets, in each case, for the accounts\nof clients and, in some cases, on a\nproprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or\nmay be actively engaged in transactions in the\nsame securities, currencies, and instruments\nin which a Fund invests. Such activities could\naffect the prices and availability of the\nsecurities, currencies, and instruments in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could have an\nadverse impact on a Fund\u2019s performance. Such\ntransactions, particularly in respect of most\nproprietary accounts or client accounts, will\nbe executed independently of a Fund\u2019s\ntransactions and thus at prices or rates that\nmay be more or less favorable than those\nobtained by the Fund. In addition, the\nportfolio holdings of certain BlackRock-\nadvised investment vehicles managed in an\nidentical or substantially similar manner as\ncertain Funds are made publicly available on a\nmore timely basis than the applicable Fund. In\nsome cases, such portfolio holdings are made\npublicly available on a daily basis. While not\nexpected, it is possible that a recipient of\nportfolio holdings information for such an\ninvestment vehicle could cause harm to a Fund\nthat is managed in an identical or\nsubstantially similar manner, including by\ntrading ahead of or against such Fund based on\nthe information received. When BlackRock seeks\nto purchase or sell the same assets for client\naccounts, including a Fund, the assets\nactually purchased or sold may be allocated\namong the accounts on a basis determined in\nits good faith discretion to be equitable. In\nsome cases, this system may adversely affect\nthe size or price of the assets purchased or\nsold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. BlackRock, on behalf\nof other client accounts, on the one hand, and\na Fund, on the other hand, may invest in or\nextend credit to different parts of the\ncapital structure of a single issuer.\nBlackRock may pursue rights, provide advice or\nengage in other activities, or refrain from\npursuing rights, providing advice or engaging\nin other activities, on behalf of other\nclients with respect to an issuer in which a\nFund has invested, and such actions (or\nrefraining from action) may have a material\nadverse effect on the Fund. In situations in\nwhich clients of BlackRock (including the\nFunds) hold positions in multiple parts of the\ncapital structure of an issuer, BlackRock may\nnot pursue certain actions or remedies that\nmay be available to a Fund, as a result of\nlegal and regulatory requirements or\notherwise. BlackRock addresses these and other\npotential conflicts of interest based on the\nfacts and circumstances of particular\nsituations. For example, BlackRock may\ndetermine to rely on information barriers\nbetween different business units or portfolio\nmanagement teams. BlackRock may also determine\nto rely on the actions of similarly situated\nholders of loans or securities rather than, or\nin connection with, taking such actions itself\non behalf of the Funds.\n\n37\n\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, certain Funds may invest their\nassets in other funds advised by BlackRock,\nincluding funds that are managed by one or\nmore of the same portfolio managers, which\ncould result in conflicts of interest relating\nto asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases\nand redemptions or sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party\u2019s investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. BlackRock and its\nclients may pursue or enforce rights with\nrespect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund\u2019s investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) that it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The net asset value and liquidity of\na Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by model-driven investment\nportfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself and\nby its advisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such other business units or entities or\ntheir clients and such obligations to other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nmay be a consideration of which investors in a\nFund should be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock, or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock, serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty\u2019s interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and\n\n38\n\nsuch party may have no incentive to assure\nthat the Fund obtains the best possible prices\nor terms in connection with the transactions.\nIn addition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for\nclients, the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments of which may be those in which\na Fund invests or which may be based on the\nperformance of the Fund. Additionally, an\naffiliate of BlackRock will create, write or\nissue options, which may be based on the\nperformance of certain Funds. BlackRock has\nentered into an arrangement with Markit\nIndices Limited, the index provider for\nunderlying fixed-income indexes used by\ncertain iShares ETFs, related to derivative\nfixed-income products that are based on such\niShares ETFs. Trading activity in these\nderivative products could also potentially\nlead to greater liquidity for such products,\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares ETFs and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund. At\ntimes, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of\nthe Fund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arms-length basis. To the extent authorized\nby applicable law, BlackRock may act as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund. It is\nanticipated that the commissions, mark-ups,\nmarkdowns, financial advisory fees,\nunderwriting and placement fees, sales fees,\nfinancing and commitment fees, brokerage fees,\nother fees, compensation or profits, rates,\nterms and conditions charged by BlackRock will\nbe in its view commercially reasonable,\nalthough BlackRock, including its sales\npersonnel, will have an interest in obtaining\nfees and other amounts that are favorable to\nBlackRock and such sales personnel, which may\nhave an adverse effect on the Funds. Index\nbased funds may use an index provider that is\naffiliated with another service provider of\nthe Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker,\ndealer, agent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel\nand other distributors) will be entitled to\nretain fees and other amounts that they\nreceive in connection with their service to\nthe Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. A Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund\u2019s own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with a Fund\u2019s establishment of its\nbusiness relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund\u2019s counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund\u2019s creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBlackRock, pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,\nacts as securities lending agent to, and\nreceives a share of securities lending\nrevenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also\nreceive compensation for managing the\nreinvestment of the cash collateral from\nsecurities lending. There are potential\nconflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/ or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\n\n39\n\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock may decline\nto make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. In addition, some\nborrowers may prefer certain BlackRock lenders\nthat provide additional protections against\nlender default that are favored by their\nprudential regulation. BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e . indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. BlackRock does\nnot currently enter into arrangements to use\nthe Fund\u2019s assets for, or participate in, soft\ndollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock\u2019s view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client\u2019s commissions may not be\nused in managing that client\u2019s account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock,\nunless prohibited by applicable law, may\nendeavor to execute trades through brokers\nwho, pursuant to such arrangements, provide\nresearch or other services in order to ensure\nthe continued receipt of research or other\nservices\n\n40\n\nBlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of client portfolios. In\naddition, transactions in ETF shares may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for the\nexecution of such orders. BlackRock has\nadopted policies and procedures designed to\nprevent conflicts of interest from influencing\nproxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf\nof advisory clients, including the Funds, and\nto help ensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee \u201c Proxy Voting Policies. \u201d It is also\npossible that, from time to time, BlackRock\nand /or its advisory clients (including other\nfunds and separately managed accounts) may,\nsubject to compliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing\na Fund\u2019s assets may enhance investment\nflexibility and diversification and may\ncontribute to economies of scale that tend to\nreduce the Fund\u2019s expense ratio. BlackRock\nreserves the right, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, to sell into the market or\nredeem in Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that a Fund may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in transactions with,\ncompanies in which BlackRock has significant\ndebt or equity investments or other interests.\nA Fund may also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock, in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund\u2019s flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock and\nits personnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other\n\n41\n\nproducts or services, and the remuneration and\nprofitability to BlackRock and such personnel\nresulting from transactions on behalf of or\nmanagement of the Funds may be greater than\nthe remuneration and profitability resulting\nfrom other funds or products. Third parties,\nincluding service providers to BlackRock or\nthe Fund, may sponsor events (including, but\nnot limited to, marketing and promotional\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs and conferences) for\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors. There\nis a potential conflict of interest as such\nsponsorships may defray the costs of such\nactivities to BlackRock, and may provide an\nincentive to BlackRock to retain such third\nparties to provide services to the Fund.\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients\u2019 accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by a Fund\u2019s pricing\nvendors, especially if such valuations are\nbased on broker-dealer quotes or other data\nsources unavailable to the Fund\u2019s pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations to a Fund\u2019s pricing vendors\nand/or fund accountants, there may be\ninstances where the Fund\u2019s pricing vendors or\nfund accountants assign a different valuation\nto a security or other investment than the\nvaluation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock. As\ndisclosed in more detail in \u201c Determination of\nNet Asset Value \u201d in this SAI, when market\nquotations are not readily available or are\nbelieved by BlackRock to be unreliable, a\nFund\u2019s investments are valued at fair value by\nBlackRock. BlackRock has been designated as\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to Rule\n2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts\nthrough BlackRock\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees and in accordance\nwith BlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (the\n\u201c Valuation Procedures \u201d ). When determining a\n\u201c fair value price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks\nto determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BlackRock\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BlackRock using\nproprietary or third party valuation models,\nfair value represents only a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. The fair value of one or more\nassets or liabilities may not, in retrospect,\nbe the price at which those assets or\nliabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BlackRock with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct, may pay its share of expenses of a money\nmarket fund or other similarly managed private\nfund in which it invests, which may result in\na Fund bearing some additional expenses.\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities or\nother investments for their own accounts and\nmay have conflicts of interest with respect to\ninvestments made on behalf of a Fund. As a\nresult of differing trading and investment\nstrategies or constraints, positions may be\ntaken by directors, officers and employees of\nBlackRock that are the same, different from or\nmade at different times than positions taken\nfor the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a\nFund will be adversely affected by this\npersonal trading, the Fund, BRIL and BlackRock\neach have adopted a Code of Ethics in\ncompliance with Section 17(j) of the\nInvestment Company Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding the Fund\u2019s portfolio transactions.\nEach Code of Ethics is also available on the\nEDGAR Database on the SEC\u2019s Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\na Fund, except that the Fund may in accordance\nwith rules or guidance adopted under the\nInvestment Company Act engage in transactions\nwith another Fund or accounts that are\naffiliated with the Fund as a result of common\nofficers, directors, or investment advisers or\npursuant to exemptive orders granted to the\nFunds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These\ntransactions would be effected in\ncircumstances in which BlackRock determined\nthat it would be appropriate for the Fund to\npurchase and another client of BlackRock to\nsell, or the Fund to sell and another client\nof BlackRock to purchase, the same security or\ninstrument on the\n\n42\n\nsame day. From time to time, the activities of\na Fund may be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock\u2019s internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when BlackRock may not initiate\nor recommend certain types of transactions, or\nmay otherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g ., in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Funds wish to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. BlackRock has adopted\nand implemented policies and procedures that\nare designed to address potential conflicts\nthat arise in connection with the advisory\nservices BlackRock provides to Funds and other\nclients. Certain BlackRock advisory personnel\nmay take views, and make decisions or\nrecommendations, that are different than or\nopposite those of other BlackRock advisory\npersonnel. Certain portfolio management teams\nwithin BlackRock may make decisions or take\n(or refrain from taking) actions with respect\nto clients they advise in a manner different\nthan or adverse to the decisions made or the\nactions taken (or not taken) by the Funds\u2019\nportfolio management teams. The various\nportfolio management teams may not share\ninformation with each other, including as a\nresult of certain information barriers and\nother policies, and will not have any\nobligation or other duty to do so. BlackRock\nhas established certain information barriers\nand other policies to address the sharing of\ninformation between different businesses\nwithin BlackRock, including, effective on or\nabout January 21, 2025, with respect to\npersonnel responsible with managing portfolios\nand voting proxies with respect to certain\nindex equity portfolios versus those\nresponsible for managing portfolios and voting\nproxies with respect to all other portfolios.\nAs a result of information barriers, certain\nunits of BlackRock generally will not have\naccess, or will have limited access, to\ncertain information and personnel, including\nsenior personnel, in other units of BlackRock,\nand generally will not manage the Funds with\nthe benefit of information possessed by such\nother units. Therefore, BlackRock may not be\nable to review potential investments for the\nFunds with the benefit of information held by\ncertain areas of BlackRock. BlackRock may\ndetermine to move certain personnel,\nbusinesses, or business units from one side of\nan information barrier to the other side of\nthe information barrier. In connection\ntherewith, BlackRock personnel, businesses,\nand business units that were moved will no\nlonger have access to the information and\npersonnel from the side of the information\nbarrier from which they were moved.\nInformation obtained in connection with such\nchanges to information barriers may limit or\nrestrict the ability of BlackRock to engage in\nor otherwise effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Funds (including purchasing or selling\nsecurities that BlackRock may otherwise have\npurchased or sold for a client in the absence\nof a change to an information barrier).\nInformation barriers may not have their\nintended impact due to, for example, changes\nin applicable law or inadvertent crossings of\nthe barriers, and actions by personnel on one\nside of a barrier may impact the potential\nactions of personnel on the other side of a\nbarrier. Although the information barriers are\nintended to allow for independent portfolio\nmanagement decision making and proxy voting\namong certain BlackRock businesses, the\ninvestment activities of BlackRock for\nBlackRock clients, as well as BlackRock\u2019s\nproprietary accounts, may nonetheless limit\nthe investment strategies and rights of other\nclients (including the Funds). As BlackRock\u2019s\nassets under management increases, BlackRock\nclients may face greater negative impacts due\nto ownership restrictions and limitations\nimposed by laws, regulations, rules,\nregulators, or issuers. For example, in\ncertain circumstances where a BlackRock client\ninvests in securities issued by companies that\noperate in certain industries ( e.g .,\nbanking, insurance, and utilities) or in\ncertain emerging or international markets, or\nare subject to regulatory or corporate\nownership restrictions ( e.g ., with\nmechanisms such as poison pills in place to\nprevent takeovers), or where a BlackRock\nclient invests in certain futures and\nderivatives, there may be limits on the\naggregate amount invested by BlackRock for its\nclients and BlackRock\u2019s proprietary accounts\nthat may not be exceeded without the grant of\na license or other regulatory or corporate\napproval, order, consent, relief, waiver or\nnon-disapproval or, if exceeded, may cause\nBlackRock or its clients to be subject to\nenforcement actions, disgorgement of share\nownership or profits, regulatory restrictions,\ncomplex compliance reporting, increased\ncompliance costs or suffer disadvantages or\nbusiness restrictions. In light of certain\nrestrictions,\n\n43\n\nBlackRock may also seek to make indirect\ninvestments ( e.g ., using derivatives) on\nbehalf of its clients to receive exposure to\ncertain securities in excess of the applicable\nownership restrictions and limitations when\nlegally permitted that will expose such\nclients to additional costs and additional\nrisks, including any risks associated with\ninvesting in derivatives. There may be limited\navailability of derivatives that provide\nindirect exposure to an impacted security. In\naddition, BlackRock clients can be subject to\nmore than one ownership limitation depending\non each client\u2019s holdings, and each ownership\nlimitation can impact multiple securities held\nby the client. Certain clients or shareholders\nmay have their own overlapping obligations to\nmonitor their compliance with ownership\nlimitations across their investments. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a BlackRock client or as a result\nof corporate actions by the issuer, the\nability of BlackRock on behalf of clients to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights (including voting) or\nundertake business transactions, may be\nrestricted by law, regulation, rule, or\norganizational documents or otherwise\nimpaired. For example, to meet the\nrequirements of an ownership limitation or\nrestriction, a client may be unable to\npurchase or directly hold a security the\nclient would otherwise purchase or hold. The\nlimitation or restriction may be based on the\nholdings of other BlackRock clients instead of\nthe specific client being restricted. For\nindex funds, this means a fund may not be able\nto track its index as closely as it would if\nit was not subject to an ownership limitation\nor restriction because the fund cannot acquire\nthe amount of the impacted security included\nin its index. BlackRock on behalf of its\nclients may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, utilize indirect investments,\nutilize information barriers, or otherwise\nrestrict, forgo, or limit the exercise of\nrights (including transferring, outsourcing,\nor limiting voting rights or forgoing the\nright to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in\nits sole discretion, deems it appropriate in\nlight of potential regulatory or other\nrestrictions on ownership or other\nconsequences resulting from reaching\ninvestment thresholds. These types of\nrestrictions could negatively impact a\nclient\u2019s performance or ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. When BlackRock or a\nBlackRock client is subject to an ownership\nlimitation, BlackRock may in its discretion\nseek permission from the applicable issuers or\nregulators to exceed the limitation. However,\nthere is no guarantee that permission will be\ngranted, or that, once granted, it will not be\nmodified or revoked at a later date with\nminimal or no notice. The issuer and/or\nregulator may also require that BlackRock on\nbehalf of itself and its clients take or\nrefrain from taking certain actions in\nconnection with the approval, order, consent,\nrelief or non-disapproval, which BlackRock may\naccept if it believes the benefits outweigh\nthe costs and may limit BlackRock from taking\nactions that it otherwise would take. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients, taking into\nconsideration benchmark weight and investment\nstrategy. BlackRock may adopt certain controls\ndesigned to prevent the occurrence of a breach\nof any applicable ownership threshold or\nlimits, including, for example, when ownership\nin certain securities nears an applicable\nthreshold, BlackRock may limit additional\npurchases in such securities or, with respect\nto ETFs, remove such securities from the list\nof Deposit Securities to be delivered to the\nFund in connection with purchases of Creation\nUnits of such Fund. If client holdings of an\nissuer exceed an applicable threshold and\nBlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable\nthe continued holding of such investments, it\nmay be necessary to reduce these positions to\nmeet the applicable limitations and BlackRock\nor such client may be subject to regulatory\nactions. In these cases, the investments will\nbe sold in a manner that BlackRock deems fair\nand equitable over time. Ownership limitations\nare highly complex. It is possible that,\ndespite BlackRock\u2019s intent to either comply\nwith or be granted permission to exceed\nownership limitations, it may inadvertently\nbreach a limit or violate the corporate or\nregulatory approval, order, consent, relief or\nnon-disapproval that was obtained. In addition\nto the foregoing, other ownership thresholds\nmay trigger reporting requirements to\ngovernmental and regulatory authorities, and\nsuch reports may entail the disclosure of the\nidentity of a client or BlackRock\u2019s intended\nstrategy with respect to such security or\nasset. BlackRock may not serve as an\nAuthorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has, when\napplicable, retained BlackRock Investments,\nLLC (the \u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform certain order\nprocessing, Authorized Participant\ncommunications, and related services in\nconnection with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or redemption\norder from the Authorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated\nwith, and received payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\naffiliates.\n\n44\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nthe Fund may collect certain fees from\nAuthorized Participants in connection with\ncash substitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Fund in\ndetermining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Fund related to creation and redemption\nactivity, BlackRock may have incentives to\nimprove Fund performance through the\ncollection of these fees. As these charges are\nbased on estimates, where the charges exceed\nactual transaction-related costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by the Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Funds may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof their investment strategy. Index based\nfunds that seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g ., custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/ or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not affect Fund fees and\nexpenses applicable to such client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock and its directors,\nofficers and employees, in addition to those\ndescribed in this section, may give rise to\nadditional conflicts of interest.\n\n45\n\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee from the Fund based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets, at the annual\nrate of 0.50%. BFA has contractually agreed to\nwaive a portion of its management fees in an\namount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other funds advised by BFA or\nits affiliates, through November 30, 2030. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2030 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act). The investment\nadvisory agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by BFA and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act).

As of December 31, 2024, the\nindividuals named as Portfolio Managers in the\nFund's Prospectus were also primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nother iShares funds and certain other types of\nportfolios and/or accounts as follows:\n                                              \n  Matthew DeCicco                             \n  Types of Accounts     Number  Total Assets  \n  Registered            N/A     N/A           \n  Investment Companies                        \n  Other Pooled          N/A     N/A           \n  Investment Vehicles                         \n  Other Accounts        N/A     N/A           \n                                              \n46\n                                              \n  Orlando Montalvo                            \n  Types of Accounts   Number    Total Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment              13  $8,939,000,000  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment              17   1,293,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts           8       2,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below shows, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of December 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  Matthew                                     \n  DeCicco                                     \n                Number of                     \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts      FeesManaged    Total Assets   \n                by Portfolio                  \n                Manager                       \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment    N/A            N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment    N/A            N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other         N/A            N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Orlando                                     \n  Montalvo                                    \n                Number of                     \n                Other                         \n  Types of      Accountswith   Aggregateof    \n  Accounts      Performance    Total Assets   \n                FeesManaged                   \n                by Portfolio                  \n                Manager                       \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment    N/A            N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment    N/A            N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other         N/A            N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of December 31,\n2024. BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements\nwith its portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation\n\n47\n\ninclude a base salary, a performance-based\ndiscretionary bonus, participation in various\nbenefits programs and one or more of the\nincentive compensation programs established by\nBlackRock, Inc. Each portfolio manager\nreceives base compensation based on their\nposition with the firm, as well as retirement\nand other benefits offered to all BlackRock\nemployees. Additionally, each portfolio\nmanager receives discretionary incentive\ncompensation, determined based on several\ncomponents, including: the performance of\nBlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its underlying index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of December 31, 2024,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. The Bank of New York Mellon (\n\u201c BNY Mellon \u201d ) serves as administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for the Fund\nunder the Master Services Agreement (the \u201c\nMaster Services Agreement \u201d ). BNY Mellon\u2019s\nprincipal address is 240 Greenwich Street, New\nYork, NY 10286. Pursuant to the Master\nServices Agreement with the Trust, BNY Mellon\nprovides necessary administrative, tax and\naccounting and financial reporting services\nfor the maintenance and operations of the\nTrust and the Fund. In addition, BNY Mellon\nmakes available the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, BNY Mellon\nmaintains, in separate accounts, cash,\nsecurities and other assets of the Trust and\nthe Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and\nrecords and provides other services. BNY\nMellon is required, upon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by BNY\nMellon and to make payments for securities\npurchased by the Trust for the Fund. BNY\nMellon is authorized to appoint certain\nforeign custodians or foreign custody managers\nfor Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant\nto the Master Services Agreement with the\nTrust, BNY Mellon acts as a transfer agent for\nthe Fund\u2019s authorized and issued shares of\nbeneficial interest, and as dividend\ndisbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation\nfor these services, BNY Mellon receives\ncertain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees\nand asset-based fees which are accrued daily\nand paid monthly by BFA. BFA pays the\ncompensation because it has agreed to pay\nthese operating expenses under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement as described therein.\nJPMorgan serves as custodian for the Fund in\nconnection with certain securities lending\nactivities under a Custody Services Agreement.\nJPMorgan\u2019s principal address is 383 Madison\nAvenue, 11 th Floor, New York, NY 10179.\nPursuant to the Custody Services Agreement\nwith BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides\ncustody and related services required to\nfacilitate securities lending by the Fund.\nJPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary\nto facilitate Fund securities lending activity\nin coordination with other funds, maintains\ncustodial records and provides other services.\nAs compensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC\nfrom its compensation for its services as\nsecurities lending agent.\n\n48\n\nDistributor. The Distributor's principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. Shares are continuously offered for\nsale by the Fund through the Distributor or\nits agent only in Creation Units, as described\nin the Prospectus and below in the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than\nCreation Units are generally not distributed\nby the Distributor or its agent. The\nDistributor or its agent will arrange for the\ndelivery of the Prospectus and, upon request,\nthis SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units\nand will maintain records of both orders\nplaced with it or its agents and confirmations\nof acceptance furnished by it or its agents.\nThe Distributor is a broker-dealer registered\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,\nInc. ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), DTC participants and/or\ninvestor services organizations. BFA or its\naffiliates may, from time to time and from its\nown resources, pay, defray or absorb costs\nrelating to distribution, including payments\nout of its own resources to the Distributor,\nor to otherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). If the Fund were to\nengage in securities lending, it would retain\na portion of the securities lending income and\nremit the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. To the\nextent that the Fund engages in securities\nlending, the Fund is responsible for fees in\nconnection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan in\na money market fund managed by BFA (the \u201c\ncollateral investment fees \u201d ); however, BTC\nhas agreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees the Fund bears to an annual rate of\n0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not\nbe subject to a sales load, redemption fee,\ndistribution fee or service fee. To the extent\nthat the Fund invests cash collateral in a\nnon-government money market fund, the Fund may\nbe subject to a discretionary liquidity fee of\nup to 2% on all redemptions. Discretionary\nliquidity fees may be imposed or terminated at\nany time at the discretion of the board of\ndirectors of the money market fund, or its\ndelegate, if it is determined that such fee\nwould be, or would not be, respectively, in\nthe best interest of the money market fund.\nAdditionally, the Fund will be subject to a\nmandatory liquidity fee if the money market\nfund\u2019s total net redemptions on a single day\nexceed 5% of the money market fund\u2019s net\nassets, unless the liquidity costs are de\nminimis ( i.e ., less than one basis point\n(0.01%)). The money market fund will determine\nthe size of the mandatory liquidity fee by\nmaking a good faith estimate of certain costs\nthe money market fund would incur if it were\nto sell a pro rata amount of each security in\nthe portfolio to satisfy the amount of net\nredemptions on that day. There is no limit to\nthe size of a mandatory liquidity fee. If the\nmoney market fund cannot estimate the costs of\nselling a pro rata amount of each portfolio\nsecurity in good faith and supported by data,\nit is required to apply a default liquidity\nfee of 1% on the value of shares redeemed on\nthat day. The imposition of any such\ndiscretionary or mandatory liquidity fee would\nreduce the Fund\u2019s returns on securities\nlending. Under the securities lending program,\nfunds are categorized into one of several\nspecific asset classes. The determination of a\nfund\u2019s asset class category (fixed-income,\ndomestic equity, international equity or fund-\nof-funds), each of which may be subject to a\ndifferent fee arrangement, is based on a\nmethodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.\nPursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement:\n\n49\n\n(i) domestic equity funds retain 81% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) and this amount\ncan never be less than 70% of the sum of\nsecurities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees; (ii) international equity\nfunds retain 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand this amount can never be less than 70% of\nthe sum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees; (iii) fixed-income\nfunds retain 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand this amount can never be less than 70% of\nthe sum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees; and (iv) fund-of-\nfunds retain 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand this amount can never be less than 70% of\nthe sum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the \u201c\nManagement\u2014Trustees and Officers section of\nthis SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, pursuant to the current\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement: (i) each\napplicable domestic equity fund will receive\n84% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees) for the\nremainder of that calendar year and this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof the securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees; (ii) each\napplicable international equity fund will\nreceive 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nfor the remainder of that calendar year and\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees; (iii) each\napplicable fixed-income fund will receive 85%\nof securities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) for the remainder\nof that calendar year and this amount can\nnever be less than 70% of the sum of\nsecurities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees; and (iv) each applicable\nfund-of-funds will receive 85% of securities\nlending income (which excludes collateral\ninvestment fees) for the remainder of that\ncalendar year and this amount can never be\nless than 70% of the sum of securities lending\nincome plus collateral investment fees.\nBecause the Fund is newly launched, no\nservices have been provided by BTC as the\nFund's securities lending agent, and the Fund\nhad no income and fees/compensation related to\nsecurities lending activities for the fiscal\nyear ended July 31, 2024. Payments by BFA and\nits Affiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates\n(\u201cBFA Entities \u201d ) pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund and other funds or\nproducts sponsored and/or advised by BFA\nEntities (collectively for purposes of this\nsection, the \u201c Products \u201d ). BFA Entities make\nthese payments from their own assets and not\nfrom the assets of the Fund. Although a\nportion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue comes\ndirectly or indirectly in part from fees paid\nby the Fund or other Products (including, if\napplicable, any underlying Products held by\nthe Fund), these payments do not increase the\nprice paid by investors for the purchase of\nshares of, or the cost of owning, the Fund or\nother Products. BFA Entities make payments for\nIntermediaries\u2019 participation in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors more knowledgeable about\nexchange-traded products, including the Fund\nand other Products, or for other activities,\nsuch as participation in marketing activities\nand presentations, educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems ( \u201c\nEducation Costs \u201d ). BFA Entities also make\npayments to Intermediaries for certain\nprinting, publishing and mailing costs or\nmaterials relating to the Fund or other\nProducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Fund or\nother Products available to their clients, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, develop new products\nthat feature iShares, create educational\ncontent about the Fund or other Products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund or other Products.\nBFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or\nmake payments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or other Products.\nPayments of the type described above are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. Payments to an Intermediary may be\nsignificant to the Intermediary, and amounts\nthat Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or\nother investment professional may also be\nsignificant for your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional.\n\n50\n\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund or other Products or\notherwise promote the Fund or other Products\nover other investments. The same conflicts of\ninterest and financial incentives exist with\nrespect to your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional if he or she receives\nsimilar payments from his or her Intermediary\nfirm. In addition to the payments described\nabove, BFA Entities have developed proprietary\ntools, calculators and related interactive or\ndigital content that is made available through\nthe www.blackrock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund or other\nProducts. As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities\nhave contractual arrangements to make payments\n(in addition to payments for Education Costs\nor Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary,\nFidelity Brokerage Services LLC ( \u201c FBS \u201d ).\nEffective June 4, 2016, this relationship was\nexpanded to include National Financial\nServices, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an affiliate of\nFBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and\nsignificant arrangement (the \u201c Marketing\nProgram \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of their\naffiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d ) have\nagreed, among other things, to actively\npromote certain funds and Products to\ncustomers, investment professionals and other\nintermediaries and in advertising campaigns as\nthe preferred exchange-traded product, to\noffer certain funds and Products in certain\nFidelity platforms and investment programs, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, and to provide\nmarketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities\nhave agreed to facilitate the Marketing\nProgram by, among other things, making certain\npayments to FBS and NFS for marketing and\nimplementing certain brokerage and investment\nprograms. Upon termination of the arrangement,\nthe BFA Entities will make additional payments\nto FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of\ncriteria, including the overall success of the\nMarketing Program and the level of services\nprovided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down\nperiod. In addition, BFA Entities have entered\ninto other contractual arrangements with\nIntermediaries and certain other third parties\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or certain Products.\nSuch agreements can include payments by BFA\nEntities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. In certain cases, such\npayments to Intermediaries are subject to\ncertain minimum payment levels or tiered\npayments. With respect to certain funds and\nProducts, payments by the BFA Entities may\ntake the form of, among other things, \u201c due\ndiligence \u201d payments for an Intermediary\u2019s\nreview of such funds and Products; payment for\nproviding employee training and information\nrelating to such funds and Products; fees for\naccess (in some cases on a preferential basis)\nto an Intermediary\u2019s registered\nrepresentatives, salespersons or other\npersonnel, fees for maintaining an\nIntermediary\u2019s investor platform, \u201c shelf\nspace \u201d payments for making such funds and\nProducts available on the Intermediary\u2019s\nplatform or fees for providing assistance in\npromoting the sale of such funds and Products.\nIn such cases, the payments to Intermediaries\nmay be tiered or based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the funds and Products held by\ncustomers of the applicable Intermediary and\nmay also be subject to minimum payment levels.\nPayments made pursuant to such arrangements\nmay vary in any year and may be different for\ndifferent Intermediaries and third parties and\nmay reflect different services provided. As of\nthe date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and\nother third parties (or their respective\naffiliates) receiving one or more types of the\ncontractual payments described above include\n(in addition to FBS and NFS): &Partners,\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, AE Wealth Management,\nLLC, American Enterprise Investment Services,\nInc., Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY\nMellon Capital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon\nPerformance & Risk Analytics, LLC, Cetera\nFinancial Group, Inc., Charles Schwab & Co.,\nInc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, Commonwealth\nEquity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and\nAssociates, LLC, Dynasty Financial Partners\nLLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., Interactive Brokers LLC, LPL\nFinancial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Incorporated, MML Investors Services,\nLLC, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,\nNorthwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC,\nOrion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC,\nRaymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nTD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services\nInc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and\nWells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC.\nAny additions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\nProducts,\n\n51\n\nincluding the Fund, in a year or other period,\nany of which arrangements may include an\nagreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. Please contact\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments or financial incentives his\nor her Intermediary firm may receive. Any\npayments made, or financial incentives\noffered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund or other Products. The Fund\nmay participate in certain market maker\nincentive programs of a national securities\nexchange in which an affiliate of the Fund\nwould pay a fee to the exchange used for the\npurpose of incentivizing one or more market\nmakers in the securities of the Fund to\nenhance the liquidity and quality of the\nsecondary market of securities of the Fund.\nThe fee would then be credited by the exchange\nto one or more market makers that meet or\nexceed liquidity and market quality standards\nwith respect to the securities of the Fund.\nEach market maker incentive program is subject\nto approval from the SEC. Any such fee\npayments made to an exchange will be made by\nan affiliate of the Fund solely for the\nbenefit of the Fund and will not be paid from\nany Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA\nmay also participate in such programs.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value Valuation of\nShares. The NAV for the Fund is generally\ncalculated as of the close of regular trading\nhours on the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each\nbusiness day the NYSE is open. Valuation of\nassets held by the Fund is as follows: Equity\nInvestments. Equity securities traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE),\non separate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by the Fund on a day on which\nthe Fund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser\n\n52\n\nthan expected gain upon the sale of the\ninvestment. A Fund\u2019s ability to value its\ninvestment may also be impacted by\ntechnological issues and/or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. All cash, receivables and current\npayables are carried on the Fund\u2019s books at\ntheir fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial\n\n53\n\nAccounting Standards Board Accounting\nStandards Codification Topic 820, \u201c Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c ASC 820 \u201d\n), which defines and establishes a framework\nfor measuring fair value under US GAAP and\nexpands financial statement disclosure\nrequirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Fund will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor execution could be obtained by using a\nbroker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the\n\n54\n\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts, the Fund will not deal with\naffiliated persons and affiliated persons of\nsuch affiliated persons in connection with\nsuch transactions. The Fund will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Fund are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Fund does not currently expect to incur\nany brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother\n\n55\n\nAffiliates during the same period increase the\ndemand for securities being purchased or the\nsupply of securities being sold, there may be\nan adverse effect on price. For example, sales\nof a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or\nmore of its clients may decrease the market\nprice of such security, adversely impacting\nother BlackRock clients that still hold the\nsecurity. If purchases or sales of securities\narise for consideration at or about the same\ntime that would involve the Fund or other\nclients or funds for which BFA or another\nAffiliate act as investment manager,\ntransactions in such securities will be made,\ninsofar as feasible, for the respective funds\nand clients in a manner deemed equitable to\nall. In certain instances, BFA may find it\nefficient for purposes of seeking to obtain\nbest execution, to aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d\ncertain contemporaneous purchases or sale\norders of its advisory accounts and advisory\naccounts of affiliates. In general, all\ncontemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund are concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940\n\n56\n\nAct. All shares (regardless of the fund) have\nnoncumulative voting rights in the election of\nmembers of the Board. Under Delaware law,\nTrustees of the Trust may be removed by vote\nof the shareholders. Following the creation of\nthe initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a\nfund and immediately prior to the commencement\nof trading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC\n\n57\n\nParticipant. The Trust shall provide each such\nDTC Participant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant a fair and\nreasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange or the listing\nexchange for the Fund\u2019s exchange-traded\noptions close earlier than normal, the Fund\nmay require orders to be placed earlier in the\nday. The following table sets forth the number\nof shares of the Fund that constitute a\nCreation Unit for the Fund and the approximate\nvalue of such Creation Unit as of December 30,\n2024:\n\n58\n                                              \n  Shares PerCreation        ApproximateValue  \n  Unit                       PerCreationUnit  \n                                     (U.S.$)  \n  40,000                          $1,000,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year\u2019s Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which will be applicable (subject\nto possible amendment or correction) to\ncreation requests received in proper form. The\nFund Deposit represents the minimum initial\nand subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of the Fund until such time as\nthe next-announced Fund Deposit is made\navailable. The Cash Component is an amount\nequal to the difference between the NAV of the\nshares (per Creation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit\nAmount, \u201d which is an amount equal to the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities, and\nserves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit. The Fund generally offers\nCreation Units partially for cash, but may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer Creation Units\nsolely for cash or solely in-kind. Please see\nthe Cash Purchase Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the Deposit\nSecurity method for further information on\npurchasing Creation Units of the Fund. The\nidentity and number or par value of the\nDeposit Securities change pursuant to changes\nin the composition of the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nas rebalancing adjustments and corporate\naction events are reflected from time to time\nby BFA with a view to the investment objective\nof the Fund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nFund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, substitute a\n\u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations.\n\n59\n\nCash Purchase Method. Although the Fund does\nnot generally permit full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified (Creation Units of the\nFund are generally offered partially for\ncash), they will be effected in essentially\nthe same manner as in-kind purchases thereof.\nIn the case of a partial or full cash\npurchase, the Authorized Participant must pay\nthe cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities\nit would otherwise be required to provide\nthrough an in-kind purchase, plus the same\nCash Component required to be paid by an in-\nkind purchaser. Procedures for Creation of\nCreation Units. To be eligible to place orders\nwith the Distributor and to create a Creation\nUnit of the Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Such Authorized Participant\nwill agree, pursuant to the terms of such\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and on behalf\nof itself or any investor on whose behalf it\nwill act, to certain conditions, including\nthat such Authorized Participant will make\navailable in advance of each purchase of\nshares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component, once the NAV of a Creation\nUnit is next determined after receipt of the\npurchase order in proper form, together with\nthe transaction fees described below. An\nAuthorized Participant, acting on behalf of an\ninvestor, may require the investor to enter\ninto an agreement with such Authorized\nParticipant with respect to certain matters,\nincluding payment of the Cash Component.\nInvestors who are not Authorized Participants\nmust make appropriate arrangements with an\nAuthorized Participant. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not be\na DTC Participant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor\u2019s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Placement of Creation Orders. Fund\nDeposits must be delivered through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), through DTC (for corporate and\nmunicipal securities) or through a central\ndepository account, such as with Euroclear or\nDTC, maintained by BNY Mellon or a sub-\ncustodian (a \u201c Central Depository Account \u201d ).\nAny portion of the Fund Deposit that may not\nbe delivered through the Federal Reserve\nSystem or DTC must be delivered through a\nCentral Depository Account. The Fund Deposit\ntransfers made through DTC must be ordered by\nthe DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as\nto ensure the delivery of the requisite number\nof Deposit Securities through DTC to the\naccount of the Fund generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.\nFund Deposit transfers made through the\nFederal Reserve System must be deposited by\nthe participant institution in a timely\nfashion so as to ensure the delivery of the\nrequisite number or amount of Deposit\nSecurities or cash through the Federal Reserve\nSystem to the account of the Fund generally\nbefore 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the\nSettlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made\nthrough a Central Depository Account must be\ncompleted pursuant to the requirements\nestablished by the custodian or sub-custodian\nfor such Central Depository Account generally\nbefore 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the\nSettlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d for\nall funds is generally the first business day\nafter the Transmittal Date. All questions as\nto the number of Deposit Securities to be\ndelivered, and the validity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for\nthe deposit of any tendered securities, will\nbe determined by the Trust, whose\ndetermination shall be final and binding. The\namount of cash equal to the Cash Component\nmust be transferred directly to BNY Mellon\nthrough the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer\nsystem in a timely manner so as to be received\nby BNY Mellon generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. If the\nCash Component and the Deposit Securities are\nnot received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the\nSettlement Date, the creation order may be\ncanceled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using\nthe Fund Deposit as newly\n\n60\n\nconstituted to reflect the then current NAV of\nthe Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so\ncreated generally will occur no later than the\nfirst Business Day following the day on which\nthe purchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor, provided that the relevant Fund\nDeposit has been received by the Fund prior to\nsuch time. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of the Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any\nBusiness Day in order to receive that day\u2019s\nNAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant in the form required by\nthe Fund to the Distributor or its agent\npursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. The Fund\u2019s\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund\u2019s \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor\u2019s or its\nagent\u2019s proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund\u2019s Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor\u2019s behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund\u2019s right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized\n\n61\n\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Fund, BNY\nMellon, the sub-custodian and the Distributor\nor its agent are under no duty, however, to\ngive notification of any defects or\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the Fund of the Deposit Securities\nand the payment of the Cash Component have\nbeen completed. When the sub-custodian has\nconfirmed to the custodian that the securities\nincluded in the Fund Deposit (or the cash\nvalue thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-\ncustodians, the Distributor or its agent and\nBFA shall be notified of such delivery and a\nFund will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Unit. Creation Units are generally\nissued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e ., one\nBusiness Day after trade date). However, the\nFund reserves the right to settle Creation\nUnit transactions on a different basis, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (\ni.e ., the last day the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security). To the\nextent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\nthe Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Fund. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund\u2019s current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by such\nFund and the Fund\u2019s determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each creation\norder, which consists of (1) a fee for\nproviding the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs charged by the\nFund custodian in connection with the issuance\nof Creation Units for such creation order ( \u201c\nCustody Transaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund\u2019s Creation Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets and settlement\nlocations associated with the issuance of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth,\nfor the Fund, either the actual creation\ntransaction fee that was charged on December\n16, 2024 or an estimate of the creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nif the Fund had issued a Creation Unit on that\ndate. The actual fee that was or would have\nbeen charged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses for the Fund and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread\n\n62\n\nbetween the expected bid and offer side of the\nmarket and anticipated market impact).\nHowever, the Fund is not obligated to trade\nidentical securities to the securities\nidentified by BlackRock in estimating these\ntransaction and other costs and expenses. In\ncertain cases, BlackRock or an affiliate may\ndetermine in its discretion to deviate from\nthe regular charge, subject to the maximum\namounts shown below. Authorized Participants\nwill also bear the costs of transferring the\nDeposit Securities to the Fund. Certain\nfees/costs associated with creation\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund\u2019s estimated creation transaction fee\nas of December 16, 2024 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge for  \n  Fee                   Creations*            \n  $0**                  3.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. ** Estimated fee Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of the Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Fund will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units partially for\ncash. However, the Fund reserves the right to\ndistribute securities and other portfolio\ninstruments in-kind as payment for Creation\nUnits being redeemed. Please see the Cash\nRedemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Fund. The Fund publishes\nthe designated portfolio of securities\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) that will be\napplicable to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nFund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ),\nand an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) are applicable, in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of the\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. If redemptions are\nnot paid in cash, the redemption proceeds for\na Creation Unit generally consist of Fund\nSecurities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an\namount equal to the difference between the net\nasset value of the shares being redeemed, as\nnext determined after the receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form, and the\nvalue of Fund Securities, less a redemption\ntransaction fee (as described below). The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to replace any Fund\nSecurity in certain circumstances, including:\n(i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to\nthe Authorized Participant (or to an investor\non whose behalf the Authorized Participant is\nacting) would be restricted under applicable\nsecurities or other local laws or due to a\ntrading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of\na Fund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the disposition of the Fund\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units partially for cash. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant\n\n63\n\na portfolio of securities that differs from\nthe exact composition of the Fund Securities,\nbut does not differ in NAV. The Redemption\nBasket may also be modified to minimize the\nCash Component by redistributing the cash to\nthe Fund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified (\ne.g ., Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally redeemed partially for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the\ncase of partial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities it would\notherwise receive through an in-kind\nredemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be\npaid to an in-kind redeemer. Costs Associated\nwith Redemption Transactions. A standard\nredemption transaction fee is imposed to\noffset transfer and other transaction costs\nthat may be incurred by the Fund. As described\nabove, under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each redemption\norder, which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing\nFee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\nthe Fund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets, and settlement\nlocations associated with the redemption of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth,\nfor the Fund, either the actual standard\nredemption transaction fee that was charged on\nDecember 16, 2024 or an estimate of the\nstandard redemption transaction fee that would\nhave been charged if the Fund had redeemed a\nCreation Unit on that date. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. In order\nto defray transaction expenses for the Fund\nand protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a redemption transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, the\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\nthe Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund\u2019s estimated redemption\ntransaction fee as of December 16, 2024 and\nmaximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge for  \n  Fee                   Redemptions*          \n  $301.25**             2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. ** Estimated fee.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day, in order to receive that\nday\u2019s NAV. On days\n\n64\n\nwhen the Listing Exchange closes earlier than\nnormal, the Fund may require orders to redeem\nCreation Units to be placed earlier that day.\nInvestors, other than Authorized Participants,\nare responsible for making arrangements for a\nredemption request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. The\nAuthorized Participant must transmit the\nrequest for redemption in the form required by\nthe Fund to the Distributor or its agent in\naccordance with procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nshould be aware that their particular broker\nmay not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\nrequests to redeem Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor\u2019s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant who has executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund\u2019s transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund\u2019s\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to a Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund\u2019s transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor\u2019s shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within one\nBusiness Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). However, the\nFund reserves the right to settle deliveries\nof redemption proceeds on a different basis,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and dividend ex-dates\n(i.e ., the last date the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security). If the\nFund includes a foreign investment in its\nbasket, and if a local market holiday, or\nseries of consecutive holidays, or the\nextended delivery cycles for transferring\nforeign investments to redeeming Authorized\nParticipants prevents timely delivery of the\nforeign investment in response to a redemption\nrequest, the Fund may delay delivery of the\nforeign investment more than seven days if the\nFund delivers the foreign investment as soon\nas practicable, but in no event later than 15\ndays. If neither the Authorized Participant\nnor the Beneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund\u2019s brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws.\n\n65\n\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant\u2019s agreement with the Distributor\nor its agent, in the event an Authorized\nParticipant has submitted a redemption request\nin proper form but is unable to transfer all\nor part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to\nthe Fund, at or prior to the time specified by\nthe Fund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of redemption\nrequest, the Distributor or its agent will\naccept the redemption request in reliance on\nthe undertaking by the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby BNY Mellon and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of BNY Mellon and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. The right of redemption may\nbe suspended or the date of payment postponed\nwith respect to the Fund: (i) for any period\nduring which the Listing Exchange is closed\n(other than customary weekend and holiday\nclosings); (ii) for any period during which\ntrading on the Listing Exchange is suspended\nor restricted; (iii) for any period during\nwhich an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund will accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for a Fund, as set forth in the\nFund\u2019s policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. References to the Fund\nwill also generally apply to the Underlying\nFund as well.\n\n66\n\nRegulated Investment Company Qualifications.\nThe Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a\nseparate RIC under Subchapter M of the\nInternal Revenue Code. To qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, the Fund must annually\ndistribute at least 90% of its investment\ncompany taxable income (which includes\ndividends, interest and net short-term capital\ngains) and meet several other requirements.\nAmong such other requirements are the\nfollowing: (i) at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s\nannual gross income must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock or securities or non-U.S.\ncurrencies, other income (including, but not\nlimited to, gains from options, futures or\nforward contracts) derived with respect to its\nbusiness of investing in such stock,\nsecurities or currencies, and net income\nderived from interests in qualified publicly-\ntraded partnerships ( i.e., partnerships that\nare traded on an established securities market\nor tradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. The Fund will be subject to\nincome tax at regular corporate rates on any\ntaxable income or gains that it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders. If the Fund\nfails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC\nor fails to meet the distribution requirement,\nall of its taxable income will be subject to\ntax at regular corporate income tax rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and such distributions generally\nwill be taxable to shareholders as ordinary\ndividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends\n\n67\n\nto declare and distribute dividends and\ndistributions in the amounts and at the times\nnecessary to avoid the application of this 4%\nexcise tax. Long-term capital distributions\nfrom the Underlying Fund paid in December or,\nin certain cases, January in satisfaction of\nthis rule will be subject to potential\ndistribution by the Fund in the following\ncalendar year. Net Capital Loss Carryforwards.\nNet capital loss carryforwards may be applied\nagainst any net realized capital gains in each\nsucceeding year, until they have been reduced\nto zero. In the event that the Fund were to\nexperience an ownership change as defined\nunder the Internal Revenue Code, the loss\ncarryforwards and other favorable tax\nattributes of the Fund, if any, may be subject\nto limitation. Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.\nDividends and other distributions by the Fund\nare generally treated under the Internal\nRevenue Code as received by the shareholders\nat the time the dividend or distribution is\nmade. However, any dividend or distribution\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember of any calendar year and payable to\nshareholders of record on a specified date in\nsuch a month shall be deemed to have been\nreceived by each shareholder on December 31 of\nsuch calendar year and to have been paid by\nthe Fund not later than such December 31,\nprovided such dividend is actually paid by the\nFund during January of the following calendar\nyear. The Fund intends to distribute annually\nto its shareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Because the\nFund is expected to invest in an Underlying\nFund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses on sales of\nshares of the Underlying Fund may be\nindefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Distributions of short-term capital\ngains by the Underlying Fund will be\nrecognized as ordinary income by the Fund and\nwould not be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund. Long-term capital gains are eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for\nnon-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts. If an individual receives a regular\ndividend qualifying for the long-term capital\ngains rates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be\n\n68\n\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas receiving a distribution in an amount equal\nto the amount of money that the shareholders\nreceiving cash dividends or distributions will\nreceive and should have a cost basis in the\nshares received equal to such amount. A 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on net investment income, including,\nbut not limited to, interest, dividends, and\nnet gain from investments, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Investors considering buying shares\njust prior to a dividend or capital gain\ndistribution should be aware that, although\nthe price of shares purchased at that time may\nreflect the amount of the forthcoming\ndistribution, such dividend or distribution\nmay nevertheless be taxable to them. If the\nFund is the holder of record of any security\non the record date for any dividends payable\nwith respect to such security, such dividends\nwill be included in the Fund\u2019s gross income\nnot as of the date received but as of the\nlater of (a) the date such security became ex-\ndividend with respect to such dividends ( i.e.\n, the date on which a buyer of the security\nwould not be entitled to receive the declared,\nbut unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the\nFund acquired such security. Accordingly, in\norder to satisfy its income distribution\nrequirements, the Fund may be required to pay\ndividends based on anticipated earnings, and\nshareholders may receive dividends in an\nearlier year than would otherwise be the case.\nIn certain situations, the Fund may, for a\ntaxable year, defer all or a portion of its\nnet capital loss (or if there is no net\ncapital loss, then any net long-term or short-\nterm capital loss) realized after October and\nits late-year ordinary loss (defined as the\nsum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions. Sales\nof Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of shares\nof the Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by the Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an\norder for a purchase of shares of the Fund if\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have\na basis in the\n\n69\n\nsecurities different from the market value of\nsuch securities on the date of deposit. If the\nFund\u2019s basis in such securities on the date of\ndeposit was less than market value on such\ndate, the Fund, upon disposition of the\nsecurities, would recognize more taxable gain\nor less taxable loss than if its basis in the\nsecurities had been equal to market value. It\nis not anticipated that the Trust will\nexercise the right of rejection except in a\ncase where the Trust determines that accepting\nthe order could result in material adverse tax\nconsequences to the Fund or its shareholders.\nThe Trust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. Treatment of Options. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in offsetting positions with\nrespect to an Underlying Fund may be \u201c\nstraddles \u201d ( i.e ., offsetting positions with\nrespect to personal property) for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. The straddle rules may\naffect the character of gains (or losses)\nrealized by a Fund, and losses realized by a\nFund on positions that are part of a straddle\nmay be deferred under the straddle rules,\nrather than being taken into account in\ncalculating taxable income for the taxable\nyear in which the losses are realized. In\naddition, certain carrying charges (including\ninterest expense) associated with positions in\na straddle may be required to be capitalized\nrather than deducted currently. Certain\nelections that a Fund may make with respect to\nits straddle positions may also affect the\namount, character and timing of the\nrecognition of gains or losses from the\naffected positions. The tax consequences of\nstraddle transactions to a Fund are not\nentirely clear in all situations under\ncurrently available authority. The straddle\nrules may increase the amount of short-term\ncapital gains realized by a Fund, which are\ntaxed as ordinary income when distributed to\nU.S. shareholders in a non-liquidating\ndistribution. Because the application of the\nstraddle rules may affect the character of\ngains or losses, defer losses and/or\naccelerate the recognition of gains or losses\nfrom the affected straddle positions, if a\nFund makes a non-liquidating distribution of\nits short-term capital gains, the amount that\nU.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be substantially greater or less as\ncompared to a fund that did not engage in such\ntransactions. Under Section 1256 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, certain types of\nexchange-traded options are treated as if they\nwere sold ( i.e ., \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at\nthe end of each year. The Fund does not\nbelieve that the positions held by the Fund\nwill be subject to Section 1256, which means\nthat the positions will not be marked to\nmarket, but the positions will be subject to\nthe straddle rules. Taxation of Certain\nDerivatives. The Fund\u2019s transactions in zero\ncoupon securities, non-U.S. currencies,\nforward contracts, options and futures\ncontracts (including options and futures\ncontracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the\nextent permitted, will be subject to special\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to \u201c hedging\ntransactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d ) that, among\nother consequences, may affect the character\nof gains and losses realized by the Fund ( i.e\n., may affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.\nThese rules could therefore affect the\ncharacter, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also (a)\nwill require the Fund to mark-to-market\ncertain types of the positions in its\nportfolio (i.e ., treat them as if they were\nclosed out at the end of each year) and (b)\nmay cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to pay dividends or\nmake distributions in amounts necessary to\nsatisfy the distribution requirements for\navoiding income and excise taxes. The Fund\nwill monitor its transactions, will make the\nappropriate tax elections and will make the\nappropriate entries in its books and records\nwhen it acquires any zero coupon security,\nnon-U.S. currency, forward contract, option,\nfutures contract or hedged investment in order\nto mitigate the effect of these rules and\nprevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c section\n1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All section 1256\ncontracts held by the Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, the Fund may\nmake or receive periodic net payments. The\nFund may also make or receive a payment when a\nswap is terminated prior to maturity through\nan assignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\n\n70\n\nfor more than one year). The cost of any\npayments made by the Fund on a swap\ntransaction will be netted pro rata against\nboth tax exempt and taxable gross income. With\nrespect to certain types of swaps, the Fund\nmay be required to currently recognize income\nor loss with respect to future payments on\nsuch swaps or may elect under certain\ncircumstances to mark such swaps to market\nannually for tax purposes as ordinary income\nor loss. Qualified Dividend Income.\nDistributions by the Fund of investment\ncompany taxable income (including any short-\nterm capital gains), whether received in cash\nor shares, will be taxable either as ordinary\nincome or as qualified dividend income, which\nis eligible to be taxed at long-term capital\ngain rates to the extent the Fund receives\nqualified dividend income on the securities it\nholds and the Fund reports the distribution as\nqualified dividend income. The Fund does not\nexpect that a significant portion of its\ndistributions will consist of qualified\ndividend income or be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Qualified\ndividend income is, in general, dividend\nincome from taxable U.S. corporations (but\ngenerally not from U.S. REITs) and certain\nnon-U.S. corporations ( e.g. , non-U.S.\ncorporations that are not PFICs and which are\nincorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in\ncertain countries with a comprehensive tax\ntreaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is\nreadily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the U.S. (where the dividends are\npaid with respect to such stock)). Under\ncurrent IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate\ncomprehensive income tax treaties with the\nfollowing countries: Australia, Austria,\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,\nCanada, Chile, China (but not with Hong Kong,\nwhich is treated as a separate jurisdiction\nfor U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech\nRepublic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India,\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nthe Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa,\nSouth Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by the\nFund for securities lent out by the Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom the Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or the Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from the Underlying Funds and that\nare attributable to dividends paid by U.S.\ncorporations may qualify for the U.S. federal\ndividends received deduction for corporations.\nA 46-day minimum holding period during the\n90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-\ndividend date (or 91-day minimum holding\nperiod during the 180 period beginning 90 days\nprior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at the Fund level, the\nUnderlying Fund level and shareholder level,\nfor a dividend to be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Restrictions may\napply if indebtedness, including a short sale,\nis attributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by the\nUnderlying Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt\n\n71\n\nsuch as individual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund or Underlying Fund to\nbe subject to tax if certain \u201c disqualified\norganizations, \u201d as defined by the Internal\nRevenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a\ncharitable remainder annuity trust or a\ncharitable remainder unitrust (each as defined\nin Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code)\nhas UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax\non the UBTI is imposed on the trust. The Fund\ntries to avoid investing in REITs that are\nexpected to generate excess inclusion income,\nbut the Fund may not always be successful in\ndoing so. Because information about a REIT\u2019s\ninvestments may be inadequate or inaccurate,\nor because a REIT may change its investment\nprogram, the Fund may not be successful in\navoiding the consequences described above.\nAvoidance of investments in REITs that\ngenerate excess inclusion income may require\nthe Fund to forego otherwise attractive\ninvestment opportunities. Reporting. If a\nshareholder recognizes a loss with respect to\nthe Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for an\nindividual shareholder or $10 million or more\nfor a corporate shareholder, the shareholder\nmust file with the IRS a disclosure statement\non IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of\nportfolio securities are in many cases\nexempted from this reporting requirement, but\nunder current guidance, shareholders of a RIC\nare not exempted. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. Other Taxes. Dividends,\ndistributions and redemption proceeds may also\nbe subject to additional state, local and\nnon-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder\u2019s\nparticular situation. Taxation of Non-U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends paid by the Fund to\nnon-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to\nwithholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced\nrate specified by an applicable income tax\ntreaty to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gains. Dividends\npaid by the Fund from net tax-exempt income or\nlong-term capital gains are generally not\nsubject to such withholding tax. In order to\nobtain a reduced rate of withholding, a\nnon-U.S. shareholder will be required to\nprovide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to\nbenefits under a treaty. The withholding tax\ndoes not apply to regular dividends paid to a\nnon-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form\nW-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are\neffectively connected with the non-U.S.\nshareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. Instead, the effectively\nconnected dividends will be subject to regular\nU.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder\nwere a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S.\ncorporation receiving effectively connected\ndividends may also be subject to additional \u201c\nbranch profits tax \u201d imposed at a rate of 30%\n(or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS\nForm W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be\nsubject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Properly-reported dividends\nare generally exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax where they (i) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net interest\nincome \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S. source\ninterest income, other than certain contingent\ninterest and interest from obligations of a\ncorporation or partnership in which the Fund\nis at least a 10% shareholder or partner,\nreduced by expenses that are allocable to such\nincome) or (ii) are paid in respect of the\nFund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term capital gains \u201d\n(generally, the excess of the Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gain over the Fund\u2019s long-\nterm capital loss for such taxable year).\nHowever, depending on its circumstances, the\nFund may report all, some or none of its\npotentially eligible dividends as such\nqualified net interest income or as qualified\nshort-term capital gains and/or treat such\ndividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible\nfor this exemption from withholding. In order\nto qualify for this exemption from\nwithholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need\nto comply with applicable certification\nrequirements relating to its non-U.S. status\n(including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form).\nIn the case of shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving the Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as\n\n72\n\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. A foreign\nshareholder also may be subject to certain \u201c\nwash sale \u201d rules to prevent the avoidance of\nthe tax filing and payment obligations\ndiscussed above through the sale and\nrepurchase of Fund shares. Shareholders that\nare nonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of the Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax.

Policy / Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of\ncertain open-end funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d )\nadvised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or\nBlackRock Advisors, LLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ),\nhave the responsibility for the oversight of\nvoting proxies relating to portfolio\nsecurities of the Funds, and have determined\nthat it is in the best interests of the Funds\nand their shareholders to delegate the\nresponsibility to vote proxies to BlackRock,\nsubject to the principles outlined in this\nPolicy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s authority to\nmanage, acquire and dispose of account assets,\nall as contemplated by the Funds\u2019 respective\ninvestment management agreements. BlackRock\nhas adopted the BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship Global Engagement and Voting\nGuidelines (as from time to time amended, the\n\u201c Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\nactive and fixed income index Funds managed by\nBlackRock. The Guidelines include \u201c climate\nand decarbonization \u201d guidelines which apply\nto the Funds listed in Appendix A, if any.\nBlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of\nthe Funds covered by this policy on specific\nproxy issues in respect of securities held by\neach such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Guidelines. Conflicts\nManagement BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BAIS \u201d ) maintains policies\nand procedures that seek to prevent undue\ninfluence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting activity\nand to mitigate material conflicts of interest\nin the exercise of proxy voting\nresponsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in the Guidelines. In\nmitigating conflicts, BAIS will adhere to the\nGuidelines. In certain instances, BAIS will\nengage an independent third-party voting\nservice provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations as a further safeguard to\navoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw.\n\nA-2\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and BlackRock may\ndetermine to recall them for voting, as guided\nby BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to act\nin clients\u2019 financial interests. The\nGuidelines set forth BlackRock\u2019s approach to\nrecalling securities on loan in connection\nwith proxy voting. Reports to the Board\nBlackRock will report on an annual basis to\nthe Directors on (1) a summary of the proxy\nvoting process as applicable to the Funds\ncovered by this policy in the preceding year\ntogether with a representation that all votes\nwere in accordance with the Guidelines and (2)\nany material changes to the Guidelines,\nincluding material changes to conflicts\nmanagement practices, that have not previously\nbeen reported.

BAIS works in partnership with\nBlackRock\u2019s investment teams, excluding index\nequity, providing expertise on investment\nstewardship, engaging with companies on behalf\nof those teams when appropriate, and assisting\nin recommending, operationalizing and\nreporting on voting decisions. The guidance\ninforms BAIS\u2019 voting recommendations to\nBlackRock\u2019s active portfolio managers. It\napplies to active equity holdings in\nBlackRock\u2019s fundamental equity, systematic\nequity and multi-asset solutions strategies.\nIt also may apply to holdings in BlackRock\u2019s\nindex and active fixed income strategies, to\nthe extent those strategies hold voting\nsecurities or conduct issuer engagements. The\nguidelines are not prescriptive as active\nportfolio managers have discretion as to how\nthey integrate these guidelines within their\ninvestment processes in light of their\nclients\u2019 or funds\u2019 investment objectives.\nThere are separate, independently developed\nprinciples and voting policies that are\napplied to BlackRock\u2019s index equity\ninvestments by a distinct and independent\nfunction, BlackRock Investment Stewardship.\nIntroduction to BlackRock BlackRock\u2019s purpose\nis to help more and more people experience\nfinancial well-being. We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world.\n\nA-4\n\nAbout BlackRock Active Investment Stewardship\nBlackRock Active Investment Stewardship (BAIS)\nis a specialist team within the Portfolio\nManagement Group and manages BlackRock\u2019s\nstewardship engagement and voting on behalf of\nclients invested in active strategies\nglobally. BAIS is also responsible for\nengagement with issuers in index fixed income\nstrategies, where appropriate. Our activities\nare informed by these Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines ( \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) and\ninsights from active investment analysts and\nportfolio managers, with whom we work closely\nin engaging companies and voting at\nshareholder meetings. Engagement with public\ncompanies is the foundation of our approach to\nstewardship within fundamental active\ninvesting. Through direct dialogue with\ncompany leadership, we seek to understand\ntheir businesses and how they manage risks and\nopportunities to deliver durable, risk\nadjusted financial returns. Generally,\nportfolio managers and stewardship specialists\nengage jointly on substantive matters. Our\ndiscussions focus on topics relevant to a\ncompany\u2019s success over time including\ngovernance and leadership, corporate strategy,\ncapital structure and financial performance,\noperations and sustainability-related risks,\nas well as macro-economic, geopolitical and\nsector dynamics. We aim to be constructive\ninvestors and are generally supportive of\nmanagement teams that have a track record of\nfinancial value creation. We aim to build and\nmaintain strong relationships with company\nleadership based on open dialogue and mutual\nrespect. Different active equity strategies\nmay implement these voting guidelines\ndifferently, as a result of the latitude the\nportfolio manager has to make independent\nvoting decisions aligned with their portfolio\nobjectives and investment strategy. For\nexample, BAIS will generally vote the holdings\nin Systematic Active Equity portfolios in\naccordance with these guidelines. We provide\nvoting recommendations to fundamental equity\nportfolio managers, who may determine to vote\ndifferently based on their portfolio\ninvestment objectives and strategy. These\nguidelines discuss corporate governance topics\non which we may engage with management teams\nand board directors (1) and matters that\nroutinely come to a shareholder vote. We\nrecognize that accepted corporate governance\nnorms can differ across markets, and believe\nthese guidelines represent globally applicable\nelements of governance that support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to manage material risks and\nopportunities and deliver financial returns to\ninvestors. Generally, we believe companies\nshould observe accepted corporate governance\nnorms within their local markets or,\nparticularly in markets without well-\nestablished norms, aspire to widely recognized\ninternational best practices. As one of many\nminority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013 and\ndoes not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s strategy\nor its implementation. We look to companies to\nprovide disclosures that explain how their\napproach to corporate governance best aligns\nwith the financial interests of their\ninvestors. Our approach to stewardship within\nactive equities As shareholders of public\ncompanies, BlackRock\u2019s clients have certain\nfundamental rights, including the right to\nvote on proposals put forth by a company\u2019s\nmanagement or its shareholders. The voting\nrights attached to these clients\u2019 holdings are\nan important mechanism for investors to\nexpress support for, or concern about, a\ncompany\u2019s performance. As a fiduciary,\nBlackRock is legally required to make proxy\nvoting determinations, on behalf of clients\nwho have delegated voting authority to us, in\na manner that is consistent with their\ninvestment objectives. In general, we tend to\nsupport the recommendations of the board of\ndirectors and management. As indicated below,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhen we have concerns about how companies are\nserving the financial interests of our clients\nas their shareholders. We take a globally\nconsistent approach to voting but consider the\ndifferent corporate governance regulations and\nnorms in various markets. Votes are determined\non a case-by-case basis, in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s situation and the investment mandate\nwe have from clients. Please see page 16 for\nmore information about how we fulfil and\noversee BlackRock\u2019s non-index equity\ninvestment stewardship responsibilities. Our\napproach to stewardship within fixed income\nAlthough fixed income investors do not have\nthe right to vote at shareholder meetings,\nissuer engagement is a component of fixed\nincome investment strategies at BlackRock,\nparticularly those with sustainability\nobjectives in addition to financial\nobjectives. Most corporate governance-related\nfixed income engagements are undertaken in\nconjunction with the active investment\nstewardship team, and often active equity\ninvestors. In addition to the topics listed\nbelow, engagement with fixed\n\n(1) References to the board, board directors\nor non-executive directors should be\nunderstood to include supervisory boards and\ntheir members, where relevant.\n\nA-5\n\nincome investment teams can help inform an\nissuer\u2019s approach to structuring specialist\nissuances, such as green bonds, and the\nstandard terms and information in bond\ndocumentation. Boards of Directors Roles and\nresponsibilities There is widespread consensus\nthat the foundation of good corporate\ngovernance is an effective board of directors\nthat is able to advise and supervise\nmanagement in an independent and objective\nmanner (2) . We look to the board of directors\n(hereafter \u2018the board\u2019) to have an oversight\nrole in the establishment and realization of a\ncompany\u2019s strategy, purpose and culture. These\nconstructs are interdependent and, when\naligned, can better position a company to be\nresilient in the face of a changing business\nenvironment, help reduce the risks of\ncorporate or employee misconduct, and attract\nand retain the caliber of workers necessary to\ndeliver financial performance over time. In\npromoting the success of the company, the\nboard ensures the necessary resources,\npolicies and procedures are in place to help\nmanagement meet its strategic objectives\nwithin an agreed risk tolerance. One of the\nmost important responsibilities of the board\nis to appoint, and remove as necessary, the\nchief executive officer (CEO). In addition,\nthe board plays a meaningful role in\nmonitoring the performance of the CEO and\nother key executives, determining executive\ncompensation, ensuring a rigorous audit,\noverseeing strategy execution and risk\nmanagement and engaging with shareholders, and\nother stakeholders, as necessary. Composition\nand effectiveness Appointment process A formal\nand transparent process for identifying and\nappointing director candidates is critical to\nensuring the board is composed of directors\nwith the appropriate mix of skills and\nexperience. The board or a sub-committee\nshould determine the general criteria given\nthe company\u2019s circumstances (e.g., sector,\nmaturity, geographic footprint) and any\nadditional criteria for a specific role being\nfilled (e.g., financial expertise, industry\ntrack record). To inform the process, we\nencourage companies to review the skills and\nexperience of incumbent directors to identify\nany gaps and whether a director candidate\u2019s\ncharacteristics would be additive. We welcome\ndisclosures that explain how the board\nconsidered different skills, backgrounds and\nexperience to ensure the directors\ncollectively can be effective in fulfilling\ntheir responsibilities. We assess a company\u2019s\nboard composition against that of its peer\ngroup and local market requirements.\nShareholders periodically vote to elect,\nremove and nominate directors to serve on the\nboard. We may vote against the election of the\nmost senior independent director, or the chair\nof the relevant committee, where a company has\nnot demonstrated it has an appointment process\nthat results in a high functioning board with\nthe appropriate complement of skills,\nbackgrounds and experience amongst the\ndirectors to support strong financial\nperformance over time. We may vote against\nnewly nominated directors who do not seem to\nhave the appropriate skills or experience to\ncontribute to the board\u2019s effectiveness.\nIndependence Director independence from\nmanagement, significant shareholders or other\nstakeholders (e.g., government or employees)\nis of paramount importance to the protection\nof the interests of minority shareholders such\nas BlackRock\u2019s clients. At least half of the\ndirectors should be independent and free from\nconflicts of interest or undue influence (3) .\nThis ensures sufficient independent directors\nto have appropriately independent board\ncommittees. Companies domiciled in markets\nwith a higher threshold for board independence\nshould meet those requirements.\n\n(2) See the Corporate Governance Codes of\nGermany, Japan, and the UK, as well as the\ncorporate governance principles of the US\nBusiness Roundtable as examples. (3) Common\nimpediments to independence may include but\nare not limited to: current or recent\nemployment at the company or a subsidiary;\nbeing, or representing, a shareholder with a\nsubstantial shareholding in the company;\ninterlocking directorships; lengthy tenure,\nand having any other interest, business, or\nother relationship which could, or could\nreasonably be perceived to, materially\ninterfere with a director\u2019s ability to act in\nthe best interests of the company and\nshareholders.\n\nA-6\n\nWe may vote against the election of non-\nindependent directors if the board does not\nhave a sufficient balance of independence. We\nmay also vote against the election of the\nchair of the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if this is a perennial issue.\nIndependent board leadership Practices across\nmarkets differ, as do board structures, but we\nobserve two main approaches to independent\nboard leadership. One is a non-executive,\nindependent chair of the board who is\nresponsible for leading the board in the\neffective exercise of its duties. The other is\na lead or senior independent director, who is\nresponsible for coordinating with the other\nnon-executive directors and working closely\nwith the executive chair on the board agenda\nand other board procedures. In this case, the\nexecutive chair and the lead independent\ndirector work together to ensure the board is\neffectively fulfilling its responsibilities.\nIn our view, the independent leader of the\nboard, and/or the chair of a relevant\ncommittee, should be available to investors to\ndiscuss board governance matters such as CEO\nsuccession, executive pay, and board\nperformance. We look to boards to explain\ntheir independent board leadership model and\nhow it serves the interests of shareholders.\nWe may vote against the election of the chair\nof the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if there is not an identified\nindependent leader of the board with clear\nresponsibilities for board performance. We may\nvote against the most senior independent\ndirector if the board has a policy of not\nengaging with shareholders. Tenure and\nsuccession Boards should establish the length\nof time a director would normally be expected\nto serve, in line with market norms where\nthose exist. In such markets, we find it\nhelpful when companies disclose their approach\nto director tenure particularly around the\ncontributions of directors who have served for\nlonger periods than provided for in local\npractices. In our experience, long-serving\ndirectors could become less independent given\ntheir relationship with management and\ninvolvement in past board decisions.\nSuccession planning for board roles helps\nachieve the appropriate cadence of turnover\nthat balances renewal through the regular\nintroduction of directors with fresh\nperspectives and expertise with continuity\nthrough the retention of directors with long-\nterm knowledge of the board and company. In\nmarkets where there is not specific director\ntenure guidance, we may vote against the\nelection of the chair of the committee\nresponsible for board composition if there is\nnot a clearly disclosed approach to director\ntenure and board renewal. We may vote against\nthe election of directors who have served for\nlonger duration than typical in markets with\nspecific guidance, where the case for their\ncontinued service is not evident. Capacity To\nbe effective and engaged, directors must\ncommit appropriate time and energy to the\nrole. A board should assess the ability of its\nmembers to maintain an appropriate focus on\nboard matters and the company taking into\nconsideration competing responsibilities. We\nrecognize that board leadership roles vary\nacross markets in responsibilities and\nrequired time commitment but note that they\nare generally more intensive than a standard\ndirectorship. We will take local norms and\npractices into consideration when making our\nvoting determinations across markets. We may\nvote against the election of directors who do\nnot seem to have sufficient capacity to\neffectively fulfil their duties to the board\nand company. Director elections In support of\ndirector accountability to shareholders,\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. A classified\nboard structure may be justified by a company\nwhen it needs consistency and stability during\na time of transition, or on the basis of its\nbusiness model, e.g., a non-operating company\nsuch as closed-end funds. Shareholders should\nhave the opportunity to evaluate nominated\ndirectors individually rather than in bundled\nslates. We look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on each director\nstanding for election so that shareholders can\nassess their capabilities and suitability. We\nwill not support the election of directors\nwhose names and biographical details have not\nbeen disclosed sufficiently in advance of the\nshareholder meeting.\n\nA-7\n\nEach director\u2019s appointment should be\ndependent on receiving a simple majority of\nthe votes cast at the shareholder meeting.\nWhere a company\u2019s practices differ, we look to\nthe board to provide a detailed explanation as\nto how its approach best serves investors\u2019\ninterests. We may vote for shareholder or\nmanagement proposals seeking to establish\nannual election of directors and/or a simple\nmajority vote standard for director elections.\nWe may vote against all the directors standing\nfor election as part of a single slate if we\nhave concerns about the profile or performance\nof an individual director. Committees Many\nboards establish committees to focus on\nspecific responsibilities of the board such as\naudit and risk, governance and human capital,\nand executive compensation, amongst other\nmatters. We do not prescribe to companies what\ncommittees they should establish but we seek\nto understand the board\u2019s rationale for the\ncommittee structure it determines is\nappropriate. We note that, in some markets,\nregulation requires such committees. The\nresponsibilities of each committee should be\nclear, and the board should ensure that all\ncritical matters are assigned either to the\nfull board or to one of the committees. The\nboard should disclose to shareholders the\nstructure, membership, proportion of\nindependent directors, and responsibilities of\neach committee. The responsibilities we\ntypically see assigned to the three most\ncommon committees include: \u2022 Audit and risk \u2013\noversight responsibilities for the integrity\nof financial reporting, risk management and\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements; may also play an oversight role\nin relation to the internal audit function and\nwhistleblowing mechanisms. \u2022 Nominating,\ngovernance and human capital \u2013 ensures\nappropriate corporate governance principles\nand practices including the periodic review of\nboard performance; responsible for succession\nplanning for CEO and key board roles, as well\nas the director appointment process; may also\nhave oversight responsibilities for human\ncapital management strategies including\ncorporate culture and purpose. \u2022 Executive\ncompensation \u2013 determines the compensation\npolicies and programs for the CEO and other\nexecutive officers, approves annual awards and\npayments under the policies; may also have\noversight responsibilities for firm- wide\ncompensation policies. We may vote against the\nelection of the chair of the committee or\nother directors serving as committee members\nto convey our concerns and provide feedback on\nhow a committee has undertaken its\nresponsibilities. We may vote against the\nelection of the most senior non-executive\ndirector if there is not a clearly disclosed\napproach to board committees. Board and\ndirector evaluation We consider it best\npractice for companies to conduct an annual\nreview of the performance of the board, the\ncommittees, the chair and individual\ndirectors. Periodically, this review could be\nundertaken by an independent third party able\nto bring objective perspectives to the board\non governance and performance. We encourage\ncompanies to disclose their approach to and\nobjectives of evaluations, including any\nchanges made to the board\u2019s approach as a\nresult. Access to independent advice To\nsupport the directors in effectively\nfulfilling their duties to the company and\nshareholders, they should have access to\nindependent advice. When circumstances\nwarrant, boards should be able to retain\nindependent third parties to advise on\ncritical matters. These might include new\nindustry developments such as emergent and\ndisruptive technology, operating events with\nmaterial consequences for the company\u2019s\nreputation and/or performance, or significant\ntransactions. Board committees may similarly\nretain third parties to advise them on\nspecialist matters such as audit, compensation\nand succession planning. Executive\ncompensation Boards should establish\ncompensation arrangements that enable the\ncompany to recruit, retain and reward the\ncaliber of executive management necessary to\nlead and operate the company to deliver\nsuperior financial returns over time. We focus\non alignment between variable pay and a\ncompany\u2019s financial performance. Generally,\nexecutive compensation arrangements have four\ncomponents: base salary, annual bonus that\nrewards performance against short-term\nmetrics, share-based incentives that reward\nperformance against long-term metrics, and\n\nA-8\n\npensions and benefits. In our observation,\nbase salary, pensions and benefits are largely\nset relative to market norms and benchmarks.\nThe annual bonus and share-based incentive, or\nvariable pay plans, tend to be tailored to the\ncompany, its sector and long-term strategy, as\nwell as the individuals the board is seeking\nto recruit and motivate. Recognizing the\nunique circumstances of each company, we\ndetermine whether to support a company\u2019s\napproach to executive compensation on a case-\nby-case basis. We rely on companies providing\nsufficient quantitative and qualitative\ninformation in their disclosures to enable\nshareholders to understand the compensation\narrangements and assess the alignment with\ninvestors\u2019 interests. Features we look for in\ncompensation arrangements include: \u2022 Fixed pay\ncomponents, including base salary, benefits\nand prerequisites that are appropriate in the\ncontext of the company\u2019s size, sector and\nmarket. \u2022 Variable pay subject to performance\nmetrics that are closely linked to the\ncompany\u2019s short- and long-term strategic\nobjectives. \u2022 Long-term incentives that\nmotivate sustained performance across a multi-\nyear period. \u2022 A balance between fixed and\nvariable pay, short- and long-term incentives,\nand specific instruments (cash and equity\nawards) that promotes pay program durability\nand seldom necessitates one-off, discretionary\npayments. \u2022 Outcomes that are consistent with\nthe returns to investors over the relevant\ntime period. \u2022 Board discretion, if allowed\nwithin the variable pay arrangements, to be\nused sparingly, responsibly and transparently.\n\u2022 A requirement, that participants in long-\nterm share-based incentive plans build a\nmeaningful shareholding in the company within\na defined time period, as determined by the\nboard. \u2022 Change of control provisions that\nappropriately balance the interests of\nexecutives and shareholders. \u2022 Clawback or\nmalus provisions that allow the company to\nrecoup or hold back variable compensation from\nindividuals whose awards were based on\nfraudulent activities, misstated financial\nreports, or executive misconduct. \u2022 Severance\narrangements that protect the company\u2019s\ninterests but do not cost more than is\ncontractual. We may vote against proposals to\nintroduce new share-based incentives, approve\nexisting policies or plans, or approve the\ncompensation report where we do not see\nalignment between executive compensation\narrangements and our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. When there is not an alternative,\nor where there have been multi-year issues\nwith compensation misaligned with performance,\nwe may vote against the election of the chair\nof the responsible committee, or the most\nsenior independent director. Non-executive\ndirector compensation Companies generally pay\nnon-executive directors an annual retainer or\nfee in cash, shares or a combination of the\ntwo. Some companies also pay additional fees\nfor service on board committees or in board\nleadership roles. We do not support non-\nexecutive directors participating in\nperformance-based incentive plans as doing so\nmay create a conflict of interest and\nundermine their independence from management,\nwhom they oversee. Capital structure Boards\nare responsible for ensuring senior executive\nleadership has established a capital strategy\nthat achieves appropriate capital allocation\nand management in support of long-term\nfinancial resilience. Where company practices\ndiverge from those set out below, we look for\ncompanies to disclose why they view these\npractices to be aligned with shareholders\u2019\ninterests. We may vote against management\nproposals seeking capital-related authorities\nor the election of the most senior independent\ndirector if we have concerns about a company\u2019s\napproach. We may also support a shareholder\nproposal seeking conversion of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights to a one-share,\none-vote standard. Share issuance We assess\nrequests for share issuance for particular\ntransactions on a case-by-case basis. We will\ngenerally support authorities to issue shares\nwhen subject to pre-emptive rights, and up to\n20% absent pre-emptive rights. Companies\nshould seek regular approval of these\nauthorities to allow shareholders to take into\nconsideration how prior authorities were used,\nas well as the current circumstances of the\ncompany and the market environment.\n\nA-9\n\nShare buybacks We assess share buyback\nproposals in the context of the company\u2019s\ndisclosed capital management strategy and\nmanagement\u2019s determination of the appropriate\nbalance between investment that supports the\nlong-term growth of the company and returning\ncash to investors. We also take into\nconsideration the effect of a buyback program\non the company\u2019s balance sheet and executive\ncompensation arrangements and the price at\nwhich shares are repurchased relative to\nmarket price. Companies should seek regular\napproval of these authorities to allow\nshareholders to take into consideration how\nprior authorities were used, as well as the\ncurrent circumstances of the company and the\nmarket environment. We would normally expect\ncompanies to cancel repurchased shares. If a\ncompany plans to retain them as treasury\nshares, management should provide a detailed\nrationale in the context of the disclosed\ncapital management strategy. Dividends We\ngenerally defer to management and the board on\ndividend policy but may engage to seek further\nclarification where a proposed dividend\nappears out of line with the company\u2019s\nfinancial position. Differentiated voting\nrights We prefer companies to adopt a one-\nshare, one-vote structure for share classes\nwith the same economic exposure. Certain\ncompanies, particularly those new to public\nmarkets, could make the case to adopt a\ndifferentiated voting rights structure, or\ndual class stock. In those situations, we\nencourage companies to evaluate and seek\napproval for their capital structure on a\nperiodic basis. Transactions and special\nsituations We monitor developments in\ntransactions and special situations closely\nand undertake our own detailed analyses of\nproposals. Mergers and acquisitions We\nevaluate proposed mergers or acquisitions by\nassessing the financial outcome for our\nclients as minority shareholders. Management\nshould provide an assessment of the proposed\ntransaction\u2019s strategic and financial\nrationale, along with its execution and\noperational risks. We review each transaction\nindependently based on these factors and the\ndegree to which the transaction enhances\nshareholder value. The board should consider\nestablishing an ad hoc transaction committee\nto undertake an independent assessment of a\nsignificant merger or acquisition, in advance\nof making its recommendation to shareholders.\nWe will vote against transactions that, in our\nassessment, do not advance our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. Anti-takeover defenses In\nprinciple, we do not support companies using\nanti-takeover defenses, also known as poison\npills or shareholder rights plans, as they can\nentrench management and boards which have not\ndelivered long-term shareholder value. By\nexception, a poison pill may be supported if\nits purpose is to delay a takeover that is\nconsidered sub-optimal and enable management\nto seek an improved offer. Similarly,\nmanagement could make the case to use a poison\npill to block a shareholder activism campaign\nthat may be counter to the interests of other\ninvestors. Defense mechanisms introduced in\nthese circumstances should be limited in term\nand threshold, and also be closely monitored\nby the independent members of the board. We\nlook for a shareholder vote for any mechanisms\nexpected to be in place for more than 12\nmonths. Shareholder activism When companies\nare the focus of an activism campaign, we may\nengage with the activist to understand their\nanalysis and objectives, once they have gone\npublic. We will also engage with company\nmanagement and possibly board members,\nespecially those the activist may be seeking\nto replace. In our assessment, we evaluate\nvarious factors, including the concerns raised\nby the activist and the case for change; the\nquality of both the activist\u2019s and\nmanagement\u2019s plans; and the qualifications of\neach party\u2019s candidates. We evaluate each\ncontested situation by assessing the potential\nfinancial outcome for our clients as minority\nshareholders.\n\nA-10\n\nWe may support board candidates nominated by a\nshareholder activist if the activist has\ndemonstrated that their case for change\nenhances shareholder value, or if the\nincumbent board members do not demonstrate the\nrelevant skills and expertise or have a poor\ntrack record of protecting shareholders\u2019\ninterests. Significant shareholders and\nrelated party transactions Boards of companies\nwith affiliated shareholders or directors\nshould be able to demonstrate that the\ninterests of all shareholders are given\nequitable consideration. Transactions with\nrelated parties, such as significant\nshareholders or companies connected with the\npublic company, should be disclosed in detail\nand conducted on terms similar to what would\nobjectively have been agreed with a non-\nrelated party. Such transactions should be\nreviewed and approved by the independent\nmembers of the board, and if voted on, only\ndisinterested shareholders should vote.\nCorporate reporting, risk management and audit\nInvestors depend on corporate reporting, both\nregulatory and voluntary, to understand a\ncompany\u2019s strategy, its implementation and\nfinancial performance, as well as to assess\nthe quality of management and operations and\npotential for the company to create\nshareholder value over time. The board should\noversee corporate reporting and the policies\nand procedures underpinning the internal audit\nfunction and external audit. A company\u2019s\nfinancial reporting should provide decision-\nuseful information for investors and other\nstakeholders on its financial performance and\nposition. It should provide an accurate and\nbalanced assessment of the risks and\nopportunities the company faces in realizing\nits long-term strategy. Accordingly, the\nassumptions made by management and reviewed by\nthe auditor in preparing the financial\nstatements should be reasonable and justified.\nFinancial statements should be prepared in\naccordance with globally developed reporting\nstandards and any divergence from generally\naccepted accounting principles should be\nexplained in detail and justified. Accounting\nrestatements should be explained in detail and\nany remedial actions, and the implications of\nthese, disclosed. In this context, audit\ncommittees play a vital role in a company\u2019s\nfinancial reporting system by providing\nindependent oversight of the accounts,\nmaterial financial and, where appropriate to\nthe jurisdiction, nonfinancial information,\ninternal control frameworks and Enterprise\nRisk Management systems. In our view,\neffective audit committee oversight\nstrengthens the quality and reliability of a\ncompany\u2019s financial statements and provides an\nimportant level of reassurance to\nshareholders. Audit committees should have a\nprocedure in place for assessing the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process annually.\nSimilarly, material sustainability-related\nfactors that are integral to how a company\nmanages risks or generates revenue should be\ndisclosed. In our view, the standards\ndeveloped by the International Sustainability\nStandards Board, can be helpful to companies\nin preparing such reports (4) . Companies\nshould establish robust risk management and\ninternal control processes appropriate to the\ncompany\u2019s business, risk tolerance, and\nregulatory environment. A credible\nwhistleblowing system for employees, and\npotentially other stakeholders, can be a\nuseful mechanism for ensuring that senior\nmanagement and the board are aware of\npotential misconduct or breaches in risk\nmanagement and internal control processes. A\ncomprehensive audit conducted by an\nindependent audit firm contributes to investor\nconfidence in the quality of corporate\nreporting. It is helpful when the audit report\ngives some insight into the scope and focus of\nthe audit, as well as any critical audit\nmatters identified and how these were\nresolved. A comprehensive and effective audit\nis time and resource intensive, and the audit\nfee should be commensurate. Fees paid to the\naudit firm for non-audit consulting should not\nexceed the audit fee to a degree that may\nprompt concerns about the independence of the\naudit. The audit committee should explain its\nposition on auditor tenure and how it\nconfirmed that the auditor remained\nindependent.\n\n(4) The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-11\n\nWe may vote against the election of the\nresponsible directors if corporate reporting\nis insufficient or there are material\nmisstatements in financial reports. In markets\nwhere relevant, we may vote against a proposal\nto approve the financial statements or the\ndischarge of the board when we are concerned\nabout the quality of the reporting or the\naudit. We may vote against proposals to\nappoint the auditor, ratify the audit report,\nor approve the audit fee if we are concerned\nabout the auditor\u2019s independence, the quality\nof the audit, or there are material\nmisstatements in financial reports and the\nboard has not established reasonable\nremediation plans. Shareholder rights and\nprotections General shareholder meetings\nCompanies normally have an annual general\nmeeting of shareholders at which routine and\nnon-routine items of business are discussed\nand voted on by shareholders in attendance or\nsubmitting proxy votes. Companies should\ndisclose materials relevant to the shareholder\nmeeting sufficiently in advance so that\nshareholders can take them into consideration\nin their voting decisions. Many companies\noffer shareholders the option of participating\nin the meeting virtually which, whilst\nwelcome, should not limit the rights of\nshareholders to participate as they would\nduring an in-person meeting. We may vote\nagainst directors when materials related to\nthe business of the shareholder meeting are\nnot provided in a timely manner or do not\nprovide sufficient information for us to take\nan informed voting decision. We may vote\nagainst directors if the format of the\nshareholder meeting does not accommodate\nreasonable shareholder participation. Bylaw\namendments We review bylaw amendments proposed\nby management on a case-by-case basis and will\ngenerally support those that are aligned with\nthe interests of minority shareholders. Any\nmaterial changes to the bylaws should be\nexplained in detail and put to a shareholder\nvote. We may vote against bylaw amendments\nthat reduce shareholder rights and\nprotections. We may vote against directors if\nmaterial changes are made to the bylaws\nwithout shareholder approval. If not provided\nfor in the relevant corporate law, company\nbylaws should allow shareholders, individually\nor as a group, with a meaningful shareholding\nthe right to call a special meeting of\nshareholders. The shareholding required to\nexercise this right should balance its utility\nwith the cost to the company of holding\nspecial meetings. If not provided for in the\nrelevant corporate law, company bylaws should\nallow shareholders, individually or as a\ngroup, with a meaningful shareholding the\nright to nominate directors to the company\u2019s\nboard. The threshold for this right should be\nset so that shareholders can exercise it\nwithout being unduly disruptive to the board\u2019s\nown nomination process. Whilst we would not\nuse either of these rights ourselves, we see\nthem as important accountability mechanisms.\nWe may vote for a shareholder proposal seeking\nthe addition of either of these provisions to\na company\u2019s bylaws. Change of domicile We\ngenerally defer to management on proposals to\nchange a company\u2019s domicile as long as the\nrationale for doing so is consistent with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel and the related costs are immaterial. We\nmay vote against directors or a proposal to\nchange a company\u2019s domicile where it does not\nseem aligned with our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. Changes to a company\u2019s purpose or\nthe nature of its business Plans to materially\nchange the nature of a company\u2019s business or\nits purpose should be disclosed and explained\nin the context of long-term strategy and\nbusiness dynamics. Such changes may\nsignificantly alter an investor\u2019s views on the\nsuitability of a company for their investment\nstrategy or portfolio. Where relevant, we may\nvote against proposals to change a company\u2019s\npurpose or the nature of its business if the\nboard has not provided a credible argument for\nchange.\n\nA-12\n\nShareholder proposals Shareholders in many\nmarkets, who meet certain eligibility\ncriteria, have the right to submit proposals\nto the general shareholder meeting asking a\ncompany to take a particular course of action\nsubject to the proposal being supported by a\nmajority of votes cast at the meeting. The\ntopics raised address a range of governance,\nsocial and environmental matters that may be\nrelevant to a company\u2019s business. Shareholder\nproposals are considered by many investors to\nbe an escalation tool when a company is\nunresponsive to their engagement. We vote on\nthese proposals on a case-by-case basis. We\nassess the relevance of the topic raised to a\ncompany\u2019s business and its current approach,\nwhether the actions sought are consistent with\nshareholders\u2019 interests, and what impact the\nproposal being acted upon might have on\nfinancial performance. Our general approach\nwhere we have concerns about a company\u2019s\ngovernance, disclosures or performance is to\nengage to understand the apparent difference\nin perspective. If we continue to believe the\ncompany is not acting in shareholders\u2019\nfinancial interests, we may vote against the\nelection of directors. We may support a\nrelevant shareholder proposal if doing so\nreinforces the points made in our engagement\nor is aligned with our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. We generally do not support\nshareholder proposals that are legally binding\non the company, seek to alter a company\u2019s\nstrategy or direct its operations, or are\nunrelated to how a company manages risk or\ngenerates financial returns. BlackRock is\nsubject to legal and regulatory requirements\nin the U.S. that place restrictions and\nlimitations on how we can interact with the\ncompanies in which we invest on behalf of our\nclients, including our ability to submit\nshareholder proposals. We can vote on behalf\nof clients who authorize us to do so, on\nproposals put forth by others. Corporate\npolitical activities We seek to understand how\ncompanies ensure that their direct and\nindirect engagement in the policy making\nprocess is consistent with their public\nstatements on policy matters important to the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy. The board should\nbe aware of the approach taken to corporate\npolitical activities as there can be\nreputational risks arising from\ninconsistencies. Companies should, as a\nminimum, meet all regulatory disclosure\nrequirements on political activities, and\nideally, provide accessible and clear\ndisclosures to shareholders on policy\npositions, public policy engagement activities\nand political donations. To mitigate the risk\nof inconsistencies, companies can usefully\nassess the alignment between their policy\npriorities and the policy positions of the\ntrade associations of which they are active\nmembers and any engagements undertaken by\ntrade associations on behalf of members.\nGenerally, this is an engagement matter,\nalthough we may support a relevant shareholder\nproposal, or vote against directors, where a\ncompany\u2019s disclosures are insufficient, or it\nbecomes public that there is a material\ncontradiction in a company\u2019s public policy\npositions and its policy engagement.\nSustainability, or environmental and social,\nconsiderations We seek to understand how\ncompanies manage the risks and opportunities\ninherent in their business operations. In our\nexperience, sustainability-related factors (5)\nthat are relevant to a company\u2019s business or\nmaterial to its financial performance, are\ngenerally operational considerations embedded\ninto day-to-day management systems. Certain\nsustainability issues may also inform long-\nterm strategic planning, for example,\ninvesting in product innovation in\nanticipation of changing consumer demand or\nadapting supply chains in response to changing\nregulatory requirements. We recognize that the\nspecific sustainability-related factors that\nmay be financially material or business\nrelevant will vary by company business model,\nsector, key markets, and time horizon, amongst\nother considerations. From company disclosures\nand our engagement, we aim to understand how\nmanagement is identifying, assessing and\nintegrating material\n\n(5) By material sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk\nand financial value creation in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues include, but are not\nlimited to, water use, land use, waste\nmanagement, and climate risk. Examples of\nsocial issues include, but are not limited to,\nhuman capital management, impacts on the\ncommunities in which a company operates,\ncustomer loyalty, and relationships with\nregulators. It is our view that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and manage\nmaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities relevant to their businesses.\nGovernance is the core means by which boards\ncan oversee the creation of durable financial\nvalue over time. Appropriate risk oversight of\nbusiness-relevant and material sustainability-\nrelated considerations is a component of a\nsound governance framework.\n\nA-13\n\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\ninto their business decision-making and\npractices. Doing so helps us undertake a more\nholistic assessment of a company\u2019s potential\nfinancial performance and the likely risk-\nadjusted returns of an investment. We may vote\nagainst directors or support a relevant\nshareholder proposal if we have concerns about\nhow a company is managing or disclosing its\napproach to material sustainability-related\nrisks that may impact financial returns. Key\nstakeholders In our view, companies should\nunderstand and take into consideration the\ninterests of the various parties on whom they\ndepend for their success over time. It is for\neach company to determine their key\nstakeholders based on what is material to\ntheir business and long-term financial\nperformance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. Companies\nthat appropriately balance the interests of\ninvestors and other stakeholders are, in our\nexperience, more likely to be financially\nresilient over time. Climate and\ndecarbonization investment objectives Certain\nactive BlackRock funds have climate and\ndecarbonization objectives in addition to\nfinancial objectives. Consistent with the\nobjectives of those investment strategies, our\nstewardship activity in relation to the\nholdings in those funds differs in some\nrespects from BAIS\u2019 benchmark guidelines,\nwhich are described above. Specifically, for\nthose funds\u2019 holdings, we look to investee\ncompanies to demonstrate that they are aligned\nwith a decarbonization pathway that means\ntheir business model would be viable in a low-\ncarbon economy, i.e., one in which global\ntemperature rise is limited to 1.5\u2070C above\npre-industrial levels. This approach is only\ntaken following BlackRock receiving the\nexplicit approval from the applicable fund\nboard. The decarbonization stewardship\nguidelines focus on companies which produce\ngoods and services that contribute to real\nworld decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low carbon transition, based\non reported and estimated scopes 1, 2, and 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. These companies\nshould provide disclosures that set out their\ngovernance, strategy, risk management\nprocesses and metrics and targets relevant to\ndecarbonization. These disclosures should\ninclude an explanation of the decarbonization\nscenarios a company is using in its near- and\nlong-term planning, as well as its scope 1,\nscope 2 and material scope 3 greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and reduction targets for\nscope 1 and 2 emissions. As with the BAIS\nbenchmark policies, we consider the climate-\nrisk reporting standard issued by the\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board,\nIFRS S2, a useful reference for such\nreporting. Under these climate- and\ndecarbonization-specific guidelines, BAIS may\nrecommend a vote against directors or support\nfor a relevant shareholder proposal if a\ncompany does not appear to be adequately\naddressing or disclosing material climate-\nrelated risks. We may recommend supporting\nshareholder proposals seeking information\nrelevant to a company\u2019s stated low-carbon\ntransition strategy and targets that the\ncompany does not currently provide and that\nwould be helpful to investment decision-\nmaking. As under the BAIS benchmark approach,\nthe active portfolio managers are ultimately\nresponsible for voting consistent with their\ninvestment mandate and fund objectives.\nAppendix 1: How we fulfil and oversee our\nactive investment stewardship responsibilities\nOversight The Global Head of BAIS has primary\noversight of and responsibility for the team\u2019s\nactivities, including voting in accordance\nwith the BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship Global Engagement and Voting\nGuidelines ( \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ), which\nrequire the application of professional\njudgment and consideration of each company\u2019s\nunique circumstances, as well as input from\nactive investors. BAIS is independent from\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship in our\nengagement and voting activities, reporting\nlines, and oversight. The Active Investment\nStewardship Oversight Committee, comprised of\nsenior representatives of the active\ninvestment, legal and risk teams, reviews and\nadvises on amendments to BAIS\u2019 Global\nEngagement and Voting Guidelines. The\nCommittee also considers developments in\ncorporate governance, related public policy,\nand market norms and how these might influence\nBAIS\u2019 policies and practices. The Committee\ndoes not determine voting decisions, which are\nthe responsibility of BAIS and the relevant\nactive equity investors.\n\nA-14\n\nIn addition, there is a standing advisory\ngroup of senior active investors who counsel\nBAIS on complex or high-profile votes before a\nrecommendation is finalized and escalated to\nthe portfolio managers with holdings in the\ncompany under consideration. This group also\nformally reviews any revisions to the\nEngagement and Voting Guidelines proposed by\nBAIS as part of its annual review. BAIS\ncarries out engagement with companies in\ncollaboration with active investment\ncolleagues, executes proxy votes, and conducts\nvote operations (including maintaining records\nof votes cast) in a manner consistent with the\nGuidelines. BAIS also conducts research on\ncorporate governance issues and participates\nin industry discussions to contribute to and\nkeep abreast of important developments in the\ncorporate governance field. BAIS may use third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties (see \u201c Use and oversight of\nthird-party vote services providers \u201d below).\nVoting guidelines and vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. We carefully consider\nthe voting items submitted to funds and other\nfiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which\nwe have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or\nrefrains from voting) for each Fund for which\nwe have voting authority based on our\nevaluation of the alignment of the voting\nitems with the long-term economic interests of\nour clients, in the exercise of our\nindependent business judgment, and without\nregard to the relationship of the issuer (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) to the Fund, the Fund\u2019s\naffiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees (see \u201c\nConflicts management policies and procedures,\n\u201d below). When exercising voting rights, BAIS\nwill normally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines, although\nportfolio managers have the right to vote\ndifferently on their holdings if they\ndetermine doing so is more aligned with the\ninvestment objective and financial interests\nof clients invested in the funds they manage.\nThe Guidelines are not intended to be\nexhaustive. BAIS applies the Guidelines on a\ncase-by-case basis, in the context of the\nindividual circumstances of each company and\nthe specific issue under review. As such, the\nGuidelines do not indicate how BAIS will vote\nin every instance. Rather, they reflect our\nview about corporate governance issues\ngenerally, and provide insight into how we\ntypically approach issues that commonly arise\non corporate ballots. The Guidelines are\nreviewed annually and updated as necessary to\nreflect changes in market practices,\ndevelopments in corporate governance and\nfeedback from companies and clients. In this\nway, BAIS aims to maintain policies that\nexplain our approach to governance practices\nmost aligned with clients\u2019 long-term financial\ninterests. In certain markets, proxy voting\ninvolves logistical issues which can affect\nBAIS\u2019 ability to vote such proxies, as well as\nthe desirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. BlackRock votes proxies in these\nsituations on a \u201c best-efforts \u201d basis. In\naddition, BAIS may determine that it is\ngenerally in the interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients not to vote proxies (or not to vote\nour full allocation) if the costs (including\nbut not limited to opportunity costs\nassociated with share-blocking constraints)\nassociated with exercising a vote are expected\nto outweigh the benefit the client would\nderive by voting on the proposal. Voting\nChoice BlackRock offers Voting Choice, a\nprogram that provides eligible clients with\nmore opportunities to participate in the proxy\nvoting process where legally and operationally\nviable. Voting Choice is currently available\nfor eligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nand Canada that use systematic active equity\n(SAE) and multi-asset strategies. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) are eligible for BlackRock\nVoting Choice regardless of their investment\nstrategies (6) .\n\n(6) With Voting Choice, SMAs have the ability\nto select from a set of voting policies from\nthird-party proxy advisers the policy that\nbest aligns with their views and preferences.\nBlackRock can then use its proxy voting\ninfrastructure to cast votes based on the\nclient\u2019s selected voting policy.\n\nA-15\n\nAs a result, the shares attributed to\nBlackRock in company share registers may be\nvoted differently depending on whether our\nclients have authorized BAIS to vote on their\nbehalf, have authorized BlackRock to vote in\naccordance with a third-party policy, or have\nelected to vote shares in accordance with\ntheir own policy. Our clients have greater\ncontrol over proxy voting because of Voting\nChoice. BlackRock does not disclose client\ninformation, including a client\u2019s selection of\nproxy policy, without client consent. Use and\noversight of third-party vote services\nproviders Third-party vote services providers\n\u2013 or proxy research firms - provide research\nand recommendations on proxy votes, as well as\nvoting infrastructure. As mentioned\npreviously, BlackRock contracts primarily with\nthe vote services provider ISS and leverages\nits online platform to supply research and\nsupport voting, record keeping, and reporting\nprocesses. We also use Glass Lewis\u2019 research\nand analysis as an input into our voting\nprocess. It is important to note that,\nalthough proxy research firms provide\nimportant data and analysis, BAIS does not\nrely solely on their information or follow\ntheir voting recommendations. A company\u2019s\ndisclosures, our past engagements and voting,\ninvestment colleagues\u2019 insights and our voting\nguidelines are important inputs into our\nvoting decisions on behalf of clients. Given\nthe large universe of actively held companies,\nBAIS employs the proxy services provider to\nstreamline the voting process by making voting\nrecommendations based on BAIS\u2019 voting\nguidelines when the items on a shareholder\nmeeting agenda are routine. Agenda items that\nare not routine are referred back to BAIS to\nassess, escalate as necessary to the relevant\nportfolio managers and vote. BAIS reviews and\ncan override the recommendations of the vote\nservices provider at any time prior to the\nvote deadline. Both BAIS and the vote services\nprovider actively monitor securities filings,\nresearch reports, company announcements, and\ndirect communications from companies to ensure\nawareness of supplemental disclosures and\nproxy materials that may require a\nmodification of votes. BAIS closely monitors\nthe third-party vote services providers we\ncontract with to ensure that they are meeting\nour service level expectations and have\neffective policies and procedures in place to\nmanage potential conflicts of interest. Our\noversight of service providers includes\nregular meetings with client service teams,\nsystematic monitoring of vendor operations, as\nwell as annual due diligence meetings in\naccordance with BlackRock\u2019s firmwide policies.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBAIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BAIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access. BAIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBAIS may engage directly with\n\nA-16\n\nBlackRock clients, business partners and/or\nthird parties, and/or with employees with\nsales, vendor management, or business\npartnership roles, in discussions regarding\nour approach to stewardship, general corporate\ngovernance matters, client reporting needs,\nand/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related\nclient service levels are met \u2022 Determined to\nengage, in certain instances, an independent\nthird-party voting service provider to make\nproxy voting recommendations as a further\nsafeguard to avoid potential conflicts of\ninterest, to satisfy regulatory compliance\nrequirements, or as may be otherwise required\nby applicable law. In such circumstances, the\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider provides BlackRock with\nrecommendations, in accordance with the\nGuidelines, as to how to vote such proxies.\nBlackRock uses an independent third-party\nvoting service provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations for shares of BlackRock, Inc.\nand companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc.\nBlackRock may also use an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for: \u2022 public companies\nthat include BlackRock employees on their\nboards of directors \u2022 public companies of\nwhich a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as\na senior executive or a member of the board of\ndirectors \u2022 public companies that are the\nsubject of certain transactions involving\nBlackRock Funds \u2022 public companies that are\njoint venture partners with BlackRock, and \u2022\npublic companies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nActive Investment Stewardship Oversight\nCommittee appoints and reviews the performance\nof the independent third-party voting service\nproviders, generally on an annual basis.\nSecurities lending When so authorized,\nBlackRock acts as a securities lending agent\non behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a\nwell-regulated practice that contributes to\ncapital market efficiency. It also enables\nfunds to generate additional returns while\nallowing fund providers to keep fund expenses\nlower. With regard to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\ncannot vote shares on loan and may determine\nto recall them for voting, as guided by our\nfiduciary duty as an asset manager to our\nclients in helping them achieve their\ninvestment goals. While this has occurred in a\nlimited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). BAIS works with active\nportfolio managers, as well as colleagues in\nthe Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams, to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nshares would not warrant recalling securities\non loan. However, in certain instances,\nBlackRock may determine, in our independent\nbusiness judgment as a fiduciary, that the\nvalue of voting outweighs the securities\nlending revenue loss to clients and would\ntherefore recall shares to be voted in those\ninstances. Periodically, BlackRock reviews our\nprocess for determining whether to recall\nsecurities on loan in order to vote and may\nmodify it as necessary. Reporting and vote\ntransparency BAIS is committed to transparency\nin the stewardship work we do on behalf of\nclients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and disclosure on\nour website.\n\nA-17\n\nWant to know more? blackrock.com/stewardship |\nContactActiveStewardship@blackrock.com The\ndocument is provided for information purposes\nonly and is subject to change.

BlackRock\nhas adopted the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship Global Benchmark Policy( \u201c\nGuidelines \u201d ) (as from time to time amended,\nthe \u201c Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\nindex equity Funds managed by BlackRock,\nexcept for the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. In\naddition, BlackRock has adopted guidelines and\nprocedures (as from time to time amended, the\n\u201c BlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting for matters covered in the BlackRock\nClimate and Decarbonization Stewardship\nGuidelines by the Funds listed in Appendix A.\nBlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of\nthe Funds covered by this policy on specific\nproxy issues in respect of securities held by\neach such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, as applicable.\nConflicts Management BlackRock Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) maintains policies and\nprocedures that seek to prevent undue\ninfluence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting activity\nand to mitigate material conflicts of interest\nin the exercise of proxy voting\nresponsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in the Guidelines. In\nmitigating conflicts, BIS will adhere to the\nGuidelines. In certain instances, BIS will\nengage an independent third-party voting\nservice provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations as a further safeguard to\navoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw.\n\nA-19\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and BlackRock may\ndetermine to recall them for voting, as guided\nby BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to act\nin clients\u2019 financial interests. The\nGuidelines set forth BlackRock\u2019s approach to\nrecalling securities on loan in connection\nwith proxy voting. Reports to the Board\nBlackRock will report on an annual basis to\nthe Directors on (1) a summary of the proxy\nvoting process as applicable to the Funds\ncovered by this policy in the preceding year\ntogether with a representation that all votes\nwere in accordance with the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, as applicable (2) any\nmaterial changes to the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, including material\nchanges to conflicts management practices,\nthat have not previously been reported.\nAppendix A iShares Climate Conscious &\nTransition MSCI USA ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF\niShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF\niShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF\niShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF\niShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF\niShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI World ex\nUSA ETF\n\nA-20\n\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship Global\nPrinciples for Benchmark Policies Effective as\nof January 2025 The purpose of this document\nis to provide an overarching explanation of\nBlackRock\u2019s global approach to our\nresponsibilities as a shareholder on behalf of\nour clients, the principles that guide our\ndialogue with companies, and our commitments\nto clients in terms of our own governance and\ntransparency.\n                                              \n  Introduction to BlackRock Investment  A-21  \n  Stewardship                                 \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship  A-22  \n  Shareholder rights                    A-22  \n  Stewardship in practice               A-22  \n  Key themes                            A-23  \n  Boards and directors                  A-23  \n  Auditors and audit-related issues     A-25  \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other                      A-26  \n  special transactions                        \n  Executive compensation                A-27  \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                             A-28  \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                       A-30  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                 A-31  \n  BlackRock\u2019s oversight of its                \n  investment                            A-31  \n  stewardship activities                      \n  Voting guidelines and vote execution  A-32  \n  Voting Choice                         A-32  \n  Conflicts management policies and     A-33  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                    A-34  \n  Reporting and vote transparency       A-34  \n                                              \nIntroduction to BlackRock Investment\nStewardship BlackRock\u2019s clients depend on us\nto help them meet their varied investment\ngoals. We consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to be an informed, engaged\nshareholder on their behalf, given the\nbusiness decisions that companies make have a\ndirect impact on our clients\u2019 long-term\ninvestment outcomes and financial well-being.\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a\ndedicated function within BlackRock, which is\nresponsible for engaging with public companies\non behalf of index strategies. Investment\nStewardship is one of the ways we fulfill our\nfiduciary responsibilities as an asset manager\nto our clients. Our sole objective when\nconducting our stewardship program is to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term financial\ninterests. (7) BIS takes a long-term approach\nin our stewardship efforts, reflecting the\ninvestment horizons of the majority of our\nclients. BIS does this through: 1. Engaging\nwith companies in a two-way dialogue to build\nour understanding of a company\u2019s practices and\ninform our voting decisions.\n\n(7) BIS\u2019 Benchmark Policies, and the vote\ndecisions made consistent with these policies,\ntake a financial materiality-based approach\nand are focused solely on advancing clients'\nfinancial interests. BIS\u2019 Benchmark Policies\u2013\ncomprised of the BIS Global Principles,\nregional voting guidelines, and engagement\npriorities \u2013 apply to clients\u2019 assets invested\nthrough index strategies and provide guidance\non our position on common corporate governance\nmatters. We take a globally consistent\napproach, while recognizing the unique markets\nand sectors in which companies operate.\nBlackRock offers a wide range of investment\nproducts and funds to support our clients\u2019\nunique and varied investment objectives. Other\nmaterials on the BIS website might also\nprovide useful context. A-21\n\n2. Voting at shareholder meetings on\nmanagement and shareholder proposals on behalf\nof clients who have delegated voting authority\nto BlackRock. 3. Contributing to industry\ndialogue on stewardship to share our\nperspectives on matters that may impact our\nclients\u2019 investments. 4. Reporting on our\nactivities to inform clients about our\nstewardship efforts on their behalf through a\nrange of publications and direct reporting.\nPhilosophy on investment stewardship Sound\ngovernance is critical to the success of a\ncompany, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. Research indicates that high-\nperforming companies will effectively evaluate\nand address risks and opportunities relevant\nto their businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. (8)\nSetting, executing, and overseeing strategy\nare the responsibility of management and the\nboard. As one of many minority shareholders,\nBlackRock cannot \u2013 and does not try to \u2013\ndirect a company\u2019s strategy or its\nimplementation. Our role, on behalf of\nBlackRock\u2019s clients as long-term investors, is\nto better understand how corporate leadership\nis managing material risks and capitalizing on\nopportunities to help protect and enhance the\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial returns. We aim to take a globally\nconsistent approach, while recognizing the\nunique markets and sectors in which companies\noperate. Shareholder rights Corporate law,\nregulations and listing rules in most markets\nestablish certain fundamental rights attached\nto shareholding. Shareholders should have the\nright to: \u2022 Elect, remove, and nominate\ndirectors, approve the appointment of the\nauditor, and amend the corporate charter or\nby- laws. \u2022 Vote on key board decisions that\nare material to the protection of their\ninvestment, including but not limited to,\nchanges to the purpose of the business,\ndilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and\nthe distribution of income and capital\nstructure. \u2022 Access sufficient and timely\ninformation on material governance, strategic,\nand business matters to make informed\ndecisions. To protect the interest of minority\nshareholders like BlackRock\u2019s clients, BIS\nholds the view that shareholder voting rights\nshould be proportionate to economic\nownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one share, one\nvote \u201d helps to achieve this balance.\nStewardship in practice The assets BlackRock\nmanages belong to our clients, which include\npublic and private pension plans, insurers,\nofficial institutions, endowments,\nuniversities, charities, family offices,\nwealth managers, and ultimately, the\nindividual investors that they serve. Through\nstewardship, we assess how companies are\ncreating long-term financial value to serve\nour clients, many of whom are saving for long-\nterm goals, such as retirement. As\nshareholders of public companies, our clients\nhave the right to vote on matters proposed by\na company\u2019s management or its shareholders.\nVoting is an important mechanism for investors\nto express support for, or concern about, a\ncompany\u2019s performance and most of our clients\nauthorize BlackRock to exercise this right on\ntheir behalf. For those clients, and as a\nfiduciary, BlackRock is legally required to\nmake proxy voting determinations in a manner\nthat is consistent with their investment\nobjectives. BIS does this by casting votes in\nfavor of proposals that, in our assessment,\nwill promote stronger governance and better\noperating practices and, in turn, potentially\nenhance long-term shareholder value. Our vote\ndecisions are informed by our in-depth\nanalysis of company disclosures, engagement\nwith boards and management teams, third-party\nresearch, and comparisons against a company\u2019s\nindustry peers. BIS takes a constructive,\nlong-term approach to our engagement with\ncompanies, reflecting the investment horizons\nof the majority of our clients. An engagement\nis a meeting between BIS and a company\u2019s board\nand management that helps improve our\nunderstanding of the company\u2019s business model\nand material risks and opportunities, to\ninform our voting\n\n(8) PwC, \u201c The 3 things all high-performing\ncompanies do \u201d . Harvard Business Review, \u201c 6\nStrategic Concepts That Set High-Performing\nCompanies Apart \u201d , March 2024.\n\nA-22\n\ndecisions on behalf of clients who authorize\nus to vote on their behalf. In these two-way\nconversations, we listen to and learn directly\nfrom company directors and executives and ask\nquestions relevant to their business. Either a\ncompany or BIS can request an engagement. Many\nof the engagements are initiated by companies\nto discuss their long-term strategy, risk and\nopportunity set, and management\u2019s plan to\ndeliver financial returns through business\ncycles. The ongoing, multiyear nature of our\nengagements allows us to build strong\nrelationships with company leadership and\nmutual understanding on key matters of\ncorporate governance and the drivers of long-\nterm financial performance. Generally, we\nsupport the vote recommendations of the board\nof directors and management. In case of\nconcerns, we typically raise these through\ndialogue with board members and management\nteams first. When we determine it is in our\nclients\u2019 financial interests to convey concern\nto companies through voting, we do so in two\nforms: we might not support the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or we\nmight not support management\u2019s voting\nrecommendation on a shareholder proposal. Key\nthemes While accepted standards and norms of\ncorporate governance can differ between\nmarkets, in our experience, there are certain\nglobally applicable fundamental elements of\ncorporate governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted corporate\ngovernance standards in their domestic market,\n(9) and we ask that, if they do not, they\nexplain how their approach better supports\ndurable, long-term financial value creation.\nThese Principles cover seven key subjects: \u2022\nBoards and directors \u2022 Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues \u2022 Capital structure, mergers,\nasset sales, and other special transactions \u2022\nExecutive compensation \u2022 Material\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\n\u2022 Other corporate governance matters and\nshareholder protections \u2022 Shareholder\nproposals Our regional and market-specific\nvoting guidelines explain how these Principles\ninform our voting decisions in relation to\ncommon ballot items for shareholder meetings\nin those markets. Alongside the Principles and\nregional voting guidelines, BIS publishes our\nengagement priorities which reflect the five\nthemes on which we most frequently engage\ncompanies, where they are relevant, as these\ncan be a source of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship program globally and within each\nmarket. The BIS policies are not prescriptive,\napplied on a pragmatic, case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration a number of factors,\nincluding the sector, market, and business\nenvironment within which a company is\noperating. Boards and directors Companies\nwhose boards are comprised of appropriately\nqualified, engaged directors with professional\ncharacteristics relevant to a company\u2019s\nbusiness enhance the ability of the board to\nadd value and be the voice of shareholders in\nboard discussions. A strong board gives a\ncompany a competitive advantage, providing\nvaluable oversight and contributing to the\nmost important management decisions that\nsupport long-term financial performance. As\npart of their responsibilities, board members\nhave a fiduciary duty to shareholders to\noversee the strategic direction, operations,\nand risk management of a company. This is why\nour investment stewardship efforts have always\nstarted with the performance of the board of\ndirectors, and why we see engagement with, and\nthe election of, directors as one of our most\nimportant responsibilities. We engage, as\nnecessary, with members of the board\u2019s\nnominating and/or governance committee to\nassess whether governance practices\n\n(9) Our regional voting guidelines, which we\npublish on the BIS website, reflect these\ndifferent market standards and norms.\nDepending on the market, generally accepted\npractice is informed by corporate law, market\nregulation, best practices, and industry\ninitiatives, amongst other factors.\n\nA-23\n\nand board composition are appropriate given a\ncompany\u2019s business model and we take into\nconsideration a number of factors, including\nthe sector, market, and business environment\nwithin which a company is operating. We view\nit as good practice when the board establishes\nand maintains a framework of robust and\neffective governance mechanisms to support its\noversight of the company\u2019s strategy and\noperations consistent with the long-term\neconomic interests of investors. There should\nbe clear descriptions of the role of the board\nand the committees of the board and how\ndirectors engage with and oversee management.\nDisclosure of material risks that may affect a\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and financial\nvalue creation, including material\nsustainability-related factors when relevant,\nis helpful for investors to appropriately\nunderstand and assess how effectively\nmanagement is identifying, managing, and\nmitigating such risks. We seek to understand\nmanagement's long-term strategy and the\nmilestones against which investors should\nassess its implementation. If any strategic\ntargets are significantly missed or materially\nrestated, we find it helpful when company\ndisclosures provide a detailed explanation of\nthe changes and an indication of the board's\nrole in reviewing the revised targets. We look\nto the board to articulate the effectiveness\nof these mechanisms in overseeing the\nmanagement of business risks and opportunities\nand the fulfillment of the company\u2019s strategy.\nWhere a company has not adequately disclosed\nand demonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we may consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration its governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are factors we may take into\nconsideration. Regular accountability through\ndirector elections To ensure accountability\nfor their actions on behalf of shareholders,\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. (10) Annual\ndirector elections allow shareholders to\nreaffirm their support for board members\nand/or hold them accountable for their\ndecisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be brought\nonto the board periodically to refresh the\ngroup\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board and seek a balance between\nthe knowledge and experience of longer-serving\ndirectors and the fresh perspectives of\ndirectors who joined more recently. We\nencourage companies to regularly review the\neffectiveness of their board (including its\nsize), and assess directors nominated for\nelection in the context of the composition of\nthe board as a whole. In our view, the\ncompany\u2019s assessment should consider a number\nof factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe breadth and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\ncollectively contribute to the board's\neffectiveness in advising and overseeing\nmanagement in delivering long-term financial\nreturns. Director independence \u2014 from\nmanagement, significant shareholders, or other\nrelated parties \u2013 is a central tenet of sound\ncorporate governance across markets. (11) We\nencourage boards to have a sufficient number\nof independent directors, free from conflicts\nof interest or undue influence, to ensure\nobjectivity in the decision-making of the\nboard and its ability to oversee management.\nWe generally consider it good practice for\nindependent directors to make a majority of\nthe board, or in the case of controlled\ncompanies, at least one-third.

This director may\nchair the board, or, where the chair is also\nthe CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be\ndesignated as a lead independent director. The\nrole of this director is to enhance the\neffectiveness of the independent members of\nthe board through shaping the agenda, ensuring\nadequate information is provided to the board,\nand encouraging independent director\nparticipation in board deliberations. The lead\nindependent director or another appropriate\ndirector should be available to meet with\nshareholders in those situations where an\nindependent director is best placed to explain\nand contextualize a company\u2019s approach. There\nare matters for which the board has\nresponsibility that may involve a conflict of\ninterest for executives or for affiliated\ndirectors or require additional focus. It is\nour view that objective oversight of such\nmatters is best achieved when the board forms\ncommittees with a majority of independent\ndirectors, depending on market norms and a\ncompany\u2019s ownership structure. In many\nmarkets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in a\nvariety of experiences, perspectives, and\nskillsets in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans of promoting diversity of thought to\navoid \u201c group think \u201d in the board\u2019s exercise\nof its responsibilities to advise and oversee\nmanagement. In assessing board composition, we\ntake a case-by-case approach based on a\ncompany\u2019s board size, business model,\nstrategy, location and market capitalization.\nWe look for companies to explain how their\napproach to board composition supports the\ncompany\u2019s governance practices. We note that\nin many markets, policymakers have set board\ngender diversity goals which we may discuss\nwith companies, particularly if there is a\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. We ask boards to disclose,\nconsistent with local laws, how diversity,\nincluding professional and personal\ncharacteristics, is considered in board\ncomposition, given the company\u2019s long-term\nstrategy and business model. (12) Sufficient\ncapacity As the role and expectations of a\ndirector are increasingly demanding, directors\nmust be able to commit an appropriate amount\nof time to board and committee matters. It is\nimportant that directors have the capacity to\nmeet all of their responsibilities - including\nwhen there are unforeseen events \u2013 and\ntherefore, they should not take on an\nexcessive number of roles that would impair\ntheir ability to fulfill their duties.\nAuditors and audit-related issues BlackRock\nrecognizes the critical importance of\nfinancial statements, which should provide a\ntrue and fair picture of a company\u2019s financial\ncondition. Accordingly, we look for the\nassumptions made by management and reviewed by\nthe auditor in preparing the financial\nstatements to be reasonable and justified. The\naccuracy of financial statements, inclusive of\nfinancial and non-financial information as\nrequired or permitted under market-specific\naccounting rules, is of paramount importance\nto BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader\n\n(12) Personal characteristics may include, but\nare not limited to, gender; race/ethnicity;\ndisability; veteran status; LGBTQ+; and\nnational, Indigenous, religious, or cultural\nidentity.\n\nA-25\n\nrange of risks and opportunities have the\npotential to materially impact financial\nperformance. Over time, we anticipate\ninvestors and other users of company reporting\nwill increasingly seek to understand and\nscrutinize the assumptions underlying\nfinancial statements, particularly those that\npertain to the impact of the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy on a company\u2019s business\nmodel and asset mix. We recognize that this is\nan area of evolving practice and note that\ninternational standards setters, such as the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRS) Board and the International Auditing\nand Assurance Standards Board (IAASB),\ncontinue to develop their guidance to\ncompanies. (13) In this context, audit\ncommittees, or equivalent, play a vital role\nin a company\u2019s financial reporting system by\nproviding independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. (14) In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. Audit committees\nor equivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, we look for the fees earned to be\ndisclosed and explained. We look for Audit\ncommittees to have in place a procedure for\nassessing annually the independence of the\nauditor and the quality of the external audit\nprocess. Comprehensive disclosure provides\ninvestors with a sense of the company\u2019s long-\nterm operational risk management practices\nand, more broadly, the quality of the board\u2019s\noversight. We look to the audit or risk\ncommittee to periodically review the company\u2019s\nrisk assessment and risk management policies\nand the significant risks and exposures\nidentified by management, the internal\nauditors or the independent auditors and\nmanagement\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk. Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions The capital structure of a\ncompany is critical to shareholders as it\nimpacts the value of their investment and the\npriority of their interest in the company\nrelative to that of other equity or debt\ninvestors. Pre-emptive rights are a key\nprotection for shareholders against the\ndilution of their interests. Effective voting\nrights are basic rights of share ownership and\na core principle of effective governance.\nShareholders, as the residual claimants, have\nthe strongest interest in protecting the\nfinancial value of the company, and voting\nrights should match economic exposure, i.e.\none share, one vote. In principle, we disagree\nwith the creation of a share class with\nequivalent economic exposure and preferential,\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nthis structure violates the fundamental\ncorporate governance principle of\nproportionality and results in a concentration\nof power in the hands of a few shareholders,\nthus disenfranchising other shareholders and\namplifying any potential conflicts of\ninterest. However, we recognize that in\ncertain markets, at least for a period of\ntime, companies may have a valid argument for\nlisting dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally,\n\n(13) IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. (14) Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\nPlease see the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO), \u201c Enterprise Risk Management \u201d , 2023.\n\nA-26\n\nthey should seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. Executive\ncompensation is an important tool used by\ncompanies to support long-term financial value\ncreation. In our experience, well-structured\ncompensation policies reward the successful\ndelivery of strategic, operational, and/or\nfinancial goals, encourage an appropriate risk\nappetite, and align the interests of\nshareholders and executives through equity\nownership. We look for there to be a clear\nlink between variable pay and operational and\nfinancial performance. Performance metrics\nshould be stretching and aligned with a\ncompany\u2019s strategy and business model. BIS\ndoes not have a position on whether companies\nshould use sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but, where they are\nincluded, we look to companies to be as\nrigorous as they would be in setting other\nfinancial or operational targets. Long-term\nincentive plans should encompass timeframes\nthat 1) are distinct from annual executive\ncompensation structures and metrics, and 2)\nencourage the delivery of strong financial\nresults over a period of years. When\ndesigning, reviewing, and approving executive\ncompensation policies, board compensation\ncommittees \u2013 or board members responsible for\nsetting executive compensation \u2013 should\ncarefully consider the company\u2019s specific\ncircumstances, such as its risk profile, the\nenvironment in which it operates, and the\nindividuals the board is trying to attract,\nretain and incentivize. We look to the\ncompensation committees to guard against\ncontractual arrangements that would entitle\nexecutives to material compensation for early\ntermination of their employment. Finally,\npension contributions and other deferred\ncompensation arrangements should be reasonable\nin light of market practices or the company\u2019s\nbusiness and executive compensation\nstrategies. We are not supportive of one-off\nor special bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we appreciate disclosure relating\nto how and why the discretion was used, and\nhow the adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than also\nconsidering rigorous measures of\noutperformance. We encourage companies to\nclearly explain how compensation outcomes have\nrewarded performance. We encourage boards to\nconsider building clawback provisions into\nincentive plans such that companies could\nclawback compensation or require executives to\nforgo awards when compensation was based on\nfaulty financial statements or deceptive\nbusiness practices. We also favor recoupment\nfrom or the foregoing of the grant of any\nawards by any senior\n\nA-27\n\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. In our\nview, non-executive directors should be\ncompensated in a manner that is commensurate\nwith the time and effort expended in\nfulfilling their professional\nresponsibilities. Additionally, these\ncompensation arrangements should not risk\ncompromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. BIS may convey concerns\nthrough not supporting management\u2019s proposals\nto approve compensation, where they are on the\nagenda. We may also vote against members of\nthe compensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. (15) As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework that supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure\nallows investors to effectively evaluate\ncompanies\u2019 strategy and business practices\nrelated to material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities. We find it helpful\nwhen companies\u2019 disclosures demonstrate that\nthey have a resilient business model that\nintegrates material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities into their strategy,\nrisk management, and metrics and targets,\nincluding industry-specific metrics. The\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board\n(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2 (16) may\nprove helpful to companies in preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have both\nconverged under the ISSB. We recognize that\ncompanies may phase in reporting aligned with\nthe ISSB standards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, while we do not\nprescribe timelines regarding when companies\nmake these disclosures, we encourage them to\nproduce climate and other sustainability-\nrelated disclosures sufficiently in advance of\ntheir annual meeting, to the best of their\nabilities to provide investors with time to\nassess the data and make informed decisions.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. While not a voting\nitem, we find it helpful to our understanding\nof investment risk when companies disclose any\nrelevant global climate and other\nsustainability-related standards adopted, the\nindustry initiatives in which they\nparticipate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices.\n\n(15) By material sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk\nand financial value creation in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues include, but are not\nlimited to, water use, land use, waste\nmanagement, and climate risk. Examples of\nsocial issues include, but are not limited to,\nhuman capital management, impacts on the\ncommunities in which a company operates,\ncustomer loyalty, and relationships with\nregulators. (16) The objective of IFRS S1\nGeneral Requirements for Disclosure of\nSustainability-related Financial Information\nis to require an entity to disclose\ninformation about its sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity. The\nobjective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-28\n\nClimate and nature-related risk In our view,\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy is one\nof several mega forces reshaping markets. (17)\nOur research shows that the low-carbon\ntransition is a structural shift in the global\neconomy that will be shaped by changes in\ngovernment policies, technology, and consumer\nand investor preferences, which may be\nmaterial for many companies. (18) Yet the path\nto a low-carbon economy is uncertain and\nuneven, with different parts of the economy\nmoving at different speeds. BIS recognizes\nthat it can be challenging for companies to\npredict the impact of climate-related risk and\nopportunity on their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term financial value to\ninvestors. At companies where these climate-\nrelated risks are material, we find it helpful\nwhen they publicly disclose, consistent with\ntheir business model and sector, how they\nintend to deliver long-term financial\nperformance through the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, including where available,\ntheir transition plan. (19) In our experience,\ndisclosure consistent with the ISSB standards\nor the TCFD framework can help investors\nassess company-specific climate-related risks\nand opportunities, and inform investment\ndecisions. (20) Such disclosures also provide\ninvestors with insights into how companies are\nmanaging the risks associated with climate\nchange by managing their own carbon emissions\nor emissions intensities to the extent\nfinancially practicable. Recognizing the value\nof these disclosures, in some jurisdictions,\nlike the U.K, large companies must disclose\nsuch climate-related financial information on\na mandatory basis, while in other\njurisdictions these disclosures are viewed as\nbest practice in the market. Consistent with\nthe ISSB standards and the TCFD framework, we\nseek to understand, from company disclosures\nand engagement, the strategies companies have\nin place to manage material risks to, and\nopportunities for, their long-term business\nmodel associated with a range of climate-\nrelated scenarios. This includes a scenario in\nwhich global warming is limited to well below\n2\u00b0C, considering ambitions to achieve a limit\nof 1.5\u00b0C, the temperature goal recently\nreaffirmed by G20 members as part of the 2024\nLeader\u2019s Declaration. (21) These frameworks\nalso contemplate disclosures on how companies\nare setting short-, medium- and long-term\ntargets, ideally science-based where these are\navailable for their sector, for scope 1 and 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and\nto demonstrate how their targets are\nconsistent with the long-term financial\ninterests of their investors. While we\nrecognize that regulators in some markets are\nmoving to mandate certain disclosures, at this\nstage, we view scope 3 emissions differently\nfrom scopes 1 and 2, given methodological\ncomplexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns\nabout double-counting, and lack of direct\ncontrol by companies. We welcome disclosures\nand commitments companies choose to make\nregarding material scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s\n\n(17) BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Mega\nforces: An investment opportunity \u201d , 2023.\n(18) BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c\nTracking the low-carbon transition \u201d , July\n2023. (19) We have observed that more\ncompanies are developing such plans, and\npublic policymakers in a number of markets are\nsignaling their intentions to require them or\nalready have requirements in place, such as\nAustralia, Brazil, and the European Union. We\nview transition plans as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate its long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. Transition plans\nare building momentum internationally, with\nincreased focus from policy makers and\nsupervisors, including in the EU, UK, G7, G20,\nand from the financial industry. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for transition plans, there is no\nconsensus on the key elements these plans\nshould contain. We view useful disclosure as\none that communicates a company\u2019s approach to\nmanaging financially material business\nrelevant risks and opportunities \u2013 including\nclimate-related risks \u2013 to deliver long-term\nfinancial performance, which allows investors\nto make more informed decisions. While\ntransition plans can be helpful disclosure,\nBIS does not make the preparation and\nproduction of transition plans a voting issue.\nBIS may engage companies that have chosen to\npublish a transition plan to understand their\nplanned actions and resource implications.\n(20) BlackRock, \u201c Global perspectives on\ninvesting in the low-carbon transition \u201d ,\nJune 2023. We recognize that companies may\nphase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years, depending on\nlocal requirements. We also recognize and\nrespect that some companies may report using\ndifferent local standards, which may be\nrequired by regulation, or one of a number of\nvoluntary standards. In such cases, we ask\nthat companies disclose their rationale for\nreporting in line with the specific disclosure\nframework chosen and highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific. (21)\nIn November 2024, G20 members reaffirmed the\nParis Agreement temperature goal as part of\nthe Leader\u2019s Declaration . G20 members include\nthe world\u2019s major economies (19 countries and\ntwo regional bodies, the European Union and\nAfrican Union), representing 85% of global\nGross Domestic Product, over 75% of\ninternational trade, and about two-thirds of\nthe world population.\n\nA-29\n\nstrategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities. We rely on company\ndisclosures when determining how to vote on\nshareholder proposals addressing natural\ncapital issues. Our publicly available\ncommentary provides more information on our\napproach to natural capital. (22) Companies\u2019\nimpact on their workforce, supply chains, and\ncommunities In order to advance long-term\nshareholders\u2019 interests, companies should\nconsider the interests of the various parties\non whom they depend for their success over\ntime. It is for each company to determine\ntheir key stakeholders based on what is\nmaterial to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies discuss how they\nconsider the needs of their workforce today,\nand the skills required for their future\nbusiness strategy. We are also interested to\nunderstand how the board monitors and engages\non these matters, given it is well positioned\nto ensure that the approach taken by\nmanagement is informed by and aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s strategy. Companies should\narticulate how they address material adverse\nimpacts that could arise from their business\npractices and affect critical relationships\nwith their stakeholders. We encourage\ncompanies to implement, to the extent\nappropriate, monitoring processes (often\nreferred to as due diligence) to identify and\nmitigate potential adverse impacts and\ngrievance mechanisms to remediate any actual\nadverse material impacts. In our view,\nmaintaining trust within these relationships\ncan contribute to a company\u2019s long-term\nsuccess. Other corporate governance matters\nand shareholder protections In our view,\nshareholders have a right to material and\ntimely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. As a general\nprinciple, we believe shareholders should have\nthe right to vote on key corporate governance\nmatters, including changes to governance\nmechanisms, to submit proposals to the\nshareholders\u2019 meeting, and to call special\nmeetings of shareholders. Corporate form In\nour view, it is the responsibility of the\nboard to determine the corporate form that is\nmost appropriate given the company's purpose\nand business model. (23) Companies proposing\nto change their corporate form to a public\nbenefit corporation or similar entity should\nput it to a shareholder vote if not already\nrequired to do so under applicable law. We\nappreciate when supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form clearly explains\nhow the interests of shareholders and\ndifferent stakeholders would be impacted as\nwell as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. We generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\n(22) Given the growing awareness of the\nmateriality of these issues for certain\nbusinesses, enhanced reporting on a company's\nnatural capital dependencies and impacts would\naid investors\u2019 understanding. In our view, the\nfinal recommendations of the Taskforce on\nNature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)\nmay prove useful to some companies. We\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of other\nprivate sector standards. TNFD-aligned\nreporting is not a voting issue. (23)\nCorporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-30\n\nShareholder proposals In most markets in which\nBlackRock invests on behalf of clients,\nshareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on at a company\u2019s annual\nor extraordinary meeting, as long as\neligibility and procedural requirements are\nmet. The matters that we see put forward by\nshareholders address a wide range of topics,\nincluding governance reforms, capital\nmanagement, and improvements in the management\nor disclosure of sustainability-related risks.\nBlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. that place\nrestrictions and limitations on how BlackRock\ncan interact with the companies in which we\ninvest on behalf of our clients, including our\nability to submit shareholder proposals. We\ncan vote, on behalf of clients who authorize\nus to do so, on proposals put forth by others.\nWhen assessing shareholder proposals, we\nevaluate each proposal on its merit,\nconsidering the company\u2019s individual\ncircumstances and maintaining a singular focus\non the proposal\u2019s implications for long-term\nfinancial value creation. BIS\u2019 evaluation\nconsiders whether a shareholder proposal\naddresses a material risk that, if left\nunmanaged, may impact a company\u2019s long-term\nperformance. We look for consistency between\nthe specific request formally made in the\nproposal, the supporting documentation, and\nthe proponents\u2019 other communications on the\nissues. We also assess the company\u2019s practices\nand disclosures and the costs and benefits to\nthe company of meeting the request made in the\nproposal. We take into consideration a\ncompany\u2019s governance practices and disclosures\nagainst those of their peers. In our\nexperience, it is helpful when companies\ndisclose the names of the proponent or\norganization that has submitted or advised on\nthe proposal. We would not support proposals\nthat we believe would result in over-reaching\ninto the basic business decisions of the\ncompany, are unduly prescriptive or\nconstraining on management. We take into\nconsideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. BIS is likely to support\nshareholder proposals that request disclosures\nthat help us, as long-term investors on behalf\nof our clients, better understand the material\nrisks and opportunities companies face and how\nthey are managing them, especially where this\ninformation is additive given the company\u2019s\nexisting disclosures. We may also support\nshareholder proposals that are focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation. We recognize that some shareholder\nproposals bundle topics and/or specific\nrequests. Further, the proponent\u2019s supporting\nstatement may refer to topics that are not\ndirectly related to the request made in the\nproposal. In voting on behalf of clients, we\ndo not submit or edit proposals or the\nsupporting statements \u2013 we must vote yes or no\non the proposal as phrased by the proponent.\nTherefore, when we vote in support of a\nproposal, we are not necessarily endorsing\nevery element of the proposal or the\nreasoning, objectives, or supporting statement\nof the proponent. We may support a proposal\nfor different reasons from those put forth by\nthe proponent, when we believe that, overall,\nit can advance our clients' long-term\nfinancial interests. We typically explain to\nthe company our rationale for supporting such\nproposals. Alternatively, or in addition, we\nmay vote against the election of one or more\ndirectors if, in our assessment, the board has\nnot responded sufficiently or with an\nappropriate sense of urgency to a material\nrisk. We may also support a proposal if\nmanagement is on track, but we believe that\nvoting in favor might accelerate efforts to\naddress a material risk. BlackRock\u2019s oversight\nof its investment stewardship activities\nOversight BlackRock maintains advisory\ncommittees (Stewardship Advisory Committees),\ngenerally consisting of senior BlackRock index\ninvestment professionals and/or senior\nemployees with practical boardroom experience.\nThe Stewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines). The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees, the Investment Stewardship Global\nOversight Committee (Global Oversight\nCommittee) is a risk-focused committee,\ncomprised of the Global Head of Investment\nStewardship (Global Head), and senior\nBlackRock executives with legal, risk and\nother experience relevant to team oversight.\nThe Global Committee does not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS.\n\nA-31\n\nThe Global Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines. In\naddition, the Global Committee receives and\nreviews periodic reports regarding the votes\ncast by BIS, as well as updates on material\nprocess issues, procedural changes, and other\nrisk oversight considerations. The Global\nCommittee reviews these reports in an\noversight capacity as informed by the\nGuidelines. BIS carries out engagement with\ncompanies, executes proxy votes, and conducts\nvote operations (including maintaining records\nof votes cast) in a manner consistent with the\nrelevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts\nresearch on corporate governance issues and\nparticipates in industry discussions to\ncontribute to and keep abreast of important\ndevelopments in the corporate governance\nfield. BIS may utilize third parties for\ncertain of the foregoing activities and\nperforms oversight of those third parties. BIS\nmay discuss complicated or particularly\ncontroversial matters with senior specialists\ninternally, on an advisory basis, prior to\nmaking a voting decision. Voting guidelines\nand vote execution BlackRock votes on proxy\nissues when our clients authorize us to do so.\nWe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Principles.\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. The\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and updated\nas necessary to reflect changes in market\npractices, developments in corporate\ngovernance and feedback from companies and\nclients. In this way, BIS aims to maintain\npolicies that explain our approach to\ngovernance practices most aligned with\nclients\u2019 long-term financial interests. BIS\nanalysts may exercise their professional\njudgment in determining how to vote if they\nconclude that the Guidelines do not cover the\nspecific matter raised by a ballot item or\nthat an exception to the Guidelines would be\nin the long-term economic interests of\nBlackRock\u2019s clients. In certain markets, proxy\nvoting involves logistical issues which can\naffect BIS\u2019 ability to vote such proxies, as\nwell as the desirability of voting such\nproxies. These issues include, but are not\nlimited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder\nmeetings; ii) restrictions on a foreigner\u2019s\nability to exercise votes; iii) requirements\nto vote proxies in person; iv) \u201c share-\nblocking \u201d (requirements that investors who\nexercise their voting rights surrender the\nright to dispose of their holdings for some\nspecified period in proximity to the\nshareholder meeting); v) potential\ndifficulties in translating the proxy; vi)\nregulatory constraints; and vii) requirements\nto provide local agents with unrestricted\npowers of attorney to facilitate voting\ninstructions. We are not supportive of\nimpediments to the exercise of voting rights\nsuch as share-blocking or overly burdensome\nadministrative requirements. BlackRock votes\nproxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Voting Choice BlackRock offers\nVoting Choice a program that provides eligible\nclients with more opportunities to participate\nin the proxy voting process where legally and\noperationally viable.\n\nA-32\n\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize certain\nequity index investment strategies, as well as\neligible clients in certain institutional\npooled funds in the U.S., UK, and Canada that\nuse systematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nIn addition, institutional clients in\nseparately managed accounts (SMAs) continue to\nbe eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice\nregardless of their investment strategies.\n(24) BlackRock also launched a U.S. Program to\noffer proxy voting to eligible shareholder\naccounts in a U.S. Fund. (25) As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nOur clients have greater control over proxy\nvoting because of Voting Choice. BlackRock\ndoes not disclose client information,\nincluding a client\u2019s selection of proxy\npolicy, without client consent. Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures BIS\nmaintains policies and procedures that seek to\nprevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy\nvoting activity. Such influence might stem\nfrom any relationship between the investee\ncompany (or any shareholder proponent or\ndissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird- party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors\n\n(24) With Voting Choice, SMAs have the ability\nto select from a set of voting policies from\nthird-party proxy advisers the policy that\nbest aligns with their views and preferences.\nBlackRock can then use its proxy voting\ninfrastructure to cast votes based on the\nclient\u2019s selected voting policy. (25) Read\nmore about BlackRock Voting Choice on our\nwebsite .\n\nA-33\n\n\u2022 public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary duty as an\nasset manager to our clients in helping them\nachieve their investment goals. While this has\noccurred in a limited number of cases, the\ndecision to recall securities on loan as part\nof BlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). (26) BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Reporting and vote transparency We\nare committed to transparency in the\nstewardship work we do on behalf of clients.\nWe inform clients about our engagement and\nvoting policies and activities through direct\ncommunication and through disclosure on our\nwebsite. Additionally, we make public our\nregional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals and on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant\n\n(26) Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-34\n\ninterest to clients, we may publish a vote\nbulletin after the meeting, disclosing and\nexplaining our vote on key proposals. We also\npublish a quarterly list of all companies with\nwhich we engaged and the key topics addressed\nin the engagement meeting. In this way, we\nhelp inform our clients about the work we do\non their behalf in promoting the governance\nand business practices that support durable,\nlong-term financial value creation by\ncompanies.

We consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to be an informed, engaged\nshareholder on their behalf, given the\nbusiness decisions that companies make have a\ndirect impact on our clients\u2019 long-term\ninvestment outcomes and financial well-being.\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a\ndedicated function within BlackRock, which\nserves as a link between BlackRock\u2019s clients\nand the companies we invest in on their\nbehalf. BIS takes a long-term approach in our\nstewardship efforts, reflecting the investment\nhorizons of the majority of our clients. BIS\ndoes this through: 1. Engaging with companies\nin a two-way dialogue to build our\nunderstanding of a company\u2019s practices and\ninform our voting decisions. 2. Voting at\nshareholder meetings on management and\nshareholder proposals on behalf of clients who\nhave delegated voting authority to BlackRock.\n3. Contributing to industry dialogue on\nstewardship to share our perspectives on\nmatters that may impact our clients\u2019\ninvestments. 4. Reporting on our activities to\ninform clients about our stewardship efforts\non their behalf through a range of\npublications and direct reporting. Stewardship\nfor clients with investment objectives\nrelating to the low-carbon transition\nBlackRock offers a wide range of investment\nproducts and funds to support our clients\u2019\nunique and varied investment objectives, and\nin February 2024, BlackRock announced it would\nbe launching a new decarbonization stewardship\noption for those clients who explicitly direct\nBlackRock to invest their assets with\ndecarbonization investment objectives. An\nincreasing number of clients are seeking to\nminimize the financial risk, and maximize the\nfinancial opportunities, associated with the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, and thus\nare interested in sustainable and transition\ninvesting, with some including decarbonization\nas an investment objective in their mandates\nwith BlackRock. In Europe for example, all of\nour largest, strategic relationship clients\nhave net zero commitments for their\norganizations, and globally a growing number\nhave made similar commitments, which those\nclients believe, will shape financial\nopportunities in the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. A survey of 200 institutional\ninvestors globally, representing nearly $9tn\nin assets under management, indicated that 98%\nof them have set some kind of transition\ninvestment objective for their portfolios.\nThese guidelines set out BIS\u2019 approach to\nvoting at companies\u2019 shareholder meetings on\nbehalf of funds with explicit decarbonization\nor climate-related investment objectives, and,\nwhen appropriate, engagement with corporate\nleadership to support our voting on clients\u2019\nbehalf. In addition, clients in separately\nmanaged accounts may instruct BlackRock to\napply these guidelines to their holdings. Both\nin the case of funds and separately managed\naccounts, these guidelines are only\nimplemented upon explicit selection and\napproval by the applicable fund board or\nclient. These guidelines should be read in\nconjunction with BIS\u2019 benchmark policies and\nare focused on matters related to climate\nrisks and the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy at companies that are held by funds\nand clients who have selected these\nguidelines. These guidelines differ from the\nbenchmark policies in that they consider, in\naddition to financial considerations and\nconsistent with the investment objective of\neach fund or account that has selected these\nguidelines, the alignment of companies\u2019\nbusiness model and strategies with the\nfinancial opportunities presented by the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and the\nmore ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,\nnamely to limit average temperature rise to\n1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. These\nguidelines will apply to companies which\nproduce goods and services that contribute to\nreal world decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low-carbon transition, based\non reported and estimated scopes 1, 2, and 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. We estimate these\ncompanies represent the vast majority of the\n\nA-36\n\nvalue chain emissions of the companies held by\nfunds and clients that have selected these\nguidelines. For all other companies held by\nthese funds and clients, BIS\u2019 benchmark voting\nguidelines apply. On other matters not related\nto climate risks and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, BIS will apply our benchmark\npolicies. For clients who have not directed\nBlackRock to prioritize climate risks and\ndecarbonization as an investment objective,\nBIS will continue to undertake our stewardship\nresponsibilities in line with our benchmark\npolicies, with a sole focus on advancing those\nclients\u2019 long-term economic interests. This\nwill include consideration of climate-related\nrisks and opportunities in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model, where material to the\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial returns. Please see appendix 2,\nwhich sets out the key differences between the\nBIS benchmark and decarbonization policies on\nitems related to climate risk and the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy.\nUnderstanding the investment implications of\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy\nResearch from the BlackRock Investment\nInstitute (BII) highlights that changing\ngovernment policy, technology, and consumer\nand investor preferences are driving the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, but these\nforces are moving at uneven speeds across\nsectors and regions. For example\u2014some\ntechnologies like renewable power are already\nbeing deployed at scale in some regions, while\nin other sectors and regions less cost-\neffective low-carbon alternatives exist. We\nhave heard from certain clients that they see\nthe low-carbon transition as a series of\nshifts over decades that will reshape\nproduction and consumption, spur significant\ncapital investment and create risks,\nopportunities and a wider range of financial\nand competitive outcomes for companies. For\nclients interested in investing in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nunderstanding its corresponding risks and\nopportunities, we have developed the BlackRock\nInvestment Institute Transition Scenario\n(BIITS), powered by Aladdin \u00ae technology.\nBIITS is a research-based, analytical forecast\nof how the low-carbon transition is most\nlikely to play out based on what we know and\nexpect today. It can help inform a top-down\nassessment of a company\u2019s business risk\narising from the transition. BII based its key\nassumptions on rigorous research, and the\ninput of BlackRock\u2019s portfolio managers and\nother experts. For client assets with explicit\ninvestment objectives related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, BIS will\ndraw on the insights generated by BIITS and\nAladdin \u00ae Climate, as well as our own analysis\nand engagement, in applying these guidelines.\nIn doing so, we will take into consideration\nthe fact that the necessary data to assess\nindividual companies currently has\nlimitations, but is improving as a result of\ndisclosure requirements in an increasing\nnumber of jurisdictions. Decarbonization\nstewardship guidelines design principles The\nframework of these guidelines is designed to:\n\u2022 Prioritize sectors and companies that are\ncritical to the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy: This includes companies which produce\ngoods and services that contribute to real\nworld decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low-carbon transition. \u2022\nApply a sectoral approach to our analysis that\nacknowledges the unevenness of the low-carbon\ntransition across sectors and markets: We take\ninto consideration the varying speeds at which\nsectors and markets can decarbonize based on\ntechnological feasibility, consumer demand,\ngovernment policy, regulatory frameworks and\nother factors. Further, we recognize that\nthese factors are uncertain and dynamic, which\nwill require that we evolve our approach as\nnecessary. \u2022 Take a long-term, pragmatic\napproach that favors a transition that\nminimizes disruption to companies and their\nkey stakeholders: Our approach recognizes the\nchallenges that many companies face in\nadapting their business models. It is premised\non the views of interested clients that a\ntransition where companies adapt and continue\nto deliver financial returns throughout, is a\nbetter long-term investment outcome for them,\nand less disruptive to a company\u2019s other key\nstakeholders, than a transition that is\nuneven. Further, we consider the differences\nbetween the actions and outcomes over which\ncompany management has influence, and those it\ndoes not. \u2022 Focus on useful, contextualized\ndisclosures that help inform investors views,\nwhile recognizing data limitations: The policy\nwill seek disclosures that outline key\nmilestones and dependencies underpinning the\ncompany\u2019s low-carbon transition strategy;\nexplain the trade-offs required to adapt the\nbusiness model; and include relevant data and\nnarrative.\n\nA-37\n\n\u2022 Be consistent with our position as a\nminority investor on behalf of our clients:\nThe boards and executive leadership of\ncompanies determine a company\u2019s strategy and\nits implementation. We make decisions on how\nto engage companies and vote proxies\nindependently, based on our professional\njudgment of the priorities and outcomes most\naligned with clients\u2019 investment objectives.\nVoting guidelines Consistent with the\ninvestment objective of each fund or client\nthat has selected these guidelines, BIS will\nlook to companies to demonstrate the\nfollowing: Corporate Disclosures In the\ncontext of these guidelines, we look for\ncompanies to provide sufficient corporate\ndisclosure to allow us to determine the extent\nto which decarbonization and the low-carbon\ntransition are strategic priorities. As a\ngeneral point, we would expect companies that\nhave disclosed their aim to participate in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy to make\ndisclosures that help explain the strategy and\ngovernance systems they have determined most\nappropriate, which may include: (1) a low-\ncarbon transition strategy to demonstrate\ntheir alignment with the ambition to limit\nglobal average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels. This would normally\nmean that they have a long-term strategy to\nachieve net- zero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions by 2050, with appropriate near- and\nmedium-term milestones to assess their\nprogress. (2) low-carbon transition-related\nreporting consistent with the standards\ndeveloped by the International Sustainability\nStandards Board (ISSB). IFRS S1 addresses the\ngeneral requirements of sustainability\nreporting and IFRS S2 sets out the disclosures\nthat would provide investors with decision-\nuseful information about a company\u2019s most\nsignificant climate- and low-carbon\ntransition-related risks and opportunities. As\naudit and assurance standards are developed,\nit would be helpful to investors\u2019 confidence\nin such disclosures for companies to seek\nindependent, third-party assurance. (3) scope\n1 and scope 2, and material scope 3 GHG\nemissions. In addition, we look to companies\nto disclose their reduction targets for scope\n1 and 2 emissions, science-based where\npossible. We welcome disclosure of targets or\nindicative goals, where companies have set\nthem, for scope 3 emissions reductions,\nrecognizing that these would be provided on a\n\u2018best efforts\u2019 basis given the methodological\nchallenges these currently present for\nreporters. Scope 3 information, including how\na company is working with its value chain to\naccelerate reductions in GHG intensity,\nprovides useful insight to investors focused\non investing in the low-carbon transition and\nunderstanding the impact of their investments\non their decarbonization goals. However, we\nrecognize that companies have varying ability\nto influence the emissions across the\ndifferent parts of their value chain and it is\nhelpful when disclosures explain the\nimplications for the achievement of their\ndecarbonization targets. Transition plans Some\ncompanies have published a transition plan\nthat explains how the company intends to\nimplement its low-carbon transition strategy\nby, as defined by the ISSB, \u201c lay[ing] out the\nentity\u2019s targets, actions or resources for its\ntransition towards a lower-carbon economy,\nincluding actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions \u201d (see appendix 1).\nWe note the work being undertaken in a number\nof jurisdictions on establishing a common\napproach in a market to corporate transition\nplans. Given this work continues, for the\nnear-term, BIS will not make preparation and\nproduction of transition plans a voting issue.\nBIS may engage companies that have chosen to\npublish a transition plan to understand their\nplanned actions and resource implications in\naccordance with anticipated requirements.\nBoards and directors An effective and well-\nfunctioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the company\u2019s\nability to deliver on its low-carbon\ntransition strategy. In assessing the role and\neffectiveness of the board in this regard, we\nseek to understand whether: \u2022 The board has\nclear oversight responsibilities for climate\nand low-carbon transition-related risks and\nopportunities in the company\u2019s business model.\nWe consider the whole board to have\nresponsibility for oversight of the company\u2019s\nlong- term strategy, including those aspects\nrelated to the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy.\n\nA-38\n\n\u2022 Management has established a robust low-\ncarbon transition framework and long-term\nstrategy, with clear accountability for\ndelivery by senior executives. \u2022 The capital\nmanagement strategy explains how the company\nallocates investments to (traditional and next\ngeneration) business lines and innovation, and\nreturns cash to shareholders, consistent with\nthe low-carbon transition strategy. \u2022 The\nclimate and low-carbon transition risks most\nlikely to significantly impact the business\nare integrated into the company\u2019s enterprise\nrisk management processes and reporting. \u2022 The\ncompany has set scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions\nreduction targets, science-based and\nindependently verified where possible, against\na baseline, that are consistent with the\nambition to limit average temperature rise to\nno more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels. \u2022 There is a clear link between the\ncompany\u2019s scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions reduction\ntargets over time and its long-term low-carbon\ntransition strategy. \u2022 The company is\nmonitoring its material scope 3 emissions and\ndisclosing these where it is confident in the\ndata. Given forthcoming regulatory\nrequirements in certain jurisdictions, some\ncompanies are voluntarily disclosing scope 3\nemissions reductions targets and plans,\nsetting out how they are working on\ndecarbonization with the different\nconstituents in their value chain. \u2022 The board\noversees, and management has a formalized\napproach to, the company\u2019s lobbying\nactivities, including trade association\nmemberships. Policy engagement should be\nconsistent with a company\u2019s stated strategic\npolicy objectives, including those related to\nthe low-carbon transition. Voting against\ndirectors over concerns about climate risk In\nimplementing these guidelines, BIS will\ngenerally support non-executive directors\nstanding for election where, in BIS\u2019\nassessment based on company disclosures and\nengagement, a company is executing on its\ncommitment to align with the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, as defined above. Where\nBIS determines this is not the case, we may\nvote against the election of one or more\ndirectors who have responsibility for the\nissue. The directors most likely to be in\nfocus are the chair of the board sub-committee\nwith low-carbon transition, climate or\nsustainability risk oversight\nresponsibilities, other members of the\nrelevant committee, the lead independent\ndirector or the non-executive chair of the\nboard. In certain markets, we may withhold\nsupport for the discharge of the supervisory\nboard or equivalent. Where we have not\nsupported director elections over climate\nconcerns in a prior year, and the company has\nnot subsequently made progress towards\naligning with the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, we may escalate by voting against the\nre-election of additional responsible\ndirectors to signal our heightened concerns.\nManagement proposals to approve a climate\nstrategy or progress report In certain\nmarkets, company management may submit\nproposals asking shareholders to approve their\nclimate action plans or progress reports,\nsometimes known as \u201c Say on Climate. \u201d BIS\nwill generally support management\u2019s climate\nstrategy proposal if, in our assessment based\non these guidelines, the strategy is aligned\nwith the low-carbon transition. Similarly, we\nwill generally support management\u2019s proposal\non a progress report if the company has\nclearly explained its progress against, and\nany deviations from or changes to, its stated\ntransition plan and targets. Shareholder\nproposals on climate and low-carbon transition\nmatters Shareholder proposals on a company\u2019s\napproach to the low-carbon transition or\nclimate risk will be considered on their\nmerit. Our assessment will take into\nconsideration the implications for, and the\nrelevance to, the company\u2019s stated low-carbon\ntransition strategy and targets. We may\nsupport shareholder proposals that, for\nexample, ask a company to: \u2022 Publish a\nbusiness plan, and related disclosures,\nconsistent with the ambition to limit average\ntemperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels \u2022 Align their scope 1\nand 2 GHG emissions reduction targets to,\nand/or discuss how their targets align with, a\nlong-term goal of the company achieving net\nzero GHG emissions by 2050 \u2022 Disclose the\ncategories of scope 3 GHG emissions most\nmaterial to a company\u2019s business model \u2022\nImprove disclosures on how a company\u2019s\nclimate-related lobbying (including trade\nassociation memberships and other indirect\nlobbying) is aligned with its strategic policy\npositions.\n\nA-39\n\nWe would not support shareholder proposals\nthat seek to constrain board or management\ndecision-making or direct specific business or\nstrategic decisions. This includes proposals\nthat seek to change a company\u2019s articles of\nassociation or charter to require commitments\nor actions related to climate risk or the low-\ncarbon transition. Related matters There are\nother business items not covered above that\nmay be put to a shareholder vote that could\naddress matters relevant to the transition to\na low-carbon economy. Under these guidelines,\nBIS is most likely to engage, where\nappropriate, if we seek to enhance our\nunderstanding of a company\u2019s approach.\nGenerally, our voting on these matters would\nbe covered by BIS\u2019 benchmark guidelines.\nExecutive compensation We look to company\nboards to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. Some companies, in\nlight of their long-term strategy, may decide\nto include relevant GHG emissions reduction\ntargets or low-carbon transition-related\nmetrics in their incentive plans. In such\ncases, BIS would engage to understand the\nalignment between those metrics and the\ncompany\u2019s stated climate strategy. Auditors\nand audit-related issues For companies with\nmaterial climate or transition risks or\nopportunities in their business models, BIS is\ninterested to understand whether the company\nconsiders and, if relevant, quantifies, and\naccounts for material climate-related risks in\nits financial statements, including if the\ncompany explains such risks within the context\nof its audit report. We note that work is\nbeing undertaken to develop audit and\nassurance standards in relation to climate and\ntransition reporting, which may impact the\nfuture reporting requirements of companies. We\nnote that assurance of corporate disclosures\nrelated to climate risk and the transition to\na low-carbon economy is still nascent.\nMergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other\nspecial situations Special situations will be\nconsidered on their financial merits, but BIS\nmay engage on climate-related factors under\nthese guidelines where a transaction may\nsignificantly alter a company\u2019s climate\nstrategy or a shareholder activist has\nproposed governance, strategic or operational\nchanges that may impact its climate strategy.\nBIS does not promote changes in corporate\ncontrol, nor does it invoke formal governance\nmechanisms that rise to the level of\nshareholder activism. Other business relevant\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nClimate risk and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy are interconnected with a\nnumber of other sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities that may be relevant to a\ncompany\u2019s business model and long-term\nperformance. These include a company\u2019s impacts\nor dependencies on natural capital and key\nstakeholders. In the context of these\nguidelines, we may engage companies to better\nunderstand how they are managing the impact on\npeople (e.g., employees, suppliers, customers\nand communities) of any strategic or\noperational changes they are making in\nrelation to their transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Similarly, we may engage companies\nthat face risks and opportunities related to\nland use and deforestation, access to fresh\nwater, or the ability to secure scarce\nresources critical to the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Appendix 1 Terminology We\nunderstand the key concepts referred to within\nthese guidelines as follows: Climate risk:\nIncludes physical risk, the increased risk to\ncompanies\u2019 assets and activities caused by the\ndirect impact of changing weather patterns and\nnatural catastrophes, and transition risk, the\nimpact of the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy on a company\u2019s long-term\nprofitability. Transition to a low-carbon\neconomy ( \u201c low-carbon transition \u201d ): The\nglobal economic shift toward lower emissions\nacross many sectors and business models. The\neconomic transformation is being driven by\nchanges in government policy, technology, and\nconsumer and investor preferences, as well as\nthe physical effects of climate change (e.g.,\nextreme weather), and can potentially have a\nmaterial impact on clients\u2019 investments and\nportfolios.\n\nA-40\n\nDecarbonization: the process of reducing or\neliminating emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)\nfrom human activity and removing carbon\ncurrently in the atmosphere. This can be\ncarried out by countries, companies and even\nindividual consumers. Sometimes the concept is\nunderstood to include the reduction and\nelimination of other GHG, e.g., methane.\nClimate-related risks and opportunities: The\ninvestment opportunities and risks associated\nwith the transition to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding transition risks and opportunities\nand physical risks and opportunities in\nadapting to physical climate change. Climate-\nrelated transition plan: \u201c An aspect of an\nentity\u2019s overall strategy that lays out the\nentity\u2019s targets, actions or resources for its\ntransition towards a lower-carbon economy,\nincluding actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. \u201d Science-based GHG\nemissions reduction targets: Targets that \u201c\n\u2026are in line with what the latest climate\nscience deems necessary to meet the goals of\nthe Paris Agreement \u2013 limiting global warming\nto 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Science-\nbased targets give companies a clearly defined\npath to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in\nline with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThey define how much and how quickly a\nbusiness must reduce its emissions to be in\nline with the Paris Agreement goals. \u201d\nAppendix 2 Comparison of key differences\nbetween how the BIS benchmark considers\nclimate-related risks, where appropriate, and\nthe decarbonization guidelines\n                                              \n                BIS Benchmark  Decarbonizat\u2026  \n                Policy         Policy         \n                               Considers      \n                               both           \n                Focuses on     financial      \n                financial      performance    \n                performance    anddecarboni\u2026  \n                andengages     objectives     \n                companies on   consistent     \n                climate        withfunds'     \n                andtransition  and clients'   \n                topics when    investment     \n                material to    objectivesAs\u2026  \n  Key concepts  theirbusiness  the alignment  \n                Prioritizes    of a           \n                the            company'sbus\u2026  \n                disclosure of  model with     \n                how acompany   the ambition   \n                is managing    to             \n                material       limitglobal    \n                climate        average        \n                andtransitio\u2026  temperature    \n                risks and      rise to        \n                opportunities  1.5\u00b0Cabove     \n                               pre-industri\u2026  \n                               levels         \n                               Largest total  \n  Prioritized   Largest Scope  value chain    \n  companies     1 and 2 GHG    GHG            \n  forclimate-\u2026  emitters       emitters(Sco\u2026  \n                               1, 2, & 3)     \n                Seeks          Seeks          \n  Emissions     reporting of   reporting of   \n  reporting     Scope 1 & 2    Scope 1, 2     \n                               and material3  \n  Emissions     Seeks the      Seeks Scope 1  \n  targets       disclosure of  & 2 targets    \n  &decarboniz\u2026  Scope 1 & 2    and            \n  efforts       targets        assessesdeca\u2026  \n                               efforts        \n                Seeks                         \n                disclosure     Assesses       \n  Temperature   from           temperature    \n  &             companies      and            \n  scenarioali\u2026  thatidentifi\u2026  scenarioalig\u2026  \n  /             and discusses  to 1.5\u00b0C       \n  pathways      the most       degrees        \n                plausibledec\u2026                 \n                pathway                       \n                               Seeks          \n                               science-based  \n                Engagement     targets        \n  Science-bas\u2026  topic but not  andverificat\u2026  \n  targetscomm\u2026  vote           where          \n  &verificati\u2026  escalationcr\u2026  possible; may  \n                               takevoting     \n                               action where   \n                               absent         \n                               Assesses       \n                               activities     \n                Engagement     benefitting    \n  Company\u2019s     topic but not  from           \n  role in       vote           and/orcontri\u2026  \n  thetransiti\u2026  escalationcr\u2026  to the         \n                               transition to  \n                               a low-carbon   \n                               economy        \n                Case-by-case   Case-by-case   \n                approach with  approach with  \n                focus          furtherconsi\u2026  \n                onimplicatio\u2026  given to       \n                for long-term  decarbonizat\u2026  \n                financial      in addition    \n  Shareholder   valuecreatio\u2026  to             \n  proposals     support for    financialper\u2026  \n                shareholder    support for    \n                proposals      shareholder    \n                thatseek to    proposals      \n                direct         thatseek to    \n                management     direct         \n                strategy       management     \n                               strategy       \n                                              \nA-41\n\nWant to know more? blackrock.com/stewardship |\ncontactstewardship@blackrock.com This document\nis provided for information and educational\npurposes only.
