This Example is intended\nto help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that\nyou invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated\nand then sell all of your shares\nat the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each\nyear and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs\nmay be higher or lower, based on\nthese assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $18         $58     $101      $230  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 29%\nof the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe iBoxx MSCI ESG Advanced USD\nLiquid Investment Grade Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\ndeveloped by Markit Indices\nLimited (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c Markit \u201d ) with\nenvironmental, social and\ngovernance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) rating\ninputs from MSCI ESG Research LLC\n( \u201c MSCI ESG Research \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is designed to\napply climate-based and values-\nbased screens to the Markit iBoxx\nUSD Liquid Investment Grade Index\n(the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), and also\nis designed to select issuers\nwith average or above ESG ratings\nrelative to their sector peers,\nas identified by MSCI ESG\nResearch. The Underlying Index is\na modified market value weighted\nindex with a cap on each issuer\nof 3% of the Underlying Index at\neach monthly rebalancing. The\nParent Index is designed to\nreflect the performance of U.S.\ndollar denominated investment\ngrade corporate bonds that: (i)\nare issued by companies domiciled\nin countries classified as\ndeveloped markets by Markit; (ii)\nhave an average rating of\ninvestment grade (ratings from\nFitch Ratings, Inc., Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc. or\nStandard & Poor\u2019s \u00ae Global\nRatings, a subsidiary of S&P\nGlobal ( \u201c S&P Global Ratings \u201d )\nare considered; if more than one\nagency provides a rating, the\naverage rating is attached to the\nbond); (iii) have at least $750\nmillion of outstanding face value\nfor the specific bond issue; (iv)\nare from issuers with at least $2\nbillion outstanding face value of\nall of the issuer's bonds\neligible for inclusion in the\nParent Index; and (v) have at\nleast three years to maturity at\nrebalance (three years and six\nmonths to maturity for new index\ninsertions). To construct the\nUnderlying Index, Markit begins\nwith the Parent Index and then\napplies a series of climate-based\nand values-based screens. The\nclimate-based screens remove\nissuers with an industry tie to\nfossil fuels ( e.g. , thermal S-2\n\ncoal, oil, and gas) including\nreserve ownership, related\nrevenues and power generation (as\ndetermined by MSCI ESG Research);\nissuers classified by IHS Markit\nin the Oil and Gas Market Sector;\nand issuers with low MSCI\nEnvironmental controversies\nscores (in this instance, below\ntwo (2)). The values-based\nscreens remove controversial\nbusiness activities (as\ndetermined by MSCI ESG Research)\nincluding adult entertainment,\nalcohol, civilian firearms,\ncontroversial weapons,\nconventional weapons, for-profit\nprisons, gambling, genetically\nmodified organisms, nuclear\npower, nuclear weapons, palm oil,\npredatory lending, and tobacco\nbased on revenue or percentage of\nrevenue thresholds for certain\ncategories ( e.g., $500 million\nor 50%) and categorical\nexclusions for others ( e.g .,\nnuclear weapons). The values-\nbased screens also remove issuers\nviolating the United Nations\nGlobal Compact. Additionally, the\nIndex Provider removes issuers\nwith a MSCI ESG rating below BBB\nand issuers with a low MSCI ESG\ncontroversies score (in this\ninstance, below one (1)). To\ndetermine if companies are\ninvolved in ESG controversies,\nMSCI ESG Research assesses the\npossible negative environmental,\nsocial, and/or governance impact\nof a company\u2019s operations or\nproducts on a scale from 0 to 10,\nwith 0 being the most severe\ncontroversy rating. To determine\nif companies are involved in\nenvironmental controversies, MSCI\nESG Research assesses the\npossible impact of a company\u2019s\noperations or products in\nenvironmental issues such as\nenergy and climate change, land\nuse and biodiversity, toxic\nemissions and waste, water stress\nand operational waste. The impact\nis rated on a scale from 0 to 10,\nwith 0 being the most severe\ncontroversy rating. To determine\nESG ratings, MSCI ESG Research\nrates the ESG characteristics of\nsecurities on a scale of \u201c CCC \u201d\n(lowest) to \u201c AAA \u201d (highest).\nMSCI ESG Research evaluates a\ncompany\u2019s risks and opportunities\nusing a sector specific ESG Key\nIssues ( \u201c Key Issues \u201d ) ( e.g.\n, carbon emissions) selection and\nweighting model. Each company is\nscored on a scale of 0 to 10,\nwith 10 being the highest, for\neach Key Issue before being\nprovided an ESG rating based on\naverage Key Issue score. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced on\na monthly basis, on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index\nis represented by securities of\ncompanies in the financials and\nhealthcare industries or sectors.\nThe components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. As of February 29, 2024,\nthe Underlying Index was\ncomprised of 1,793 components.\nBFA uses an indexing approach to\ntry to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the\nindex it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions\nwhen markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. S-3 BFA\nuses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the\nFund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that\ninvolves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has\nan investment profile similar to\nthat of an applicable underlying\nindex. The securities selected\nare expected to have, in the\naggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors\nsuch as market value and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability, duration ( i.e. , a\nsecurity's price sensitivity to a\nchange in interest rates),\nmaturity or credit ratings and\nyield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or\nmay not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund will invest at\nleast 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of the\nUnderlying Index, and the Fund\nwill invest at least 90% of its\nassets in fixed income securities\nof the types included in the\nUnderlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. The Fund\nwill invest no more than 10% of\nits assets in futures, options,\nand swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index as well as\nin fixed income securities other\nthan the types included in the\nUnderlying Index, but which BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments\nassociated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part\nof that position for the purposes\nof calculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks\nto track the investment results\nof the Underlying Index before\nfees and expenses of the Fund.\nThe Fund may lend securities\nrepresenting up to one-third of\nthe value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of\nany collateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is sponsored by\nMarkit, MSCI ESG Research, or\ntheir affiliates, which are\nindependent of the Fund and BFA.\nThe Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities), repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities, and\nsecurities of state or municipal\ngovernments and their political\nsubdivisions are not considered\nto be issued by members of any\nindustry. Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail\nthat of other investments.The\nFund is subject to certain risks,\nincluding the principal risks\nnoted below, any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund's net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d\n), trading price, yield, total\nreturn and ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with\nothers following in alphabetical\norder), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may S-4\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Credit Risk . Debt\nissuers and other counterparties\nmay be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or\notherwise honor their\nobligations. Changes in an\nissuer\u2019s credit rating or the\nmarket\u2019s perception of an\nissuer\u2019s creditworthiness may\nalso adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investment in that\nissuer. The degree of credit risk\ndepends on an issuer's or\ncounterparty's financial\ncondition and on the terms of an\nobligation. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk refers to\nfluctuations in the value of a\nfixed-income security due to\nchanges in the general level of\ninterest rates. An increase in\ninterest rates generally will\ncause the value of fixed-income\nsecurities to decline. Securities\nwith longer maturities generally\nare more sensitive to interest\nrate changes and subject to\ngreater fluctuations in value.\nChanges in interest rates may\nhave unpredictable effects on\nfixed-income markets and result\nin heightened market volatility\nand lower liquidity for certain\ninstruments, all of which may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Interest rate\nchanges can be sudden and\nunpredictable and are influenced\nby a number of factors, including\ngovernment policy, monetary\npolicy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index\nuses criteria related to the ESG\ncharacteristics of issuers, this\nmay limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities\navailable to the Fund and, as a\nresult, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying\nindex does not use ESG criteria.\nThe Underlying Index\u2019s use of ESG\ncriteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating\ngreater weight to, securities or\nmarket sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or\nunderperform other funds that use\nESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling\nmay result in divergence of the\nFund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from\nthose of the Underlying Index.\nThe Index Provider may evaluate\nsecurity-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or\nconstraints that are relevant to\nthe Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances.\nSecurities included in the\nUnderlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria\nbut may nevertheless remain in\nthe Underlying Index and the Fund\nuntil the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider.\nAs a result, certain securities\nin the Underlying Index, or the\nUnderlying Index as a whole, may\nnot meet the relevant ESG\nobjectives or constraints at all\ntimes. Income Risk. The Fund's\nincome may decline if interest\nrates fall. This decline in\nincome can occur because the Fund\nmay subsequently invest in lower-\nyielding bonds as bonds in its\nportfolio mature, are near\nmaturity or are called, bonds in\nthe Underlying Index are\nsubstituted, or the Fund\notherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds. Market Risk .\nThe Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional\nor global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or\nother events S-5 could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes. Assets\nUnder Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, or another fund\nmay invest in the Fund and hold\nits investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund\nto achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Call Risk . During\nperiods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of a callable\nbond held by the Fund may \u201c call\n\u201d or repay the security before\nits stated maturity, and the Fund\nmay have to reinvest the proceeds\nin securities with lower yields,\nwhich would result in a decline\nin the Fund's income, or in\nsecurities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable\nfeatures. S-6 Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Cybersecurity Risk\n. Failures or breaches of the\nelectronic systems of the Fund,\nits adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or\nissuers of assets in which the\nFund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans and risk management systems\nseeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems. The Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund.\nFinancials Sector Risk . The\nperformance of companies in the\nfinancials sector may be\nadversely impacted by many\nfactors, including, among others,\nchanges in government\nregulations, economic conditions,\nand interest rates, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public\nperception, exposure\nconcentration and decreased\nliquidity in credit markets. The\nimpact of changes in regulation\nof any individual financial\ncompany, or of the financials\nsector as a whole, cannot be\npredicted. Cybersecurity\nincidents and technology\nmalfunctions and failures have\nbecome increasingly frequent and\nhave caused significant losses to\ncompanies in this sector, which\nmay negatively impact the Fund.\nGeographic Risk . A natural\ndisaster could occur in a\ngeographic region in which the\nFund invests, which could\nadversely affect the economy or\nthe business operations of\ncompanies in the specific\ngeographic region, causing an\nadverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments in, or which are\nexposed to, the affected region.\nHealthcare Sector Risk . The\nprofitability of companies in the\nhealthcare sector may be affected\nby government regulations and\ngovernment healthcare programs,\nincreases or decreases in the\ncost of medical products and\nservices, an increased emphasis\non outpatient services, demand\nfor medical products and services\nand product liability claims,\namong other factors. Many\nhealthcare companies are heavily\ndependent on patent protection,\nand the expiration of a company\u2019s\npatent may adversely affect that\ncompany\u2019s profitability.\nHealthcare companies are subject\nto competitive forces that may\nresult in price discounting, and\nmay be thinly capitalized and\nsusceptible to product\nobsolescence. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends\non the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a\nwhole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund is not actively managed,\nand BFA generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, S-7 including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund\nwill not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index,\nit is subject to the risk that\nthe investment strategy of BFA\nmay not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee\nthat the Fund\u2019s investment\nresults will have a high degree\nof correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Trading Risk .\nThe Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the\npotential lack of an active\nmarket for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses\nfrom trading in secondary\nmarkets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in\nthe process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing\nin U.S. issuers subjects the Fund\nto legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nSecurity Risk . Some countries\nand regions in which the Fund\ninvests have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism\nand strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a\ncountry's or region's security\nmay cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect\nits economy and the Fund's\ninvestments. Small Fund Risk.\nWhen the Fund\u2019s size is small,\nthe Fund may experience low\ntrading volume and wide bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund\nmay face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. S-8 Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences\nbetween the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index, pricing\ndifferences (including, as\napplicable, differences between a\nsecurity\u2019s price at the local\nmarket close and the Fund's\nvaluation of a security at the\ntime of calculation of the Fund's\nNAV), transaction costs incurred\nby the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of distributions, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-\nthrough tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to\nminimize the distribution of\ncapital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index\nor the costs to the Fund of\ncomplying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements,\namong other reasons. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT\nTHE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER\nTRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL\nFOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED\nFUNDS ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ). Valuation\nRisk . The price that the Fund\ncould receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurity or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may\ndiffer from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition,\nthe value of the securities or\nother assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or\nduring time periods when\ninvestors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on\ndays when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other\nassets may receive fewer or more\nshares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they\nwould have received had the\nsecurities or other assets not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. S-9\nPerformance Information The bar\nchart and table that follow show\nhow the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide\nsome indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing\nhow the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1 year and since\ninception compare with the\nUnderlying Index.Both assume that\nall dividends and distributions\nhave been reinvested in the Fund.\nPast performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily\nindicate how the Fund will\nperform in the future.

Fund\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient\ncapital gains of the same\ncharacter from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from\nthe sale of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes\non distributions and sales of\nFund shares may exceed Fund\nreturns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions.\n\nS-11\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. James Mauro\nand Karen Uyehara (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are\nprimarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the\nFund. Each Portfolio Manager\nsupervises a portfolio management\nteam. Mr. Mauro and Ms. Uyehara\nhave been Portfolio Managers of\nthe Fund since 2021. Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the\nFund may only be bought and sold\nin the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather\nthan at NAV, shares may trade at\na price greater than NAV (a\npremium) or less than NAV (a\ndiscount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the\ndifference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay\nto purchase shares of the Fund\n(bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when\nbuying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Tax Information The\nFund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an IRA, in which case, your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information. S-12 More\nInformation About the Fund This\nProspectus contains important\ninformation about investing in\nthe Fund. Please read this\nProspectus carefully before you\nmake any investment decisions.\nAdditional information regarding\nthe Fund is available at\nwww.iShares.com. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund.\nShares of the Fund are listed for\ntrading on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c\nNYSE Arca \u201d ). The market price\nfor a share of the Fund may be\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. ETFs are funds that\ntrade like other publicly traded\nsecurities. The Fund is designed\nto track an index. Similar to\nshares of an index mutual fund,\neach share of the Fund represents\nan ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\nintended to track a market index.\nUnlike shares of a mutual fund,\nwhich can be bought and redeemed\nfrom the issuing fund by all\nshareholders at a price based on\nNAV, shares of the Fund may be\npurchased or redeemed directly\nfrom the Fund at NAV solely by\nAuthorized Participants and only\nin aggregations of a specified\nnumber of shares ( \u201c Creation\nUnits \u201d ). Also unlike shares of\na mutual fund, shares of the Fund\nare listed on a national\nsecurities exchange and trade in\nthe secondary market at market\nprices that change throughout the\nday. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the\nsecurities markets and seeks to\ntrack the performance of a\nsecurities index that is not\nrepresentative of the market as a\nwhole. The Fund is designed to be\nused as part of broader asset\nallocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in the\nFund should not constitute a\ncomplete investment program. An\nindex is a financial calculation,\nbased on a grouping of financial\ninstruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while the\nFund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and the Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons,\nincluding transaction costs,\nnon-U.S. currency valuations,\nasset valuations, corporate\nactions (such as mergers and\nspin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex resulting from the Fund's\nuse of representative sampling or\nfrom legal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nthe Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the Index Provider may\nmake changes to the methodology\nor other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of\nthe Underlying Index performance\non a going-forward basis after\nthe effective date of such change\nor adjustment. Therefore, the\nUnderlying Index performance\nshown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\nor adjustment will generally not\nbe recalculated or restated to\nreflect such change or\nadjustment. Because the Fund uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, it can be\nexpected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. \u201c\nReplication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. 1 An investment in the\nFund is not a bank deposit and it\nis not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other\ngovernment agency, BFA or any of\nits affiliates. The Fund's\ninvestment objective and the\nUnderlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A\nFurther Discussion of Principal\nRisks The Fund is subject to\nvarious risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. You\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund could underperform other\ninvestments. The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and\nother assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio or its Underlying Index\nmay underperform in comparison to\nother indexes that track, or\nassets that represent, other\ncountries or geographic units,\nindustries, markets, market\nsegments, or asset classes.\nVarious types of securities,\nother assets and indexes may\nexperience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause the Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk. From time to time, an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, or another fund\nmay invest in the Fund and hold\nits investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund\nto achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Call\nRisk. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, an issuer of a\ncallable bond held by the Fund\nmay \u201c call \u201d or repay the\nsecurity before its stated\nmaturity, and the Fund may have\nto reinvest the proceeds in\nsecurities with lower yields,\nwhich would result in a 2 decline\nin the Fund\u2019s income, or in\nsecurities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable\nfeatures. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCredit Risk. Credit risk is the\nrisk that the issuer or guarantor\nof a debt instrument or the\ncounterparty to a derivatives\ncontract, repurchase agreement or\nloan of portfolio securities will\nbe unable or unwilling to make\nits timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or\notherwise honor its obligations.\nThere are varying degrees of\ncredit risk, depending on an\nissuer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial condition and on the\nterms of an obligation, which may\nbe reflected in the issuer\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating.\nThere is the chance that the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings will\nhave their credit ratings\ndowngraded or will default (\ni.e., fail to make scheduled\ninterest or principal payments),\nor that the market\u2019s perception\nof an issuer\u2019s creditworthiness\nmay worsen, potentially reducing\nthe Fund\u2019s income level or share\nprice. Cybersecurity Risk. The\nFund and entities that interact\nwith the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security\nand related cybersecurity risks,\nboth directly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich the Fund invests, which\ncould result in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with the\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof the Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to the 3\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. The\nFund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent\ncyber incidents. The Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. The\nFund and its shareholders could\nbe negatively impacted as a\nresult. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index\nuses criteria related to the ESG\ncharacteristics of issuers, this\nmay limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities\navailable to the Fund and, as a\nresult, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying\nindex does not use ESG criteria.\nThe Underlying Index\u2019s use of ESG\ncriteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating\ngreater weight to, securities or\nmarket sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or\nunderperform other funds that use\nESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling\nmay result in divergence of the\nFund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from\nthose of the Underlying Index.\nThe Index Provider to such\nUnderlying Index evaluates\nsecurities for inclusion and/or\nweighting in the Underlying Index\nbased on ESG criteria and data\nprovided by the Index Provider or\nthird parties. The Index\nProvider\u2019s evaluation of\nsecurities\u2019 ESG characteristics\ndepends on these criteria and\ndata, which may vary by index\nprovider, and no assurance can be\ngiven that they will be complete,\naccurate or current. In addition,\nthe Index Provider may evaluate\nsecurity-level ESG data\n(including ratings) and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or\nconstraints that are relevant to\nthe Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances.\nSecurities included in the\nUnderlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria\nbut may nevertheless remain in\nthe Underlying Index and in the\nFund using the Underlying Index\nuntil the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider.\nAs a result, certain securities\nin the Underlying Index, or the\nUnderlying Index as a whole, may\nnot meet the relevant ESG\nobjectives or constraints at all\ntimes. If the ESG assessment of a\nsecurity in the Underlying Index\nor the Fund changes, neither the\nFund nor BFA accepts any\nliability in relation to such\nchange. BFA does not monitor\nsecurities in the Underlying\nIndex with respect to ESG\nobjectives or constraints applied\nby the Index Provider and is not\nresponsible for changes to the\nESG assessment of a security in\nthe Underlying Index between\nrebalances. In addition, BFA does\nnot assess the validity of the\nIndex Provider\u2019s evaluation of\nthe ESG characteristics of\nsecurities or the criteria and\ndata used in such evaluation. The\nimpacts of risks related to ESG\ninvesting are likely to change\nover time, and new ESG risks may\nbe identified as further data and\ninformation regarding ESG factors\nand impacts become available. In\naddition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop,\nand the ESG methodology applied\nby the Index Provider may change\nover time. 4 Financials Sector\nRisk. Companies in the financials\nsector are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and\nintervention, which may adversely\naffect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and\nliquid assets they must maintain\nand, potentially, their size.\nGovernmental regulation may\nchange frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials\nsector, including effects not\nintended by such regulation.\nIncreased risk taking by\nfinancial companies may also\nresult in greater overall risk in\nthe U.S. and global financials\nsector. The impact of changes in\ncapital requirements, or recent\nor future regulation in various\ncountries, on any individual\nfinancial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole\ncannot be predicted. Certain\nrisks may impact the value of\ninvestments in the financials\nsector more severely than those\nof investments outside this\nsector, including the risks\nassociated with companies that\noperate with substantial\nfinancial leverage. Companies in\nthe financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of\ntheir borrowers and\ncounterparties, who may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree,\nincluding through swaps and other\nderivatives products. Financial\nservices companies may have\nsignificant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties,\nwith the result that a borrower\u2019s\nor counterparty\u2019s inability to\nmeet its obligations to one\ncompany may affect other\ncompanies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk\nmay result in significant\nnegative impacts to companies\nwith direct exposure to the\ndefaulting counterparty as well\nas adverse cascading effects in\nthe markets and the financials\nsector generally. Companies in\nthe financials sector may also be\nadversely affected by increases\nin interest rates and loan\nlosses, decreases in the\navailability of money or asset\nvaluations, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public\nperception and adverse conditions\nin other related markets.\nInsurance companies, in\nparticular, may be subject to\nsevere price competition and/or\nrate regulation, which may have\nan adverse impact on their\nprofitability. The financials\nsector is particularly sensitive\nto fluctuations in interest\nrates. The financials sector is\nalso a target for cyberattacks.\nCybersecurity incidents and\ntechnology malfunctions and\nfailures have become increasingly\nfrequent and have caused\nsignificant losses to companies\nin this sector, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund. The\nextent to which the Fund may\ninvest in a company that engages\nin securities-related activities\nor banking is limited by\napplicable law. Geographic Risk.\nSome of the companies in which\nthe Fund invests are located in\nparts of the world that have\nhistorically been prone to\nnatural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes or tsunamis, and are\neconomically sensitive to\nenvironmental events. Any such\nevent may adversely impact the\neconomies of these geographic\nareas or business operations of\ncompanies in these geographic\nareas, causing an adverse impact\non the value of the Fund.\nHealthcare Sector Risk. The\nprofitability of companies in the\nhealthcare sector may be\nadversely affected by the\nfollowing factors, among others:\nextensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing\npressure, an increased emphasis\non outpatient services, changes\nin the demand for medical\nproducts and services, a limited\nnumber of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in\ntechnologies and other 5 market\ndevelopments. Many healthcare\ncompanies are heavily dependent\non patent protection. The\nexpiration of a company\u2019s patents\nmay adversely affect that\ncompany\u2019s profitability. Many\nhealthcare companies are subject\nto extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar\nclaims. Healthcare companies are\nsubject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to\nraise prices and, in fact, may\nresult in price discounting. The\nU.S. Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 allows for the negotiation\nof prescription drug prices on\nbehalf of Medicare recipients,\nwhich may result in reduced\nprescription prices. This could\nreduce some healthcare companies\u2019\noverall profitability. Many new\nproducts in the healthcare sector\nmay be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of\nobtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful.\nCompanies in the healthcare\nsector may be thinly capitalized\nand may be susceptible to product\nobsolescence. In addition, a\nnumber of legislative proposals\nconcerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress\nin recent years. It is unclear\nwhat proposals will ultimately be\nenacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the\nhealthcare sector. Income Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s income may decline if\ninterest rates fall. This decline\nin income can occur because the\nFund may subsequently invest in\nlower-yielding bonds as bonds in\nits portfolio mature, are near\nmaturity or are called, bonds in\nthe Underlying Index are\nsubstituted, or the Fund\notherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds. The Index\nProvider\u2019s substitution of bonds\nin the Underlying Index may\noccur, for example, when the time\nto maturity for the bond no\nlonger matches the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s stated maturity\nguidelines. Index-Related Risk.\nThe Fund seeks to achieve a\nreturn that corresponds generally\nto the price and yield\nperformance, before fees and\nexpenses, of its Underlying Index\nas published by the Index\nProvider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or its\nagents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to the Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and 6 will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from the Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact the\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to the\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise\nbe removed at the rebalance (due\nto, for example, changes in\nmarket capitalization or issuer\ncredit ratings) may remain,\ncausing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying\nIndex to vary from those expected\nunder normal conditions. In\naddition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between\nperiodic index reviews and\nreconstitutions, the Underlying\nIndex may include constituents\nthat do not align with its\nobjective or selection criteria,\nand the Fund tracking the\nUnderlying Index may be similarly\naffected. In addition to\nscheduled rebalances, the Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The Fund\nwill in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase\nthe correlation between the\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear\nany transaction costs and market\nexposure from such portfolio\nrebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc\nrebalances may increase the\nFund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nInterest Rate Risk. Changes in\ninterest rates may have\nunpredictable effects on fixed-\nincome markets and result in\nheightened market volatility and\nlower liquidity for certain\ninstruments, all of which may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Interest rate\nchanges can be sudden and\nunpredictable and are influenced\nby a number of factors, including\ngovernment policy, monetary\npolicy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. When interest rates\nrise, the value of fixed-income\nsecurities or other instruments\nsensitive to interest rates\ntypically decreases. A measure\nthat investors commonly use to\ndetermine this price sensitivity\nis called duration. Fixed-income\nsecurities with longer durations\ntend to be more sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, usually\nmaking their prices more volatile\nthan those of securities with\nshorter durations. For example,\nif a bond has a duration of five\nyears and interest rates rise,\nthe price of the bond will likely\ndecline by a greater percentage\nthan for a bond with a one-year\nduration. To the extent a Fund\ninvests a substantial portion of\nits assets in fixed-income\nsecurities with longer duration,\nrising interest rates may cause\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments to decline\nsignificantly, which would\nadversely affect the value of the\nFund. Changes in prevailing\ninterest rates, particularly\nsudden and significant changes,\nmay lead to fluctuations in the\nvalue of floating rate debt\nsecurities, as the rates for\nthose securities typically reset\nonly periodically. In addition,\ndecreases in market-making\ncapacity for fixed-income dealers\nmay lead to lower trading volume,\nheightened volatility, wider bid-\nask spreads and less transparent\npricing in certain fixed-income\nmarkets. 7 During periods of very\nlow or negative interest rates, a\nFund may be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto shareholders. Under certain\nmarket conditions when interest\nrates are set at low levels and\nthe market prices of portfolio\nsecurities have increased, a Fund\nmay have a very low or even\nnegative yield, which would cause\nthe Fund to lose money in certain\nconditions and time periods.\nIssuer Risk. The performance of a\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk.\nThe Fund is not actively managed\nand invests in securities or\nother assets included in, or\nrepresentative of, its Underlying\nIndex, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. The Fund may\nbe affected by a general decline\nin market segments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. The Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non the Fund and its investments\nand could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. The Fund\nfaces numerous market trading\nrisks, any of which may lead to\nits shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to the NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund\nshares are listed for trading on\none or more stock exchanges,\nthere can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for\nFund shares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or\nAuthorized Participants. 8\nSecondary Listing Risks. The\nFund\u2019s shares may be listed or\ntraded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock\nexchanges other than the U.S.\nstock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained.\nFund shares also may be available\nto non-U.S. investors through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. There can be no\nassurance that the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill continue to trade on any\nsuch stock exchange or in any\nmarket or that the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. The Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in\nothers, and investors are subject\nto the execution and settlement\nrisks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\nthat is available to investors\nwho trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be\navailable to investors who trade\nin other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of the Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by the Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\nthe Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\nSecondary market trading in Fund\nshares may be halted by a stock\nexchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt the\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in\nthe Fund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, the Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of the Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on the\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of the Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market 9 value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of the Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s\nshares may deviate significantly\nfrom NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to the Fund\u2019s NAV are\nnot likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that the Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of the Fund\nthat differ significantly from\nits NAV. Authorized Participants\nmay be less willing to create or\nredeem the Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares\n(the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price\nat which they are willing to sell\nFund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price).\nThe spread varies over time for\nFund shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity. It\nis generally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if the\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Increased\nmarket volatility also may cause\nwider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults, and an investment in\nFund shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Operational Risk. The\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. Investing\nin U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other\nrisks, may have an 10 adverse\neffect on the U.S. economy and\nthe securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also\nsubject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods.\nU.S. security risks include acts\nof terrorism, internal unrest and\na deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nBlackRock Institutional Trust\nCompany, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ), which\nis the securities lending agent\nfor the iShares/BlackRock ETFs,\nwill take into account the tax\nimpact to Fund shareholders of\nsubstitute payments for dividends\nwhen managing the securities\nlending program. Security Risk.\nSome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund invests have experienced\nacts of terrorism and strained\ninternational relations due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty\nin the markets of these\ngeographic areas and may\nadversely affect their economies.\nSmall Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. If the\nFund were required to delist from\nthe listing exchange, the Fund\u2019s\nvalue may rapidly decline and its\nperformance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. Tracking Error\nRisk. The Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences\nbetween the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index, pricing\ndifferences (including, as\napplicable, differences between a\nsecurity\u2019s price at the local\nmarket close and the Fund's\nvaluation of a security at the\ntime of calculation of the Fund's\nNAV), transaction costs incurred\nby the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of distributions, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-\nthrough tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to\nminimize the distribution of\ncapital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index\nor the costs to the Fund of\ncomplying with 11 various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements,\namong other reasons. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. BFA EXPECTS THAT\nTHE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER\nTRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL\nFOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs. Valuation\nRisk. The price that the Fund\ncould receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurity or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may\ndiffer from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable).\nBecause non-U.S. exchanges or\nmarkets may be open on days or\nduring time periods when the Fund\ndoes not price its shares, the\nvalue of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nmay change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not\nable to purchase or sell Fund\nshares. In addition, for purposes\nof calculating the Fund's NAV,\nthe value of assets denominated\nin non-U.S. currencies (if any)\nis translated into U.S. dollars\nat the prevailing market rates.\nThis translation may result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund's NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized\nParticipants that create or\nredeem Fund shares on days when\nthe Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or\nlower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued\nor been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value\ninvestments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by\npricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. A\nFurther Discussion of Other Risks\nThe Fund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated\nwith its investments and\ninvestment strategies. The order\nof the below risk factors does\nnot indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor.\nClose-Out Risk for Qualified\nFinancial Contracts. Regulations\nadopted by global prudential\nregulators require counterparties\nthat are part of U.S. or foreign\nglobal systemically important\nbanking organizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Consumer\nServices Industry Risk. The\nsuccess of firms in the consumer\nservices industry and certain\nretailers (including food and\nbeverage, general retailers,\nmedia, 12 and travel and leisure\ncompanies) is tied closely to the\nperformance of the domestic and\ninternational economies, interest\nrates, exchange rates and\nconsumer confidence. The consumer\nservices industry depends heavily\non disposable household income\nand consumer spending. Companies\nin the consumer services industry\nmay be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may also have\nan adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the\nconsumer services industry are\nfacing increased government and\nregulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or\nregulatory action. Changes in\nconsumer demographics and\npreferences in the countries in\nwhich the issuers of securities\nheld by the Fund are located and\nin the countries to which they\nexport their products may affect\nthe success of consumer products.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund\u2019s\nNAV is determined on the basis of\nthe U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the\nU.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof foreign currency, even if the\nforeign currency value of the\nFund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange\nrates can be very volatile and\ncan change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. In addition, the\nFund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions\nbetween U.S. dollars and foreign\ncurrencies. European Economic\nRisk. The Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201c EU \u201d )\nrequires compliance by member\nstates that are members of the\neurozone with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels,\nas well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every\ncountry in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone.\nAdditionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are\nindependent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the\nUnited Kingdom's (the \u201c U.K. \u201d )\neconomy may be affected by global\neconomic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common\ncurrency of eurozone countries),\nthe default or threat of default\nby an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state\nmay have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other\nEU member states and their\ntrading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have\nhistorically experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt\nlevels in several European\ncountries, including, but not\nlimited to, Austria, Belgium,\nCyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Portugal, Spain and\nUkraine. These events have\naffected and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may\nsignificantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial\nproblems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the\ndesired results, may result in\nsocial unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or\nmay have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations\naround the world. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The U.K. left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020.\nBrexit could adversely affect\nEuropean or worldwide 13\npolitical, regulatory, economic\nor market conditions and could\ncontribute to instability in\nglobal political institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial\nmarkets. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to\ninfluence by disruptive political\ngroups and ideologies, including,\nfor example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of\nEuropean countries may be subject\nto change and such countries may\nexperience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nThe occurrence of terrorist\nincidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also\nimpact financial markets. The\nimpact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant\nand far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value and\nliquidity of the Fund's\ninvestments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine\non February 24, 2022. The extent\nand duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the\nvalue of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would\nhave invested more than 15% of\nits net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\nthe Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less\nwithout significantly changing\nthe market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid 14\ninvestments may be harder to\nvalue, especially in changing\nmarkets. Although the Fund\nprimarily seeks to redeem shares\nof the Fund on an in-kind basis,\nif the Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced\nprices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption\nrequests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This\nmay be magnified in a rising\ninterest rate environment or\nother circumstances where\nredemptions from the Fund may be\ngreater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to\nliquidate holdings at the same\ntime as the Fund, causing\nincreased supply of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments in the\nmarket and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Large Shareholder and Large-\nScale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund,\nincluding an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\na market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own\nor manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their\ninvestment in the Fund for a\nlimited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or\nloan Fund shares (to secure\nfinancing or otherwise), which\nmay result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party.\nThere can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent the Fund permits\nredemptions in cash, these\nredemptions may force the Fund to\nsell portfolio securities or\nother assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV,\nhave a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares,\nincrease the Fund\u2019s brokerage\ncosts, accelerate the realization\nof taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make\ntaxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the\nFund otherwise would have. In\naddition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as\nreceiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during\nor with respect to such tax year.\nThe Fund also may be required to\nsell its more liquid investments\nto meet a large redemption, in\nwhich case the Fund\u2019s remaining\nassets may be less liquid, more\nvolatile, and more difficult to\nprice. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nNational Closed Market Trading\nRisk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held\nby the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets\nthat may be closed 15 when the\nsecurities exchange on which the\nFund\u2019s shares trade is open,\nthere are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current\nprice and its last quoted price (\ni.e ., the quote from the closed\nforeign market to the Fund). The\nimpact of a closed foreign market\non the Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-U.S. Issuers Risk .\nThe Fund may invest in U.S.\ndollar-denominated bonds of\nnon-U.S. corporate issuers.\nSecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers have different risks from\nsecurities issued by U.S.\nissuers. These risks include\ndifferences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting\nstandards, the possibility of\nexpropriation or confiscatory\ntaxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control\nregulations, political\ninstability which could affect\nU.S. investments in non-U.S.\ncountries, uncertainties of\ntransnational litigation, and\npotential restrictions on the\nflow of international capital,\nincluding the possible seizure or\nnationalization of the securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers held\nby the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may\nbe subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers.\nMoreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy\nin such respects as growth of\ngross domestic product, rate of\ninflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and\nbalance of payment positions.\nUnfavorable political, economic\nor governmental developments in\nnon-U.S. countries could affect\nthe payment of a security\u2019s\nprincipal and interest.\nSecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may also be less liquid\nthan, and more difficult to value\nthan, securities of U.S. issuers.\nIn addition, the value of these\nsecurities may fluctuate due to\nchanges in the exchange rate of\nthe issuer\u2019s local currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar. Reliance\non Trading Partners Risk. The\neconomies of many countries or\nregions in which the Fund invests\nare highly dependent on trade\nwith certain key trading\npartners. Reduction in spending\non products and services by these\nkey trading partners, institution\nof tariffs or other trade\nbarriers or a slowdown in the\neconomies of key trading partners\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of any company in\nwhich the Fund invests and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nFund\u2019s performance. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries.\nInvestment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed\ncountries generally tend to rely\non services sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth.\nA prolonged slowdown in one or\nmore services sectors is likely\nto have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed\ncountries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund invests have experienced\nstrained international relations\ndue to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security\nconcerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to\nwhich the Fund has exposure.\nHeavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and\nproduct markets, may have an\nadverse effect on 16 certain\nissuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth\nor cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed\ncountries are heavily indebted\nand face rising healthcare and\nretirement expenses. In addition,\nprice fluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations\nimpacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies.\nTechnology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources and\npersonnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product\nintroduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nmay be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and\ndistribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners.\nThey are heavily dependent on\npatent and other intellectual\nproperty rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their\nprofitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or\nlegal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, actual or\nperceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects\nin their products and services,\nwhich may result in lawsuits,\ngovernment enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs.\nTelecommunications Sector Risk.\nThe telecommunications sector is\nsubject to extensive government\nregulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental\nregulations, delays or failure to\nreceive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of\nnew regulatory requirements may\nnegatively affect the business of\ntelecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the\nworld, specifically in the area\nof pre-marketing clearance of\nproducts and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ndomestic telecommunications\nmarket is characterized by\nincreasing competition and\nregulation by various state and\nfederal regulatory authorities.\nCompanies in the\ntelecommunications sector may\nencounter distressed cash flows\ndue to the need to commit\nsubstantial capital to meet\nincreasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new\ntechnology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products\nand services of certain\ntelecommunications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders are generally required\nto obtain franchises or licenses\nin order to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk.\nIf certain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor the Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including the Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. The\ncapacity of the Fund to invest in\ncertain securities or other\nassets may be affected by the\nrelevant threshold limits, and\nsuch limitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the 17 Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. To the extent\na Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of\nthe Fund being underinvested in\nan asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the\nrisk of tracking error. For\nexample, ownership limits may\napply to securities whose issuers\noperate in certain regulated\nindustries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such\nlimits also may apply where the\ninvesting entity (such as the\nFund) is subject to corporate or\nregulatory ownership restrictions\nor invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including the Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits\nwithout the grant of a license or\nother regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases,\nexceeding such thresholds may\ncause BFA and its affiliates, the\nFund or other client accounts to\nsuffer disadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the\nTrust's policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nis available in the Fund's\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fund\nfact sheets providing information\nregarding the Fund's top holdings\nare posted on www.iShares.com\nwhen available and may be\nrequested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement Investment Adviser. As\ninvestment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the\ngeneral management and\nadministration of the Fund. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nIn managing the Fund, BFA may\ndraw upon the research and\nexpertise of its asset management\naffiliates with respect to\ncertain portfolio securities. In\nseeking to achieve the Fund's\ninvestment objective, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers,\ninvestment strategists and other\ninvestment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many\ndisciplines and leverages BFA\u2019s\nextensive resources. Pursuant to\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFund), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. For the fiscal year ended\nFebruary 29, 2024, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund's\naverage daily net assets, at the\nannual rate of 0.18%. 18 BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses in order to limit total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of\nMarch 31, 2024, BFA and its\naffiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.5 trillion. BFA\nand its affiliates trade and\ninvest for their own accounts in\nthe actual securities and types\nof securities in which the Fund\nmay also invest, which may affect\nthe price of such securities. A\ndiscussion regarding the basis\nfor the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available\nin the Fund's Semi-Annual Report\nfor the period ended August 31.\nPortfolio Managers. James Mauro\nand Karen Uyehara are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management\nteams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. James Mauro has\nbeen employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a portfolio manager\nsince 2011. Prior to that, Mr.\nMauro was a Vice President at\nState Street Global Advisors. Mr.\nMauro has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2021.\nKaren Uyehara has been employed\nby BFA or its affiliates as a\nsenior portfolio manager since\n2010. Prior to that, Ms. Uyehara\nwas a portfolio manager at\nWestern Asset Management Company\n(WAMCO). Ms. Uyehara has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund\nsince 2021. The Fund's SAI\nprovides additional information\nabout the Portfolio Managers'\ncompensation, other accounts\nmanaged by the Portfolio Managers\nand the Portfolio Managers'\nownership (if any) of shares in\nthe Fund. Administrator,\nCustodian and Transfer Agent.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the\nadministrator, custodian and\ntransfer agent for the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and\nits affiliates (including\nBlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees,\nin the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts\nand other accounts they manage,\nmay present conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. BFA and its\nAffiliates provide investment\nmanagement services to other\nfunds and discretionary managed\naccounts that may follow\ninvestment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and may\nengage in the ordinary course of\nbusiness in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof their clients may conflict\nwith those of the Fund. BFA or\none or more Affiliates act, or\nmay act, as an investor, research\nprovider, investment manager,\ncommodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor,\nfinancier, underwriter, 19\nadviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal,\nand have other direct and\nindirect interests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other instruments\nin which the Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. The Fund may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies with which an\nAffiliate has significant debt or\nequity investments or other\ninterests. The Fund may also\ninvest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides and\nis compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to\nthe proceeds from the sale of\nsuch issuances. The Fund also may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies for which an\nAffiliate provides or may in the\nfuture provide research coverage.\nAn Affiliate may have business\nrelationships with, and purchase\nor distribute or sell services or\nproducts from or to,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend the Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for the Fund, and may receive\ncompensation for such services.\nBFA or one or more Affiliates may\nengage in proprietary trading and\nadvise accounts and funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of the Fund\nand/or that engage in and compete\nfor transactions in the same\ntypes of securities, currencies\nand other instruments as the\nFund. This may include\ntransactions in securities issued\nby other open-end and closed-end\ninvestment companies (which may\ninclude investment companies that\nare affiliated with the Fund and\nBFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940\nAct \u201d )). The trading activities\nof BFA and these Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to\npositions held directly or\nindirectly by the Fund and may\nresult in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in certain\nsecurities that are senior or\njunior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the\nsecurities that are owned by the\nFund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation\nto share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy\nwith the Fund. As a result, an\nAffiliate may compete with the\nFund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of the\nFund's investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those\nof an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by BlackRock or\nan Affiliate, and it is possible\nthat the Fund could sustain\nlosses during periods in which\none or more Affiliates and other\naccounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, the\nFund may, from time to time,\nenter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or its or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by\nclients advised or managed by BFA\nor its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by\none or more clients or by BFA or\nits Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment\nstrategies of the Fund. The\nFund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or\ntheir internal policies designed\nto comply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Fund has retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as the\nsecurities lending agent for the\nFund to the extent that the Fund\nparticipates in the securities\nlending program. For these\nservices, the 20 securities\nlending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s\nlending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received\nas collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the\nentities to which the Fund may\nlend its portfolio securities\nunder the securities lending\nprogram. Under an ETF Services\nAgreement, the Fund has retained\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each\ncreation or redemption order from\nthe Authorized Participant for\nthe ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the\ndesign and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may\nhave, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships\nwith BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. It is\nalso possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other\nfunds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of the\nFund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of the Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock and/or\nits advisory clients. The\nactivities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts\nof interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. See the\nSAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares\nof the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund\nonly in Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof, as discussed\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only\nan Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the\nFund generally trade in the\nsecondary market in amounts less\nthan a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading\nduring the trading day. Shares\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies.\nThe Trust does not impose any\nminimum investment for shares of\nthe Fund purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. The Fund's shares trade\nunder the ticker symbol \u201c ELQD. \u201d\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange or other secondary\nmarket involves two types of\ncosts that may apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. The commission is\nfrequently a fixed amount and may\nbe a significant 21 proportional\ncost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell small amounts of shares.\nIn addition, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d that is,\nany difference between the bid\nprice and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for\nshares of the Fund based on the\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower\nif the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and\nhigher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity (which is often the\ncase for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The\nFund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity of the underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund\ndoes not impose restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies\nand procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares because the Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-\nrelated transactions no later\nthan the close of the primary\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Fund has\ntaken certain measures ( e.g .,\nimposing transaction fees on\npurchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units and reserving the\nright to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to\nthe Fund, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in Fund\nshares occurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve\nthe Fund directly, and such\ntrading is unlikely to cause many\nof the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The\nnational securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares are\nlisted is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following\nholidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. The Fund\u2019s primary listing\nexchange is NYSE Arca. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nHowever, registered investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin the Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in SEC\nrules. In order for a registered\ninvestment company to invest in\nshares of the Fund beyond the\nlimitations of Section 12(d)(1)\nin reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, the registered 22\ninvestment company must, among\nother things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. Foreign\ninvestment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund\nonly up to the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action\nrelief. Book Entry. Shares of the\nFund are held in book-entry form,\nwhich means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The\nDepository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC\n\u201d ) or its nominee is the record\nowner of, and holds legal title\nto, all outstanding shares of the\nFund. Investors owning shares of\nthe Fund are beneficial owners as\nshown on the records of DTC or\nits participants. DTC serves as\nthe securities depository for\nshares of the Fund. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of shares,\nyou are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares\nregistered in your name, and you\nare not considered a registered\nowner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of\nshares, you must rely upon the\nprocedures of DTC and its\nparticipants. These procedures\nare the same as those that apply\nto any other securities that you\nhold in book-entry or \u201c street\nname \u201d form. Share Prices. The\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s\nshares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s\ndaily NAV and are affected by\nmarket forces such as the supply\nof and demand for ETF shares and\nunderlying securities held by the\nFund, economic conditions and\nother factors. Determination of\nNet Asset Value. The NAV of the\nFund normally is determined once\ndaily Monday through Friday,\ngenerally as of the close of\nregular trading hours of the New\nYork Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d )\n(normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime) on each day that the NYSE\nis open for trading, based on\nprices at the time of closing,\nprovided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of the\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the net assets of\nthe Fund ( i.e. , the value of\nits total assets less total\nliabilities) by the total number\nof outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the\nnearest cent. The value of the\nsecurities and other assets and\nliabilities held by the Fund is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\n1940 Act. The Fund values fixed-\nincome portfolio securities using\nlast available bid prices or\ncurrent market quotations\nprovided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices)\nsupplied by the Fund's approved\nindependent third-party pricing\nservices, each in accordance with\nBFA's valuation policies and\nprocedures. Pricing services may\nuse matrix pricing or valuation\nmodels that utilize certain\ninputs and assumptions to derive\nvalues. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but the Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt 23\nobligations with sixty days or\nless remaining to maturity unless\nBFA determines in good faith that\nsuch method does not represent\nfair value. Generally, trading in\nnon-U.S. securities and money\nmarket instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of regular trading hours of\nthe NYSE. The values of such\nsecurities used in computing the\nNAV of the Fund are determined as\nof such times. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue the Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. BFA may conclude that\na market quotation is not readily\navailable or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons, if a market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability is thinly traded, when\nthere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation, or if the\ntrading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities\nof, the Fund. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nheld by the Fund is the amount\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing\nthe Fund\u2019s investments using fair\nvalue pricing will result in\nprices that may differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nin which the particular fair\nvalues were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in\na difference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Dividends and\nDistributions. General Policies.\nDividends from net investment\nincome, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a\nyear by the Fund. Distributions\nof net realized securities gains,\nif any, generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for the Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on shares of\nthe Fund are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof such shares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC participants\nand indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend\nReinvestment 24 Service for use\nby beneficial owners of the Fund\nfor reinvestment of their\ndividend distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact\ntheir broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation therein. Brokers\nmay require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If this service is\navailable and used, dividend\ndistributions of both income and\nrealized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in\nadditional whole shares of the\nFund purchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of\nshares. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about\nthe potential tax consequences of\nan investment in shares of the\nFund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\nthe Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. There is no\nguarantee that shares of the Fund\nwill receive certain regulatory\nor accounting treatment. You\nshould consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax\nconsequences of an investment in\nshares of the Fund. Unless your\ninvestment in Fund shares is made\nthrough a tax-exempt entity or\ntax-deferred retirement account,\nsuch as an IRA, in which case\nyour distributions generally will\nbe taxable when withdrawn, you\nneed to be aware of the possible\ntax consequences when the Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell\nFund shares. Taxes on\nDistributions. Distributions from\nthe Fund\u2019s net investment income,\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of the Fund's\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. The Fund's\ndistributions of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess\nof net short-term capital losses\nare taxable as long-term capital\ngains, regardless of how long you\nhave held the shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15%\nor 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts.\nDistributions from the Fund are\nsubject to a 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax on \u201c\nnet investment income, \u201d for\nindividuals with incomes\nexceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and\nof estates and trusts. In\ngeneral, your distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. You may lose the\nability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund if your Fund shares are\nloaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If\nthe Fund's distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of\nthe distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of\ncapital to shareholders.\nDistributions in excess of the\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess\nof the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not\nbe taxable but will reduce the\nshareholder's 25 cost basis and\nwill result in a higher capital\ngain or lower capital loss when\nthose shares on which the\ndistribution was received are\nsold. Once a shareholder's cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gain, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains earned\nby the Fund with respect to\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If more than 50% of the\ntotal assets of the Fund at the\nclose of a year consists of\nnon-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter\nwhere traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund\nmay \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. This means that\nyou would be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. For purposes of\nforeign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of the Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nIf you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. entity (other than\na pass-through entity to the\nextent owned by U.S. persons),\nthe Fund\u2019s ordinary income\ndividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. federal\nwithholding tax, unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies provided that\nwithholding tax will generally\nnot apply to any gain or income\nrealized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder in respect of any\ndistributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of shares of\nthe Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items\npaid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they\nagree to collect and disclose to\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain\nother foreign entities, unless\nthey certify certain information\nregarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial\ninstitutions will need to (i)\nenter into agreements with the\nIRS that state that they will\nprovide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification\nnumbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of\nU.S. accounts; report to the IRS\ncertain information with respect\nto U.S. accounts maintained,\nagree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant\nforeign financial institutions or\nto account holders who fail to\nprovide the required information;\nand determine certain other\ninformation concerning their\naccount holders, or (ii) in the\nevent that an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign\nentities may need to report the\nname, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial\nU.S. ownership, unless certain\nexceptions apply. 26 If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the\nU.S., by law, backup withholding\nat a 24% rate will apply to your\ndistributions and proceeds if you\nhave not provided a taxpayer\nidentification number or social\nsecurity number and made other\nrequired certifications. Taxes\nWhen Shares Are Sold. Currently,\nany capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ngain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year.\nAny capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital\nloss on the sale of shares held\nfor six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect\nto such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of\nFund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net\ninvestment income \u201d for purposes\nof the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions. Prior\nto trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Fund are \u201c\ncreated \u201d at NAV by market\nmakers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size\nCreation Units or multiples\nthereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) has\nentered into an agreement with\nthe Fund's Distributor, an\naffiliate of BFA. An Authorized\nParticipant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the\nFund or one of its service\nproviders that allows such member\nor participant to place orders\nfor the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. A creation\ntransaction, which is subject to\nacceptance by the Distributor and\nthe Fund, generally takes place\nwhen an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into the Fund a\ndesignated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions (a \u201c creation basket \u201d\n), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing\nthe value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which\ntogether approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation\nUnits. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the\nFund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be\nsubstituted). The Fund may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units partially or\nsolely for cash. Except when\naggregated in Creation Units,\nshares are not redeemable by the\nFund. Creation and redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund\nwill accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d\nMore information regarding custom\nbaskets is contained in the\nFund's SAI. The prices at which\ncreations and redemptions occur\nare based on the next calculation\nof NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is received in\nan acceptable form under the\nauthorized participant agreement.\nOnly an Authorized Participant\nmay create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers,\nincluding, without limitation,\naffiliates of the Fund. In the\nevent of a system failure or\nother interruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants, orders\nto purchase or redeem Creation\nUnits either may not be executed\naccording to the Fund's\ninstructions or may not be\nexecuted at all, or the Fund may\nnot be able to place or change\norders. 27 To the extent the Fund\nengages in in-kind transactions,\nthe Fund intends to comply with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws\nin accepting securities for\ndeposit and satisfying\nredemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means,\nassuring that any securities\naccepted for deposit and any\nsecurities used to satisfy\nredemption requests will be sold\nin transactions that would be\nexempt from registration under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d\nas such term is defined in Rule\n144A under the 1933 Act, will not\nbe able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Creations and\nredemptions must be made through\na firm that is either a member of\nthe Continuous Net Settlement\nSystem of the National Securities\nClearing Corporation or a DTC\nparticipant that has executed an\nagreement with the Distributor\nwith respect to creations and\nredemptions of Creation Unit\naggregations. Information about\nthe procedures regarding creation\nand redemption of Creation Units\n(including the cut-off times for\nreceipt of creation and\nredemption orders) is included in\nthe Fund's SAI. Because new\nshares may be created and issued\non an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of the Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that\nsome activities on their part\nmay, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is\nan underwriter must take into\naccount all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers who\nare not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution\n(as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part\nof an \u201c unsold allotment \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be unable\nto take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange members,\nthe prospectus delivery mechanism\nof Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding. Householding is an\noption available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a\nmethod of delivery, based on the\npreference of the individual\ninvestor, in which a single copy\nof certain shareholder documents\ncan be delivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if you\nare interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change\nyour householding status.\nDistribution The Distributor or\nits agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Fund. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are\n28 purchased or sold by the Fund.\nThe Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. BFA or its\naffiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems,\ndata provision services, or their\nmaking shares of the Fund and\ncertain other iShares funds\navailable to their customers\ngenerally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such\npayments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary,\nare not made by the Fund. Rather,\nsuch payments are made by BFA or\nits affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or\nindirectly in part from fees paid\nby the iShares funds complex.\nPayments of this type are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-\nsharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it\nrecommends or makes available, or\nthe level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the\npayments or other financial\nincentives it is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives\noffered or made to an\nintermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary\nand its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the\nFund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More\ninformation regarding these\npayments is contained in the\nFund's SAI. Please contact your\nsalesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information\nregarding any such payments his\nor her firm may receive from BFA\nor its affiliates. 29\n\nFinancial Highlights The\nfinancial highlights table is\nintended to help investors\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial\nperformance since inception.\nCertain information reflects\nfinancial results for a single\nshare of the Fund. The total\nreturns in the table represent\nthe rate that an investor would\nhave earned (or lost) on an\ninvestment in the Fund, assuming\nreinvestment of all dividends and\ndistributions.

Each Fund offers and issues shares at their\nnet asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Funds are\nlisted for trading on national securities\nexchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c\nCboe BZX \u201d ), The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ( \u201c\nNasdaq \u201d ) or NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c NYSE Arca \u201d\n) (each a \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ). Shares of\neach Fund are traded in the secondary market\nand elsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally ranging\nfrom 10,000 to 100,000 shares or multiples\nthereof. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin each Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of each Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe applicable Prospectus. Shares of each Fund\nare listed for trading, and trade throughout\nthe day, on the applicable Listing Exchange\nand in other secondary markets. Shares of\ncertain Funds may also be listed on certain\nnon-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance\nthat the requirements of the Listing Exchange\nnecessary to maintain the listing of shares of\nany Fund will continue to be met. The Listing\nExchange may, but is not required to, remove\nthe shares of a Fund from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iv) any event\nshall occur or condition shall exist that, in\nthe opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of a Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of such Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of a Fund through\na broker, you may incur a brokerage commission\ndetermined by that broker, as well as other\ncharges.\n\n2\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Funds in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Funds or an investor's\nequity interest in the Funds. Investment\nStrategies and Risks Each Fund seeks to\nachieve its objective by investing primarily\nin both fixed-income securities that compose\nits relevant Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. The Underlying Indexes for the iShares\nHigh Yield Systematic Bond ETF and iShares\nInvestment Grade Systematic Bond ETF are based\non a proprietary methodology created and\nsponsored by BlackRock Index Services, LLC\n(the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ). The Index Provider\nis an affiliated person of the iShares High\nYield Systematic Bond ETF and iShares\nInvestment Grade Systematic Bond ETF of BFA.\nEach Fund operates as an index fund and is not\nactively managed. Adverse performance of a\nsecurity in a Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily\nnot result in the elimination of the security\nfrom the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Each Fund engages\nin representative sampling, which is investing\nin a sample of securities selected by BFA to\nhave a collective investment profile similar\nto that of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market value and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as yield, credit rating,\nmaturity and duration) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. A fund that uses representative\nsampling generally does not hold all of the\nsecurities that are in its underlying index.\nAlthough the Funds do not seek leveraged\nreturns, certain instruments used by the Funds\nmay have a leveraging effect as described\nbelow. Each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury\nBond ETF, iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF,\niShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares\n7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 10-20\nYear Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 20+ Year\nTreasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury\nSTRIPS Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury\nBond ETF (the \u201c Treasury Bond Funds \u201d ) will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in U.S. Treasury securities that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Each Treasury Bond Fund will\ninvest no more than 10% of its assets in\nfutures, options and swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. Each Treasury Bond Fund\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and expenses of\nthe Fund. Each of the iShares 1-5 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF, iShares BBB Rated Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares Broad USD Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit\nBond ETF, iShares High Yield Systematic Bond\nETF, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate\nGovernment/Credit Bond ETF and iShares\nInvestment Grade Systematic Bond ETF will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in fixed income securities of the types\nincluded in the Underlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund will invest no\nmore than 10% of its assets in futures,\noptions and swaps contracts that BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index\nas well as in fixed income securities other\nthan the types included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. Each of\nthe iShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10\nYear USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD\nBond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF\nand iShares MBS ETF will invest at least 80%\nof its assets in the component securities of\nthe Underlying Index and to-be-announced ( \u201c\nTBA \u201d ) transactions that have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of\nthe component securities of the Underlying\nIndex, and the Fund will invest at least 90%\nof its assets in fixed income securities of\nthe types included in the Underlying Index\nthat BFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund will invest no\nmore than 10% of its assets in futures,\noptions and swaps contracts that BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index\nas well as in fixed income securities other\nthan the types included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\n\n3\n\nequivalent investments associated with a TBA\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. For\nexample, the iShares Agency Bond ETF may\ninvest in securities not included in the\nUnderlying Index in order to reflect various\ncorporate actions (such as mergers) and other\nchanges in the Underlying Index (such as\nreconstitutions, additions and deletions).\nEach of the iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and\niShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in fixed income securities of the types\nincluded in the Underlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund will invest no more\nthan 10% of its assets in futures, options,\nand swaps contracts that BFA believes will\nhelp the Fund track the Underlying Index as\nwell as in fixed income securities other than\nthe types included in the Underlying Index,\nbut which BFA believes will help the Fund\ntrack the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. Each of\nthe iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market\nETF and iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond\nETF will invest at least 80% of its assets in\nthe component securities of the Underlying\nIndex and in investments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index (i.e. , TBAs), and the Fund\nwill invest at least 90% of its assets in\nfixed income securities of the types included\nin the Underlying Index that BFA believes will\nhelp the Fund track the Underlying Index. The\nFund will invest no more than 10% of its\nassets in futures, options, and swaps\ncontracts that BFA believes will help the Fund\ntrack the Underlying Index as well as in fixed\nincome securities other than the types\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. Each of\nthe iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares\nNational Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni\nBond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni\nBond ETF (the \u201c Municipal Bond Funds \u201d ) will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in fixed income securities of the types\nincluded in the Underlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Each Municipal Bond Fund\nwill invest no more than 10% of its assets in\nfutures, options and swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index as well as in fixed income\nsecurities other than the types included in\nthe Underlying Index, but which BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index.\nCash and cash equivalent investments\nassociated with a derivative position will be\ntreated as part of that position for the\npurposes of calculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the Underlying Index.\nFor example, each of the Municipal Bond Funds\nmay invest in municipal bonds not included in\nits Underlying Index in order to reflect\nprospective changes in its Underlying Index\n(such as index reconstitutions, additions and\ndeletions). Each of the iShares California\nMuni Bond ETF and iShares New York Muni Bond\nETF generally holds municipal bond securities\nissued by its respective state and local\nmunicipalities whose interest payments are\nexempt from U.S. federal and state income tax,\nthe federal alternative minimum tax ( \u201c AMT \u201d\n), and the federal Medicare contribution tax\nof 3.8% on \u201c net investment income. \u201d Each of\nthe iShares National Muni Bond ETF and iShares\nShort-Term National Muni Bond ETF will\ngenerally hold municipal bond securities\nissued by state and local municipalities whose\ninterest payments are exempt from U.S. federal\nincome tax, the federal AMT, and the federal\nMedicare contribution tax of 3.8% on \u201c net\ninvestment income. \u201d In addition, each\nMunicipal Bond Fund intends to invest any cash\nassets in one or more affiliated municipal\nmoney market funds, which may be advised by\nBFA or its affiliates. Asset-Backed Securities\nRisk. Asset-backed securities ( \u201c ABS \u201d )\nrepresent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of assets,\nincluding consumer loans or receivables held\nin trust. ABS are \u201c pass-through \u201d securities,\nmeaning that principal and interest payments,\nnet of expenses, made by the borrower on the\nunderlying assets are passed through to a\nFund. ABS, like traditional fixed-income\nsecurities, are subject to credit, interest\nrate, call, prepayment, extension, valuation\nand illiquidity risk. Because of call,\nprepayment, and extension risk, however, ABS\nreact differently to changes in interest rates\nthan other bonds. Small movements in interest\nrates (both increases and decreases) may\nquickly and significantly reduce the value of\ncertain ABS.\n\n4\n\nThe price paid by a Fund for its ABS, the\nyield a Fund expects to receive from such\nsecurities and the average life of such\nsecurities are based on a number of factors,\nincluding the anticipated rate of prepayment\nof the underlying assets. During periods of\ndifficulty in the credit markets, ABS may\ndecline in value and become less liquid, more\nvolatile, and more difficult to value. The\nnature of the assets and the servicing of\nthose assets may subject ABS to additional\nrisks in comparison to mortgage-backed\nsecurities. For instance, certain ABS\ngenerally do not have the benefit of a\nsecurity interest in collateral that is\ncomparable in quality to mortgage-backed\nassets. The value of the collateral may also\nbe insufficient to cover the principal amount\nof the obligation. Other ABS, such as those\nbacked by credit card receivables, do not have\nthe benefit of a security interest in\ncollateral at all. Moreover, the values of ABS\nmay be substantially dependent on the\nservicing of the underlying asset pools, and\nare therefore subject to risks associated with\nthe negligence or malfeasance by their\nservicers and to the credit risk of their\nservicers. ABS are often not backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S. government\nand are subject to risk of default on the\nunderlying asset, particularly during periods\nof economic downturn. Bonds. Each Fund invests\na substantial portion of its assets in U.S.\ndollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an\ninterest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or\nnon-U.S. company or governmental unit. The\nissuer of a bond has a contractual obligation\nto pay interest at a stated rate on specific\ndates and to repay principal (the bond\u2019s face\nvalue) periodically or on a specified maturity\ndate. Bonds generally are used by issuers to\nborrow money from investors. An issuer may\nhave the right to redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond\nbefore maturity, in which case the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the proceeds at lower market\nrates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest\ninterest income or payments received when\nbonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates.\nMost bonds bear interest income at a \u201c coupon\n\u201d rate that is fixed for the life of the bond.\nThe value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises\nwhen market interest rates fall, and falls\nwhen market interest rates rise. Accordingly,\na fixed-rate bond\u2019s yield (income as a percent\nof the bond\u2019s current value) may differ from\nits coupon rate as its value rises or falls.\nWhen an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond\nat a price that is greater than its face\nvalue, the investor is purchasing the bond at\na premium. Conversely, when an investor\npurchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is\nless than its face value, the investor is\npurchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate\nbonds that are purchased at a discount pay\nless current income than securities with\ncomparable yields that are purchased at face\nvalue, with the result that prices for such\nfixed-rate securities can be more volatile\nthan prices for such securities that are\npurchased at face value. Other types of bonds\nbear interest at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Interest rates on \u201c\nfloating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds may\nbe higher or lower than current market rates\nfor fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality\nwith similar final maturities. Because of\ntheir adjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201c floating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline\nif their interest rates do not rise as much,\nor as quickly, as interest rates in general.\nEach Fund may treat some of these bonds as\nhaving a shorter maturity for purposes of\ncalculating the weighted average maturity of\nits investment portfolio. Generally, prices of\nhigher quality issues tend to fluctuate less\nwith changes in market interest rates than\nprices of lower quality issues and prices of\nlonger maturity issues tend to fluctuate more\nthan prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on an issuer\u2019s earnings and assets and,\nin the event of liquidation, are paid before\nsubordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (backed by\nspecified collateral). Borrowing. Each Fund\nmay borrow for temporary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The iShares\n0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short\nTreasury Bond ETF, along with certain other\niShares funds, have entered into a syndicated\nline of credit with the Bank of New York\nMellon ( \u201c BNY \u201d ), which serves as\nadministrative agent for itself and the other\nbanks. The syndicated line of credit may be\nused for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding redemption, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings. Interest\nrates related to the syndicated line of credit\nare based on the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ) published by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York plus a spread.\nPursuant to the terms of the credit agreement,\nif SOFR were to cease being published or\nrepresentative, it would be replaced by a rate\nbased on an alternate benchmark selected by\nBNY. The purchase of securities while\nborrowings are outstanding may have the effect\nof leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of\nleverage increases a Fund\u2019s exposure to risk,\nand borrowed funds are subject to interest\ncosts that will reduce net income. Purchasing\nsecurities while borrowings are outstanding\ncreates special risks, such as the potential\nfor greater volatility in the\n\n5\n\nNAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a\nFund\u2019s portfolio. In addition, the interest\nexpenses from borrowings may exceed the income\ngenerated by a Fund\u2019s portfolio and,\ntherefore, the amount available (if any) for\ndistribution to shareholders as dividends may\nbe reduced. BFA may determine to maintain\noutstanding borrowings if it expects that the\nbenefits to a Fund\u2019s shareholders will\noutweigh the current reduced return. Certain\ntypes of borrowings by a Fund must be made\nfrom a bank or may result in a Fund being\nsubject to covenants in credit agreements\nrelating to asset coverage, portfolio\ncomposition requirements and other matters. It\nis not anticipated that observance of such\ncovenants would impede BFA\u2019s management of a\nFund\u2019s portfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Brady Bonds. Certain\nof the Funds may invest in Brady bonds. Brady\nbonds are securities created through the\nexchange of existing commercial bank loans to\npublic and private entities in certain\nemerging markets for new bonds in connection\nwith debt restructurings. Brady bonds have\nbeen issued since 1989. In light of the\nhistory of defaults of countries issuing Brady\nbonds on their commercial bank loans,\ninvestments in Brady bonds may be viewed as\nspeculative and subject to the same risks as\nemerging market securities. Brady bonds may be\nfully or partially collateralized or\nuncollateralized, are issued in U.S. dollars\nand are actively traded in over-the-counter (\n\u201c OTC \u201d ) secondary markets. Incomplete\ncollateralization of interest or principal\npayment obligations results in increased\ncredit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated\ncollateralized Brady bonds, which may be\neither fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are\ngenerally collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. Commercial Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities Risk. The commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities ( \u201c CMBS \u201d ) in which a Fund\ninvests may be issued by entities, such as\nbanks, mortgage lenders or other institutions.\nThese entities are not backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. government, and\nthere can be no assurance that the U.S.\ngovernment would provide financial support to\nits agencies or instrumentalities where it is\nnot obligated to do so. CMBS depend on cash\nflows generated by underlying commercial real-\nestate loans, receivables or other assets, and\ncan be significantly affected by changes in\ninterest rates, the availability of\ninformation concerning the underlying assets\nand their structure, and the creditworthiness\nof the originators of the underlying assets.\nDue to the nature of the loans they represent,\nCMBS are subject to a greater degree of\nprepayment and extension risk than many other\nforms of fixed-income securities. Small\nmovements in interest rates (both increases\nand decreases) may quickly and significantly\nreduce the value of certain CMBS. Certain CMBS\nare issued in several classes with different\nlevels of yield and credit protection. A\nFund\u2019s investments in CMBS with several\nclasses may be in the lower classes that have\ngreater risks than the higher classes,\nincluding greater interest rate, credit,\nprepayment and extension risks. In addition,\nthe value of CMBS may be adversely affected by\nregulatory or tax changes. CMBS issued by non-\ngovernment entities may offer higher yields\nthan those issued by government entities, but\nalso may be subject to greater volatility than\ngovernment issues. In the recent past, the\nmarket for CMBS has experienced volatility and\nreduced liquidity. Corporate Bonds. Each Fund\n(other than the iShares ESG Advanced Total USD\nBond Market ETF, Treasury Bond Funds and the\nMunicipal Bond Funds) may invest in\ninvestment-grade and/or high yield corporate\nbonds. High yield corporate bonds may be\ndeemed speculative and more volatile than\nhigher rated securities of similar maturity.\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest earned on the security and\nchanges in the market value of the security.\nThe market value of a corporate bond may be\naffected by changes in the market rate of\ninterest, the credit rating of the issuer, the\nissuer\u2019s performance and perceptions of the\nissuer in the marketplace. There is a risk\nthat the issuers of the securities may not be\nable to meet their obligations on interest or\nprincipal payments at the time called for by\nan instrument. Diversification Status.

Under the 1940 Act,\na fund cannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval.\n\n7\n\nA \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund is a fund that is\nnot limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect a fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject the fund\u2019s shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby more diversified investment companies. Each\nFund (whether diversified or non-diversified)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of certain Funds and may make it\nless likely that the Funds will meet their\nrespective investment objectives. Futures,\nOptions on Futures and Securities Options.\nFutures contracts, options on futures and\nsecurities options may be used by a Fund to\nsimulate investment in its Underlying Index,\nto facilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. Each Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund will not use futures, options on\nfutures or securities options for speculative\npurposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFunds, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. Certain of the Funds may purchase and\nwrite put and call options on futures\ncontracts that are traded on an exchange as a\nhedge against changes in value of their\nportfolio securities or in anticipation of the\npurchase of securities, and may enter into\nclosing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by a Fund to obtain access to securities\nin its Underlying Index or to dispose of\nsecurities in its Underlying Index at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that provided by its Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s objective of\ntracking its Underlying Index. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives\n\n8\n\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. Each Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nHigh Yield Securities. Certain Funds may\ninvest in non-investment grade securities.\nNon-investment grade or \u201c high yield \u201d fixed-\nincome or convertible securities are commonly\nknown to investors as \u201c junk bonds \u201d or \u201c high\nyield bonds. \u201d These are generally debt\nsecurities that are rated below investment\ngrade by one or more of the major rating\nagencies or are unrated securities that BFA\nbelieves are of comparable quality. While\ngenerally providing greater income and\nopportunity for gain, non-investment grade\ndebt securities may be subject to greater\nrisks than securities that have higher credit\nratings, including a high risk of default, and\ntheir yields will fluctuate over time. High\nyield securities will generally be in the\nlower rating categories of recognized rating\nagencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc. ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or\nbelow BBB- by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global\nRatings, a subsidiary of S&P Global ( \u201c S&P\nGlobal Ratings \u201d ) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c\nFitch \u201d )) or be unrated. The credit rating of\na high yield security does not necessarily\naddress its market value risk, and ratings may\nfrom time to time change, positively or\nnegatively, to reflect developments regarding\nthe issuer\u2019s financial condition. High yield\nsecurities are considered to be speculative\nwith respect to the capacity of the issuer to\ntimely repay principal and pay interest in\naccordance with the terms of the obligation\nand may have more credit risk than higher\nrated securities. The major risks of high\nyield bond investments include the following:\n\u2022 High yield bonds may be issued by less\ncreditworthy issuers. These securities are\nvulnerable to adverse changes in the issuer\u2019s\nindustry or to general economic conditions.\nIssuers of high yield bonds may be unable to\nmeet their interest or principal payment\nobligations because of an economic downturn,\nspecific issuer developments or the\nunavailability of additional financing. \u2022 The\nissuers of high yield bonds may have a larger\namount of outstanding debt relative to their\nassets than issuers of investment grade bonds.\nIf the issuer experiences financial stress, it\nmay be unable to meet its debt obligations.\nThe issuer\u2019s ability to pay its debt\nobligations also may be lessened by specific\nissuer developments, or the unavailability of\nadditional financing. Issuers of high yield\nsecurities are often in the growth stage of\ntheir development and/or involved in a\nreorganization or takeover. \u2022 High yield bonds\nare frequently ranked junior to claims by\nother creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its\nobligations, the senior obligations are\ngenerally paid off before the junior\nobligations, which will potentially limit a\nFund\u2019s ability to fully recover principal, to\nreceive interest payments when senior\nsecurities are in default or to receive\nrestructuring benefits paid to holders of more\nsenior classes of debt. Thus, investors in\nhigh yield securities frequently have a lower\ndegree of protection with respect to principal\nand interest payments than do investors in\nhigher rated securities. \u2022 High yield bonds\nfrequently have redemption features that\npermit an issuer to repurchase the security\nfrom a Fund before it matures. If an issuer\nredeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have\nto invest the proceeds in bonds with lower\nyields and may lose income. \u2022 Prices of high\nyield bonds are subject to extreme\nfluctuations. Negative economic developments\nmay have a greater impact on the prices of\nhigh yield bonds than on those of other higher\nrated fixed-income securities. \u2022 Under certain\neconomic and/or market conditions, a Fund may\nhave difficulty disposing of certain high\nyield securities due to the limited number of\ninvestors in that sector of the market. There\nare fewer dealers in the high yield bond\nmarket, and there may be significant\ndifferences in the prices quoted for high\nyield bonds by dealers, and such quotations\nmay not be the actual prices available for a\npurchase or sale. Judgment may play a greater\nrole in the prices and values generated for\nsuch securities than in the case of securities\ntrading in a more liquid market. \u2022 The\nsecondary markets for high yield securities\nare not as liquid as the secondary markets for\nhigher rated\n\n9\n\nsecurities. The secondary markets for high\nyield securities are concentrated in\nrelatively few market makers and, participants\nin the markets are mostly institutional\ninvestors, including insurance companies,\nbanks, other financial institutions and mutual\nfunds. In addition, the trading volume for\nhigh yield securities is generally lower than\nthat for higher rated securities and the\nsecondary markets could contract under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the condition\nof a particular issuer. Under certain economic\nand/or market conditions, a Fund may have\ndifficulty disposing of certain high yield\nsecurities due to the limited number of\ninvestors in that sector of the market. An\nilliquid secondary market may adversely affect\nthe market price of the high yield security,\nwhich may result in increased difficulty\nselling the particular issue and obtaining\naccurate market quotations on the issue when\nvaluing a Fund's assets. Market quotations on\nhigh yield securities are available only from\na limited number of dealers, and such\nquotations may not be the actual prices\navailable for a purchase or sale. When the\nsecondary market for high yield securities\nbecomes more illiquid, or in the absence of\nreadily available market quotations for such\nsecurities, the relative lack of reliable\nobjective data makes it more difficult to\nvalue such securities, and judgment plays a\nmore important role in determining such\nvaluations. \u2022 A Fund may incur expenses to the\nextent necessary to seek recovery upon default\nor to negotiate new terms with a defaulting\nissuer. \u2022 The high yield bond markets may\nreact strongly to adverse news about an issuer\nor the economy, or to the perception or\nexpectation of adverse news, whether or not it\nis based on fundamental analysis.\nAdditionally, prices for high yield securities\nmay be affected by legislative and regulatory\ndevelopments. These developments could\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s NAV and investment\npractices, the secondary market for high yield\nsecurities, the financial condition of issuers\nof these securities and the value and\nliquidity of outstanding high yield\nsecurities, especially in a thinly traded\nmarket. For example, federal legislation\nrequiring the divestiture by federally insured\nsavings and loan associations of their\ninvestments in high yield bonds and limiting\nthe deductibility of interest by certain\ncorporate issuers of high yield bonds\nadversely affected the market in the past.\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the particular Fund\nexceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's\ntotal assets (including the value of the\ncollateral received). A Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Funds are compensated\nby any positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for certain Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\n\n10\n\nelection as determined by the Funds'\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Funds, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews each Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by a Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that a Fund could\nnot meet requests to redeem shares issued by a\nFund without significant dilution of the\nremaining investors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The\nliquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Municipal Insurance. A\nmunicipal security may be covered by insurance\nthat guarantees the bond\u2019s scheduled payment\nof interest and repayment of principal. This\ntype of insurance may be obtained by either\n(i) the issuer at the time the bond is issued\n(primary market insurance), or (ii) another\nparty after the bond has been issued\n(secondary market insurance). Both primary and\nsecondary market insurance guarantee timely\nand scheduled repayment of all principal and\npayment of all interest on a municipal\nsecurity in the event of default by the\nissuer, and cover a municipal security to its\nmaturity, enhancing its credit quality and\nvalue. Municipal security insurance does not\ninsure against market fluctuations or\nfluctuations in each of the Municipal Bond\nFunds' share price. In addition, a municipal\nsecurity insurance policy will not cover: (i)\nrepayment of a municipal security before\nmaturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of\nprincipal or interest caused by negligence or\nbankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii)\nprepayment or payment of an acceleration\npremium (except for a mandatory sinking fund\nredemption) or any other provision of a bond\nindenture that advances the maturity of the\nbond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may\nbe a provision of a municipal security issue\nwhereby part of the municipal security issue\nmay be retired before maturity. Because a\nsignificant portion of the municipal\nsecurities issued and outstanding are insured\nby a small number of insurance companies, an\nevent involving one or more of these insurance\ncompanies could have a significant adverse\neffect on the value of the securities insured\nby that insurance company and on the municipal\nmarkets as a whole.\n\n11\n\nCertain significant providers of insurance for\nmunicipal securities have recently incurred\nsignificant losses as a result of exposure to\nsub-prime mortgages and other lower credit\nquality investments that have experienced\nrecent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme\ncredit deterioration. As a result, such losses\nhave reduced the insurers\u2019 capital and called\ninto question their continued ability to\nperform their obligations under such insurance\nif they are called upon to do so in the\nfuture. While an insured municipal security\nwill typically be deemed to have the rating of\nits insurer, if the insurer of a municipal\nsecurity suffers a downgrade in its credit\nrating or if the market discounts the value of\nthe insurance provided by the insurer, the\nvalue of the municipal security would be more,\nif not entirely, dependent on the rating of\nthe municipal security independent of\ninsurance. Municipal Securities. Certain of\nthe Funds invest in securities issued in the\nU.S. market by U.S. states and territories,\nmunicipalities and other political\nsubdivisions, agencies, authorities and\ninstrumentalities of states and multi-state\nagencies or authorities ( \u201c municipal\nsecurities \u201d ), the interest payments of which\nare not subject to U.S. federal income tax.\nThe municipal securities which such Funds may\npurchase include general obligation bonds and\nlimited obligation bonds (or \u201c Revenue Bonds \u201d\n), including industrial development bonds\nissued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax\nlaw. General obligation bonds are obligations\ninvolving the credit of an issuer possessing\ntaxing power and are payable from such\nissuer\u2019s general revenues and not from any\nparticular source. Revenue Bonds are payable\nonly from the revenues derived from a\nparticular facility or class of facilities or,\nin some cases, from the proceeds of a special\nexcise or other specific revenue source.\nRevenue Bonds that are issued to finance a\nparticular project often depend on revenues\nfrom that project to make principal and\ninterest payments. Adverse conditions and\ndevelopments affecting a particular project\ncan result in lower revenues to the issuer of\nthe municipal securities. Additionally, the\nmarket values of Revenue Bonds may decline in\ntimes of higher inflation to the extent that\nrevenues are fixed income streams. In other\ninstances, the prices that certain Revenue\nBond issuers are able to charge users of their\nassets may be linked to inflation, whether by\ngovernment regulation, contractual arrangement\nor other factors. In this case, changes in the\nrate of inflation may affect the issuer\u2019s\nrevenues. Additionally, rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nissuers of both general obligation bonds and\nRevenue Bonds, which could negatively impact\ntheir ability to meet payment obligations. The\nmarket for municipal bonds may be less liquid\nthan for taxable bonds. This means that it may\nbe harder to buy and sell municipal\nsecurities, especially on short notice, than\nnon-municipal securities. In addition, the\nmunicipal securities market is generally\ncharacterized as a buy and hold investment\nstrategy. As a result, the accessibility of\nmunicipal securities in the market is\ngenerally greater closer to the original date\nof issue of the securities and lessens as the\nsecurities move further away from such\nissuance date. Some longer-term municipal\nsecurities give the investor the right to \u201c\nput \u201d or sell the security at par (face value)\nwithin a specified number of days following\nthe investor\u2019s request - usually one to seven\ndays. This demand feature enhances a\nsecurity\u2019s liquidity by shortening its\neffective maturity and enables it to trade at\na price equal to or very close to par. If a\ndemand feature terminates prior to being\nexercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term\nsecurity, which could experience substantially\nmore volatility. Municipal securities are\nsubject to credit and market risk. Generally,\nprices of higher quality issues tend to\nfluctuate more with changes in market interest\nrates than prices of lower quality issues and\nprices of longer maturity issues tend to\nfluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity\nissues. Prices and yields on municipal\nsecurities are dependent on a variety of\nfactors, including general money-market\nconditions, the financial condition of the\nissuer, general conditions of the municipal\nsecurity market, the size of a particular\noffering, the maturity of the obligation and\nthe rating of the issue. A number of these\nfactors, including the ratings of particular\nissues, are subject to change from time to\ntime. Information about the financial\ncondition of an issuer of municipal securities\nmay not be as extensive as that which is made\navailable by corporations whose securities are\npublicly-traded. As a result, municipal\nsecurities may be more difficult to value than\nsecurities of public corporations. Obligations\nof issuers of municipal securities are subject\nto insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations\nof corporate issuers, may not be subject to\nresolution in the event of insolvency or\ndefault through a bankruptcy proceeding. The\nU.S. Congress or state legislatures may seek\nto extend the time for payment of principal or\ninterest, or both, or to impose other\nconstraints upon enforcement of such\nobligations. In addition, municipal securities\nare subject to the risk that their tax\ntreatment could be changed, thereby affecting\nthe value of outstanding municipal securities.\nThere is also the possibility that as a result\nof litigation or other conditions, such as\npassing of a referendum, the power or ability\nof issuers to meet their obligations for the\npayment of interest and principal on their\nmunicipal securities may be materially\naffected or their obligations may be found\n\n12\n\nto be invalid or unenforceable. Such\nlitigation or conditions may from time to time\nhave the effect of introducing uncertainties\nin the market for municipal securities or\ncertain segments thereof, or of materially\naffecting the credit risk with respect to\nparticular bonds. Adverse economic, business,\nlegal or political developments might affect\nall or a substantial portion of a Fund\u2019s\nmunicipal securities in the same manner.\nAdditionally, certain municipal securities are\nissued by entities dependent on revenue from a\nparticular sector and thus are subject to the\nspecific risks associated with that sector.\nThese sectors are described in more detail\nbelow. Risk of Investing in Health Care-\nRelated Municipal Securities. Changes to state\nor federal policy tied to health care services\ncould adversely affect the value of municipal\nsecurities backed by revenue from public\nhospitals and other health care facilities.\nRegulatory changes that govern cost\nreimbursements to health care providers under\ngovernment-funded programs such as Medicare\nand Medicaid, including policies that award\nexclusive contracts to certain hospitals, may\nadversely affect the revenue streams backing\ncertain municipal securities. Additionally,\nthe expansion of healthcare facilities by some\nissuers may be subject to \u201c determinations of\nneed \u201d by various regulators or other\nauthorities. This process not only generally\nincreases the time and expenses such\nexpansions entail, but also makes expansion\nplans uncertain, thus potentially limiting the\nrevenue and growth of healthcare facility\noperators. Moreover, local, state and federal\ngovernmental bodies are under increasing\npressure to reduce medical spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nservices and facilities. The value of\nhealthcare-related municipal securities could\nalso be affected by a variety of other factors\nthat impact the underlying healthcare\nfacilities including demand for services, the\nability of the health care facility to provide\nthe services required, competition with other\nfacilities, and expenses (such as malpractice\ninsurance premiums). Risk of Investing in\nInfrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.\nEntities that issue municipal securities\nrelated to infrastructure ( \u201c infrastructure\nissuers \u201d ) may be subject to a variety of\nfactors that could adversely affect their\ncapacity to make principal and interest\npayments, such as high interest costs in\nconnection with capital construction programs,\nhigh degrees of leverage, costs associated\nwith governmental, environmental and other\nregulations, the effects of economic\nslowdowns, increased competition from other\nproviders of services, uncertainties\nconcerning costs, the level of government\nspending on infrastructure projects, and other\nfactors. Such issuers may be adversely\naffected by commodity price volatility,\nchanges in exchange rates, import controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological\ndevelopments, and labor relations.\nInfrastructure issuers can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies.\nLeverage Risk. Infrastructure issuers can be\nhighly indebted, which increases investment\nrisk and other risks normally associated with\ndebt financing, which could adversely affect\nsuch an issuer\u2019s operations and the market\nvalue of related municipal securities in\nperiods of rising interest rates. Operations\nRisk. The failure of an infrastructure issuer\nto carry adequate insurance or to operate its\nassets appropriately could lead to significant\nlosses. Infrastructure may be adversely\naffected by environmental clean-up costs and\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts. Regulatory\nRisk. Infrastructure projects may be subject\nto significant regulation by various\ngovernmental authorities and also may be\naffected by regulation of rates charged to\ncustomers, service interruption due to\nenvironmental, operational or other events,\nthe imposition of special tariffs and changes\nin tax laws, regulatory policies and\naccounting standards. Strategic Asset Risk.\nInfrastructure issuers may control significant\nstrategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or\nhighways), which are assets that have a\nnational or regional profile, and may have\nmonopolistic characteristics. Given their\nnational or regional profile or irreplaceable\nnature, strategic assets could generate\nadditional risk not common in other industry\nsectors and they may be targeted for terrorist\nacts or adverse political actions. User Risk.\nInfrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a\nnarrow user base. If these users do not\npatronize infrastructure projects as expected,\nsignificant revenues could be lost and may not\nbe replaceable, in which case infrastructure\nissuers may fail to pay their obligations.\nRisk of Investing in Municipal Securities\nIssued By School Districts. School districts\nrely, in part, on funding appropriations from,\namong others, the federal government and state\ngovernments. As a result, municipal securities\nissued by school districts may be adversely\naffected by political and economic changes at\nthe state or federal levels, such as decreased\ntax or other revenues, spending reductions or\nchanges in appropriations. Investors in these\nsecurities, similar to investors in municipal\nsecurities generally, face heightened risk of\nloss upon insolvency of the school district\nissuers because there is often no ready source\nof funding to pay the bonds other than the\nlocal tax base, which a bankruptcy court or\nadministrator does not control.\n\n13\n\nRisk of Investing in Transportation\nInfrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.\nThe transportation infrastructure industry may\nbe adversely affected by economic changes,\nincreases in fuel and other operating costs,\nlabor relations, insurance costs, and, in many\njurisdictions, the effects of regulatory\nchanges or other government decisions.\nMunicipal securities that are issued to\nfinance a particular transportation project\n(e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues\nfrom that project to make principal and\ninterest payments. Risk of Investing in\nUtility-Related Municipal Securities. Certain\nmunicipal securities are issued by public\nbodies, including state and municipal utility\nauthorities, to, among other things, finance\nthe operation or expansion of utility\nentities. Various future economic and other\nconditions may adversely affect utility\nentities, including inflation, increases in\nfinancing requirements, increases in raw\nmaterial costs and other operating costs,\nchanges in demand for services and the effects\nof environmental and other governmental\nregulations. Certain utilities are subject to\nspecific risks. For example, gas utilities are\nsubject to risks of supply conditions and\nincreased competition from other providers of\nutility services. In addition, gas utilities\nare affected by gas prices, which may be\nmagnified to the extent that a gas utility\nenters into long-term contracts for the\npurchase or sale of gas at a fixed price,\nsince such prices may change significantly and\nto the disadvantage of the gas utility. The\ntypes of municipal securities in which the\nFunds may invest include, but are not limited,\nto the following: Industrial Development Bonds\nIndustrial development bonds generally are\nalso Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable\nfrom the issuer\u2019s general revenues. The credit\nand quality of industrial development bonds\nare usually related to the credit of the\ncorporate user of the facilities. Payment of\ninterest on and repayment of principal of such\nbonds is the responsibility of the corporate\nuser (and/or any guarantor). Private Activity\nBonds Certain of the Funds may invest in\nprivate activity bonds, which are bonds issued\nby or on behalf of public authorities to\nobtain funds to provide privately operated\nhousing facilities, airport, mass transit or\nport facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste\ndisposal or hazardous waste treatment or\ndisposal facilities and certain local\nfacilities for water supply, gas or\nelectricity. Other types of private activity\nbonds, the proceeds of which are used for the\nconstruction, equipment, repair or improvement\nof privately operated industrial or commercial\nfacilities, may constitute municipal\nsecurities, although the current U.S. federal\ntax laws place substantial limitations on the\nsize of such issues. Municipal Lease\nObligations The Funds may invest in municipal\nlease obligations, including certificates of\nparticipation ( \u201c COPs \u201d ) issued by\ngovernment authorities or entities to finance\nthe acquisition or construction of equipment,\nland and/or facilities. The COPs represent\nparticipations in a lease, an installment\npurchase contract, or a conditional sales\ncontract relating to equipment, land or\nfacilities. As a result of their structure,\nCOPs are generally not subject to\nconstitutional debt limitations or other\nstatutory requirements that may apply to other\nmunicipal securities. Municipal governments\nmay not be obligated to make lease or\ninstallment purchase payments in connection\nwith COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP\nwill be secured only by the leased property.\nIf the issuer of a COP does not fulfill its\npayment obligation, it may be difficult to\nsell the property and the proceeds of a sale\nmay not cover the Fund\u2019s loss. Municipal lease\nobligations may be less liquid than\nconventional municipal bonds, but otherwise\nhave the same general risk characteristics as\nother municipal securities. Tender Option\nBonds Tender option bonds are synthetic\nfloating rate or variable rate securities\nissued when long-term bonds are purchased in\nthe primary or secondary market and then\ndeposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are\nthen issued to investors in these securities\nevidencing ownership interests in the trust.\nThe remarketing agent for the trust sets a\nfloating or variable rate on typically a\nweekly basis. The sponsor of a highly\nleveraged tender option bond trust generally\nwill retain a liquidity provider to purchase\nthe short-term floating rate interests at\ntheir original purchase price upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events.\nHowever, the liquidity provider may not be\nrequired to purchase the floating rate\ninterests upon the occurrence of certain other\nevents, for example, the downgrading of the\nmunicipal bonds owned by the tender option\nbond trust below investment-grade or certain\nevents that indicate the issuer of the bonds\nmay be entering bankruptcy. The general effect\nof these provisions is to pass to the holders\nof the floating rate interests the most severe\ncredit risks associated with the\n\n14\n\nmunicipal bonds owned by the tender option\nbond trust and to leave with the liquidity\nprovider the interest rate risk (subject to a\ncap) and certain other risks associated with\nthe municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may\nbe considered derivatives, and may expose the\nFunds to the same risks as investments in\nderivatives, as well as risks associated with\nleverage, especially the risk of increased\nvolatility. To the extent the Funds invest in\ntender option bonds, they also are exposed to\ncredit risk associated with the liquidity\nprovider retained by the sponsor of a tender\nbond option trust. Variable Rate Demand\nObligations Variable rate demand obligations (\n\u201c VRDOs \u201d ) are tax-exempt obligations that\ncontain a floating or variable interest rate\nadjustment formula and a right of demand on\nthe part of the holder thereof to receive\npayment of the unpaid principal balance plus\naccrued interest upon a short notice period\nnot to exceed seven days. There is the\npossibility that because of default or\ninsolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not\nbe honored. The interest rates are adjustable\nat intervals (ranging from daily to up to one\nyear) to some prevailing market rate for\nsimilar investments, such adjustment formula\nbeing calculated to maintain the market rate\nof the VRDOs at approximately the par value of\nthe VRDOs on the adjustment date. The\nadjustments typically are based upon the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation Index or some other appropriate\ninterest rate adjustment index. Because of the\ninterest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are\nnot comparable to fixed-rate securities.\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, a\nFund\u2019s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its\nshareholders will forego the opportunity for\ncapital appreciation. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, however, a Fund\u2019s yield on a\nVRDO will increase and its shareholders will\nhave a reduced risk of capital depreciation.\nMunicipal Notes Municipal notes (also known as\nmunicipal commercial paper) are shorter-term\nmunicipal debt obligations. They may provide\ninterim financing in anticipation of tax\ncollection, receipt of grants, bond sales or\nrevenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in\nthe anticipated proceeds, repayment on a\nmunicipal note may be delayed or the note may\nnot be fully repaid, and the Funds may lose\nmoney. Municipal commercial paper is generally\nunsecured and issued to meet short-term\nfinancing needs. The lack of security presents\nsome risk of loss to the Funds since, in the\nevent of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy, unsecured\ncreditors are repaid only out of the assets,\nif any, that remain after secured creditors\nare repaid. Non-U.S. Securities. Certain\nobligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers\nmay be deemed to be located in a particular\ncountry if: (i) the principal trading market\nfor the security is in such country, (ii) the\nissuer is organized under the laws of such\ncountry, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50%\nof its revenues or profits from such country\nor has at least 50% of its assets situated in\nsuch country or, (iv) the issuer is the\ngovernment of the particular country.\nPrivately Issued Securities. The iShares Core\n5-10 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core 10+\nYear USD Bond ETF may not invest in private\nplacements, but may invest in certain bonds\nregistered with the SEC or exempt from\nregistration at the time of issuance, or\noffered pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933\nAct with or without registration rights ( \u201c\nRule 144A Bonds \u201d ).The iShares 1-5 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF, iShares BBB Rated Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares Broad USD Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD\nBond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF,\niShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares\nESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares Government/Credit Bond ETF,\niShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF and iShares Intermediate\nGovernment/Credit Bond ETF may invest in\nprivately issued securities, including those\nthat may be resold only in accordance with\nRule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act (\n\u201c Restricted Securities \u201d ). Rule 144A Bonds\nand Restricted Securities are not publicly-\ntraded and are subject to a variety of\nrestrictions, which limit a purchaser's\nability to acquire or resell such securities.\nAccordingly, the liquidity of the market for\nspecific Rule 144A Bonds and Restricted\nSecurities may vary. Delay or difficulty in\nselling such securities may result in a loss\nto a Fund. Ratings. An investment-grade rating\ngenerally means the security or issuer is\nrated investment-grade by one or more of\nMoody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another\ncredit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization ( \u201c NRSRO \u201d ) by the SEC, or is\nunrated but considered to be of equivalent\nquality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated\n\n15\n\nBaa3 or above by Moody\u2019s or BBB- or above by\nS&P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered \u201c\ninvestment-grade \u201d securities, bonds rated Baa\nare considered medium grade obligations\nsubject to moderate credit risk and may\npossess certain speculative characteristics,\nwhile bonds rated BBB are regarded as having\nadequate capacity to meet financial\ncommitments. Subsequent to purchase by a Fund,\na rated security may cease to be rated or its\nrating may be reduced below an investment-\ngrade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by\nMoody\u2019s or below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or\nFitch are considered below investment-grade\nquality and are obligations of issuers that\nare generally considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer\u2019s\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and,\ntherefore, carry greater investment risk,\nincluding the possibility of issuer default\nand bankruptcy and increased market price\nvolatility. Such lower-rated securities are\ncommonly referred to as \u201c junk bonds \u201d and are\nsubject to a substantial degree of credit\nrisk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a\ndescription of each rating category of\nMoody's, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch and\nBFA's treatment of investments that are not\nrated by any of the rating agencies.\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives. The CFTC\nsubjects advisers to registered investment\ncompanies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund\nthat is advised by the adviser either (i)\ninvests, directly or indirectly, more than a\nprescribed level of its liquidation value in\nCFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps ( \u201c\nCFTC Derivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in a Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions (e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities (e.g., firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board.\n\n16\n\nRule 18f-4 provides an exception from the\nDRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements\nif a Fund's \u201c derivatives exposure \u201d (as\ndefined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of\nits net assets (as calculated in accordance\nwith Rule 18f-4) and the Fund adopts and\nimplements written policies and procedures\nreasonably designed to manage its derivatives\nrisks (the \u201c Limited Derivatives User\nException \u201d ). The iShares 1-5 Year Investment\nGrade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares\nCore 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S.\nAggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S.\nAggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares High Yield\nSystematic Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ High\nYield Corporate Bond ETF and iShares MBS ETF\n(the \u201c No-Action Letter Funds \u201d ) may also\nhave investments in \u201c underlying funds \u201d (and\nsuch underlying funds themselves may invest in\nunderlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term\n\u201c underlying fund \u201d for purposes of the no-\naction letter referenced below may include,\nbut is not limited to, certain securitized\nvehicles, mortgage or international real\nestate investment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ),\nbusiness development companies and, investment\ncompanies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives\nor in any of the foregoing), and therefore may\nbe viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA\nmay not have transparency into the holdings of\nthese underlying funds because they are not\nadvised by BFA. To address this issue of lack\nof transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for the Funds to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of the Funds.\nRepurchase Agreements. A repurchase agreement\nis an instrument under which the purchaser (\ni.e. , a Fund) acquires a security and the\nseller agrees, at the time of the sale, to\nrepurchase the security at a mutually agreed-\nupon time and price, thereby determining the\nyield during the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund that utilizes them. Such risks are not\nunique to the Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Funds seek to\nminimize such risks, but because of the\ninherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, a Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition a Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it\n\n17\n\nwill be advantageous to the Fund. The use of\nreverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate\nany increase or decrease in the value of a\nFund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements is a form of leverage, and the\nproceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse\nrepurchase agreements may be invested in\nadditional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law,\nregulation, exemptive order or SEC staff\nguidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund\u2019s\ninvestment in investment companies is limited\nto, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting stock of any one\ninvestment company, (ii) 5% of the fund\u2019s\ntotal assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which a Fund invests can be\nexpected to incur fees and expenses for\noperations, such as investment advisory and\nadministration fees, which would be in\naddition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant\nto guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and\nexpenses of money market funds used for cash\ncollateral received in connection with loans\nof securities are not treated as acquired fund\nfees and expenses, which reflect a Fund's pro\nrata share of the fees and expenses incurred\nby investing in other investment companies (as\ndisclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).\nThe iShares National Muni Bond ETF may invest\nin shares of other iShares funds that provide\nsubstantially similar exposure to the\nsecurities in its Underlying Index. BFA will\nnot charge advisory fees on that portion of\nthe iShares National Muni Bond ETF\u2019s assets\ninvested in shares of other iShares funds. The\niShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF may\ninvest in shares of other registered\ninvestment companies advised by BFA, or its\naffiliates that provide substantially similar\nexposure to the securities in its Underlying\nIndex. BFA will not charge advisory fees on\nthat portion of the iShares Core U.S.\nAggregate Bond ETF's assets invested in shares\nof other registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA, or its affiliates. Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. Each\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding variable rate demand notes, short-\nterm municipal securities, short-term\nmunicipal money market funds and money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019\nacceptances, fixed-time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global\nRatings, or if unrated, of comparable quality\nas determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of\nthese instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign\nObligations. Certain of the Funds may invest\nin sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations.\nAn investment in sovereign debt obligations\ninvolves special risks not present in\ncorporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt\nincludes securities issued or guaranteed by a\nforeign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign\ndebt includes securities issued or guaranteed\nby an entity affiliated with or backed by a\nsovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt\nobligations are typically less liquid and less\nstandardized than sovereign debt obligations.\nThe issuer of the sovereign debt that controls\nthe repayment of the debt may be unable or\nunwilling to repay principal or interest when\ndue, and a Fund may have limited recourse in\nthe event of a default. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of a non-U.S. government may\ncause the value of a sovereign debt to\ndecline. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the market prices of sovereign\ndebt obligations may be more volatile than\nprices of U.S. debt obligations, which may\naffect a Fund's NAV. In the past, certain\nemerging market countries have encountered\ndifficulties in servicing their debt\nobligations, withheld payments of principal\nand interest and declared moratoria on the\npayment of principal and interest on their\nsovereign debts. Several\n\n18\n\nsovereign issuers have experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\nrising government debt levels, including\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In\nthe past, sovereign issuers have also\ndefaulted on their debt obligations, including\nRussia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay. A\nsovereign debtor's willingness or ability to\nrepay principal and pay interest in a timely\nmanner may be affected by, among other\nfactors, its cash flow situation, the extent\nof its non-U.S. currency reserves, the\navailability of sufficient foreign exchange,\nthe relative size of the debt service burden,\nthe sovereign debtor's policy toward principal\ninternational lenders and local political\nconstraints. Sovereign debtors may also be\ndependent on expected disbursements from\nforeign governments, multilateral agencies and\nother entities to reduce principal and\ninterest arrears on their debt. The failure of\na sovereign debtor to implement economic\nreforms, achieve specified levels of economic\nperformance or repay principal or interest\nwhen due may result in the cancellation of\nthird-party commitments to lend funds to the\nsovereign debtor, which may further impair\nsuch debtor's ability or willingness to\nservice its debts. Quasi-sovereign debt\nobligations are typically less liquid and less\nstandardized than government debt. Swap\nAgreements. Swap agreements are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on a pre-determined underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. In return, the\nother party agrees to make periodic payments\nto the first party based on the return (or a\ndifferential in rate of return) earned or\nrealized on the underlying investment or\nnotional amount. Swap agreements will usually\nbe performed on a net basis, with a Fund\nreceiving or paying only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of a Fund\u2019s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis. Certain of the Funds\nmay enter into swap agreements, including\ncurrency swaps, interest rate swaps and index\nswaps. The use of swaps is a highly\nspecialized activity that involves investment\ntechniques and risks different from those\nassociated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. These transactions generally do\nnot involve the delivery of securities or\nother underlying assets. U.S. Agency Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Risk. Certain of the Funds\ninvest in securities backed by pools of\nmortgages issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment or one of its agencies or sponsored\nentities, including Government National\nMortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ),\nFederal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nFannie Mae \u201d ), and the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ). The\nmarket for mortgage-backed securities ( \u201c MBS\n\u201d ) has been adversely affected by the value\nof those MBS held and/or issued by these\nagencies and sponsored entities. If a U.S.\ngovernment agency or sponsored entity issues\nsecurities in which certain of the Funds\ninvest and such issuer is unable to meet its\nobligations or ceases to exist, and no plan is\nmade for the repayment of securities, the\nperformance of certain of the Funds will be\nadversely impacted. Ginnie Mae . Established\nin 1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S.\ngovernment corporation within the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\nGinnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with\nthe backing of the full faith and credit of\nthe U.S. government, the timely payment of\nprincipal and interest on securities issued by\nthe institutions approved by Ginnie Mae (such\nas savings and loan institutions, commercial\nbanks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools\nof mortgages insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration or guaranteed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae\nsecurities also are supported by the authority\nof Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S.\nTreasury Department to make payments under its\nguarantee. Any actual or potential disruption\nto Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or\ncredit of the U.S. government, could cause the\nvalue of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In\n2011, S&P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.\nTreasury securities from AAA rating to AA+\nrating. A further downgrade of the ratings of\nU.S. government debt obligations, which are\noften used as a benchmark for other borrowing\narrangements, could result in higher interest\nrates for individual and corporate borrowers,\ncause disruptions in the international bond\nmarkets and have a substantial negative effect\non the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S.\nTreasury securities from another ratings\nagency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating\nby S&P Global Ratings may cause the value of\nGinnie Mae securities to decline. Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac . Fannie Mae was established\nas a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was\nchartered by Congress as a private\nshareholder-owned company. Securities issued\nby Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely\npayment of principal and interest by Fannie\nMae. The securities are not backed by or\nentitled to the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government, but are supported by the\nright of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S.\nTreasury Department. Freddie Mac is a\nstockholder-owned corporation chartered by\nCongress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie\nMac entitle the holder to timely payment of\ninterests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate\ncollection or timely payment of all principal\npayments. While Freddie Mac generally does not\nguarantee timely payment of\n\n19\n\nprincipal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount\ndue on account of its guarantee of ultimate\npayment of principal at any time after default\non an underlying mortgage, but in no event\nlater than one year after it becomes payable.\nThe securities are not backed by or entitled\nto the full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment or by any Federal Home Loan Banks,\nbut are supported by the right of Freddie Mac\nto borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.\nIn 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nplaced each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into\ngovernment conservatorship in an effort to\nprovide stability in the financial markets and\nput the government-sponsored entities in sound\nand solvent condition. In addition, the U.S.\nTreasury Department agreed to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of\ncapital each on an as needed basis to ensure\nthat they continue to provide liquidity to the\nhousing and mortgage markets. Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities . MBS issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government or one of its agencies or\nsponsored entities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie\nMae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in\npools of mortgages in which payments of both\nprincipal and interest on the securities are\ngenerally made monthly, in effect \u201c passing\nthrough \u201d the payments made by borrowers on\nthe mortgage loans that underlie the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). MBS differ\nfrom other forms of debt securities, which\nnormally provide for periodic payment of\ninterest in fixed amounts with principal\npayments at maturity or specified call dates,\nwhile a MBS payments provide a combination of\ninterest and principal throughout the a bond\u2019s\nterm. As further described below, MBS may be\nstructured as pass-through securities or\ncollateralized mortgage obligations ( \u201c CMOs \u201d\n). MBS are subject to the general risks\nassociated with investing in real estate\nsecurities; that is, they may lose value if\nthe value of the underlying real estate to\nwhich a pool of mortgages relates declines. In\naddition, investments in MBS involve certain\nspecific risks. These risks include the\nfailure of a party to meet its commitments\nunder the related operative documents, adverse\ninterest rate changes and the effects of\nprepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value\nof MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income\nsecurities, typically increases when interest\nrates fall and decreases when interest rates\nrise. However, MBS differ from traditional\nfixed-income securities because of their\npotential for prepayment without penalty. The\nprice paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a\nFund expects to receive from such securities\nand the weighted average life of the\nsecurities are based on a number of factors,\nincluding the anticipated rate of prepayment\nof the underlying mortgages. In a period of\ndeclining interest rates, borrowers may prepay\nthe underlying mortgages more quickly than\nanticipated, thereby reducing the yield to\nmaturity and the average life of the MBS.\nMoreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds\nof a prepayment in these circumstances, it\nwill likely receive a rate of interest that is\nlower than the rate on the security that was\nprepaid. To the extent that a Fund purchases\nMBS at a premium, mortgage foreclosures and\nprincipal prepayments may result in a loss to\nthe extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys\nsuch securities at a discount, both scheduled\npayments of principal and unscheduled\nprepayments will increase current and total\nreturns and will accelerate the recognition of\nincome, which, when distributed to\nshareholders, will be taxable as ordinary\nincome. In a period of rising interest rates,\nprepayments of the underlying mortgages may\noccur at a slower than expected rate, creating\nmaturity extension risk. This particular risk\nmay effectively change a security that was\nconsidered short- or intermediate-term at the\ntime of purchase into a long-term security.\nSince the value of long-term securities\ngenerally fluctuates more widely in response\nto changes in interest rates than that of\nshorter-term securities, maturity extension\nrisk could increase the inherent volatility of\na Fund. Under certain interest rate and\nprepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to\nrecoup fully its investment in MBS\nnotwithstanding any direct or indirect U.S.\ngovernmental or agency guarantee. Mortgage\nPass-Through Securities . Some MBS, such as\nU.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities,\nrepresent a right to receive principal and\ninterest payments collected on a pool of\nmortgages, which are passed through to\nsecurity holders. In the basic mortgage pass-\nthrough structure, mortgages with similar\nissuer, term and coupon characteristics are\ncollected and aggregated into a \u201c pool \u201d\nconsisting of multiple mortgage loans. The\npool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided\ninterests in the pool are traded and sold as\npass-through securities. The holder of the\nsecurity is entitled to a pro rata share of\nprincipal and interest payments (including\nunscheduled prepayments) from the pool of\nmortgage loans. An investment in a specific\npool of mortgage pass-through securities\nrequires an analysis of the specific\nprepayment risk of mortgages within the\ncovered pool (since mortgagors typically have\nthe option to prepay their loans). The level\nof prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult\nto predict and can impact the subsequent cash\nflows, value and yield of the mortgage pool.\nIn addition, when trading specific mortgage\npools, precise execution, delivery and\nsettlement arrangements must be negotiated for\neach transaction.\n\n20\n\nTo-Be-Announced Securities . A Fund may seek\nto gain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities by investing in TBA\nsecurities. \u201c TBAs \u201d refer to a commonly used\nmechanism for the forward settlement of U.S.\nagency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS.\nMost transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur\nthrough the use of TBA transactions. TBA\ntransactions generally are conducted in\naccordance with widely-accepted guidelines\nwhich establish commonly observed terms and\nconditions for execution, settlement, and\ndelivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and\nseller decide on general trade parameters,\nsuch as the issuing agency, settlement date,\npar amount, and price. The actual mortgage\npools delivered generally are determined two\ndays prior to settlement date. Certain of the\nFunds may regularly enter into TBA agreements\nand \u201c roll over \u201d such agreements prior to the\nsettlement date stipulated in such agreements.\nThis type of TBA transaction is sometimes\nknown as a \u201c TBA roll. \u201d In a TBA roll, such\nFunds generally will sell the obligation to\npurchase the pools stipulated in the TBA\nagreement prior to the stipulated settlement\ndate and will enter into a new TBA agreement\nfor future delivery of pools of MBS. In\naddition, certain of the Funds may enter into\nTBA agreements and settle such transactions on\nthe stipulated settlement date by accepting\nactual receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS\nstipulated in the TBA agreement. Certain of\nthe Funds may invest cash pending settlement\nof TBA transactions in money market\ninstruments, repurchase agreements, or other\nhigh quality, liquid short-term instruments,\nincluding money market funds advised by BFA.\nEach such Fund will pay its pro rata share of\nfees and expenses of any money market fund\nthat it may invest in, in addition to such\nFund\u2019s own fees and expenses. Collateralized\nMortgage Obligations . U.S. agency MBS may\nalso be structured in the form of CMOs. CMOs\nare created by dividing the principal and\ninterest payments collected on a pool of\nmortgages into several revenue streams ( \u201c\ntranches \u201d ) with different priority rights to\nportions of the underlying mortgage payments.\nCertain CMO tranches may represent a right to\nreceive interest only, principal only, or an\namount that remains after floating-rate\ntranches are paid (an \u201c inverse floater \u201d ).\nThese securities are frequently referred to as\n\u201c mortgage derivatives \u201d and may be extremely\nsensitive to changes in interest rates.\nInterest rates on inverse floaters, for\nexample, vary inversely with a short-term\nfloating rate (which may be reset\nperiodically). Interest rates on inverse\nfloaters will decrease when short-term rates\nincrease and will increase when short-term\nrates decrease. These securities have the\neffect of providing a degree of investment\nleverage. In response to changes in market\ninterest rates or other market conditions, the\nvalue of an inverse floater may increase or\ndecrease at a multiple of the increase or\ndecrease in the value of the underlying\nsecurities. If a Fund invests in CMO tranches\nissued by U.S. government agencies or\nsponsored entities and interest rates move in\na manner not anticipated by BFA, it is\npossible that such a Fund could lose all or\nsubstantially all of its investment. Certain\nCMOs in which certain of the Funds may invest\nmay also provide a degree of investment\nleverage, which could cause such a Fund to\nlose all or substantially all of its\ninvestment. U.S. Government Obligations.\nCertain of the Funds may invest in various\ntypes of U.S. government obligations. U.S.\ngovernment obligations are a type of bond and\ninclude securities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of\nprincipal and interest on U.S. government\nobligations (i) may be backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be\nbacked solely by the issuing or guaranteeing\nagency or instrumentality itself (as with\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan\nBank notes). In the latter case, each Fund\nmust look principally to the agency or\ninstrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the\nobligation for ultimate repayment, which\nagency or instrumentality may be privately\nowned. There can be no assurance that the U.S.\ngovernment would provide financial support to\nits agencies or instrumentalities where it is\nnot obligated to do so. As a general matter,\nthe value of debt instruments, including U.S.\ngovernment obligations, declines when market\ninterest rates increase and rises when market\ninterest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S.\ngovernment obligations are subject to\nfluctuations in yield or value due to their\nstructure or contract terms. Some government\nagencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, purchase and guarantee residential\nmortgages and form MBS that they issue to the\nmarket. These agencies also hold their own MBS\nas well as those of other institutions with\nfunding from the agency debentures they issue.\nRecent events in the markets for MBS have\nadversely affected the value of those MBS held\nand/or issued by these agencies.\nU.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of\nNon-U.S. Issuers. The Funds (other than the\niShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF,\nMunicipal Bond Funds and Treasury Bond Funds)\nmay invest in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-\ndenominated bonds of non-U.S. governments,\nagencies, supranational entities and corporate\nissuers. The iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares BBB Rated Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\nBroad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares\nCore 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S.\nAggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\nESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF,\niShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year\n\n21\n\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S.\nAggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit\nBond ETF, iShares High Yield Systematic Bond\nETF, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate\nGovernment/Credit Bond ETF and iShares\nInvestment Grade Systematic Bond ETF may\ninvest in Restricted Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers. Investing in\nU.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds\nor Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers involves some risks and considerations\nnot typically associated with investing in\nU.S. issuers. These include differences in\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards; the possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries; and\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. In addition, the risk that the\nissuer may fail to meet its obligations on\nthese securities may be affected by\nfluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange\nrates between the issuer's local currency and\nthe U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Future Developments. The\nBoard may, in the future, authorize each Fund\nto invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided\nthey are consistent with each Fund's\ninvestment objective and do not violate any\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in each\nFund's Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of bonds in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Call Risk.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, an\nissuer of a callable bond held by certain\nFunds may \u201c call \u201d or repay the security\nbefore its stated maturity, and a Fund may\nhave to reinvest the proceeds in securities\nwith lower yields, which would result in a\ndecline in the Fund's income, or in securities\nwith greater risks or with other less\nfavorable features. Custody Risk. Custody risk\nrefers to the risks inherent in the process of\nclearing and settling trades and to the\nholding of securities, cash and other assets\nby local banks, agents and depositories. Low\ntrading volumes and volatile prices in less\ndeveloped markets make trades harder to\ncomplete and settle, and governments or trade\ngroups may compel local agents to hold\nsecurities in designated depositories that may\nnot be subject to independent evaluation.\nLocal agents are held only to the standards of\ncare of their local markets, and thus may be\nsubject to limited or no government oversight.\nCommunications between the U.S. and emerging\nmarket countries may be unreliable, increasing\nthe risk of delayed settlements or losses of\nsecurity certificates. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities market is,\nthe greater the likelihood of custody\nproblems. Practices in relation to the\nsettlement of securities transactions in\nemerging markets involve higher risks than\nthose in developed markets, in part because of\nthe use of brokers and counterparties that are\noften less well capitalized, and custody and\nregistration of assets in some countries may\nbe unreliable. The possibility of fraud,\nnegligence or undue influence being exerted by\nthe issuer or refusal to recognize ownership\nexists in some emerging markets, and, along\nwith other factors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, certain debt obligations may\nbe paid off substantially more slowly than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply, resulting in a\ndecline in a Fund\u2019s income and potentially in\nthe value of a Fund\u2019s investments.\n\n22\n\nIlliquid Investments Risk. Each Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Issuer Insolvency Risk.\nEach Fund's potential exposure to financially\nor operationally troubled issuers involves a\nhigh degree of credit and market risk, which\nmay be heightened during an economic downturn\nor recession. Should an issuer of securities\nheld by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy\nproceeding, reorganization or financial\nrestructuring, a wide variety of\nconsiderations make an evaluation of the\noutcome of a Fund\u2019s exposure to the issuer\nuncertain. During the period of a bankruptcy\nproceeding, reorganization or financial\nrestructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund\nwill receive any interest payments on the\nsecurities of the issuer. Each Fund will be\nsubject to significant uncertainty as to\nwhether the reorganization or restructuring\nwill be completed, and each Fund may bear\ncertain extraordinary expenses to protect and\nrecover its investment. Each Fund will also be\nsubject to significant uncertainty as to when\nand in what manner and for what value the\nobligations evidenced by the securities of the\nissuer held by a Fund will eventually be\nsatisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring is adopted with respect to the\nsecurities of the issuer held by each Fund,\nthere can be no assurance that the securities\nor other assets received by a Fund in\nconnection with such plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring will not have a lower value or\nincome potential than may have been\nanticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable\nto enforce its claims or rights in any\ncollateral or may have its claims or security\ninterest in any collateral challenged,\ndisallowed or subordinated to the claims or\nsecurity interests of other creditors. In\naddition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode or other relevant laws could alter the\nexpected outcome or introduce greater\nuncertainty regarding the outcome of each\nFund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a\nbankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or\nrestructuring, the securities of the issuer\nheld by a Fund could be re-characterized, or\neach Fund may receive different securities or\nother assets, including equity securities.\nThese types of equity securities include, but\nare not limited to: common stock; preferred\nstock (including convertible preferred stock);\nbonds, notes and debentures convertible into\ncommon or preferred stock; stock purchase\nwarrants and rights; equity interests in\ntrusts; and depositary receipts. Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their value may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. Holders of\nequity securities are subject to more risk\nthan holders of debt securities because the\nstatus of equity holders is subordinate to\ndebtholders in an issuer's capital structure.\nThe value of equity securities received by\neach Fund could decline if the financial\ncondition of the issuer deteriorates or if\noverall market and economic conditions, or\nconditions within the issuer\u2019s region or\nindustry, deteriorate. Equity securities\nreceived by a Fund through a bankruptcy\nproceeding, reorganization or restructuring of\nan issuer would not be component securities of\na Fund\u2019s Underlying Index, which could subject\na Fund to additional tracking error risk.\n\n23\n\nTo the extent that a Fund receives other\nassets in connection with a bankruptcy\nproceeding, reorganization or financial\nrestructuring, a Fund may also be subject to\nadditional risks associated with the assets\nreceived. One example of assets that a Fund\ncould receive is an interest in one or more\nloans made to the issuer as part of a workout\nagreed to by a consortium of lienholders and\ncreditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive\nsuch interests in loans to the extent\npermitted by the 1940 Act. Securities or other\nassets received in a reorganization or\nrestructuring typically entail a higher degree\nof risk than investments in securities of\nissuers that have not undergone a\nreorganization or restructuring and may be\nsubject to heavy selling or downward pricing\npressure after completion of the\nreorganization or restructuring. The post-\nreorganization/restructuring assets and\nsecurities may also be illiquid and difficult\nto sell or value. If a Fund participates in\nnegotiations with respect to a plan of\nreorganization or restructuring with respect\nto securities of the issuer held by a Fund,\neach Fund also may be restricted from\ndisposing such securities for a period of\ntime. If a Fund becomes involved in such\nproceedings, each Fund may have more active\nparticipation in the affairs of the issuer\nthan that assumed generally by an investor.\nMoney Market Instruments Risk. A Fund may hold\nmoney market instruments. The value of money\nmarket instruments may be affected by changes\nin interest rates or in the credit ratings of\nthe investments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nMunicipal Market Disruption Risk. The value of\nmunicipal securities may be affected by\nuncertainties in the municipal market related\nto legislation or litigation involving the\ntaxation of municipal securities or the rights\nof municipal securities holders in the event\nof a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or\neliminate the U.S. federal income tax\nexemption for interest on municipal securities\nare introduced before the U.S. Congress from\ntime to time. Proposals also may be introduced\nbefore state legislatures that would affect\nthe state tax treatment of a municipal fund\u2019s\ndistributions. If such proposals were enacted,\nthe availability of municipal securities and\nthe value of a Municipal Bond Fund\u2019s holdings\nwould be affected, and the Trustees would\nreevaluate the Fund\u2019s investment objective and\npolicies. Municipal bankruptcies are\nrelatively rare, and certain provisions of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such\nbankruptcies are unclear and remain untested.\nFurther, the application of state law to\nmunicipal issuers could produce varying\nresults among the states or among municipal\nsecurities issuers within a state. These legal\nuncertainties could affect the municipal\nsecurities market generally, certain specific\nsegments of the market, or the relative credit\nquality of particular securities. Any of these\neffects could have a significant impact on the\nprices of some or all of the municipal\nsecurities held by a Municipal Bond Fund.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Prepayment Risk. During\nperiods of falling interest rates, issuers of\ncertain debt obligations may repay principal\nprior to the security\u2019s maturity, which may\ncause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities\nwith lower yields or higher risk of default,\nresulting in a decline in the Fund\u2019s income or\nreturn potential. Also, if a security subject\nto prepayment had been purchased at a premium,\nthe value of the premium would be lost in the\nevent of prepayment. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S.\n\n24\n\nTreasury securities in the repurchase\nagreement market, has been used increasingly\non a voluntary basis in new instruments and\ntransactions. Under U.S. regulations that\nimplement a statutory fallback mechanism to\nreplace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR\nhave replaced LIBOR in different categories of\nfinancial contracts. Neither the effect of the\nLIBOR transition process nor its ultimate\nsuccess can yet be known. While some existing\nLIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a\nscenario where LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Repurchase Agreement Risk. A\nrepurchase agreement is an instrument under\nwhich the purchaser ( i.e. , a Fund) acquires\na security and the seller agrees, at the time\nof the sale, to repurchase the security at a\nmutually agreed upon time and price.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price. If the seller defaults\non its obligation under the agreement, a Fund\nmay suffer delays and incur costs or lose\nmoney in exercising its rights under the\nagreement. If the seller fails to repurchase\nthe security and the market value of the\nsecurity declines, a Fund may lose money. Risk\nof Derivatives. A derivative is a financial\ncontract, the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying\nasset, such as a security, a commodity (such\nas gold or silver), a currency or an index (a\nmeasure of value or rates, such as the S&P 500\nor the prime lending rate). Each Fund may\ninvest in variable rate demand notes and\nobligations, and tender option bonds, which\nmay be considered derivatives. Compared to\nsecurities, derivatives can be more sensitive\nto changes in interest rates or to sudden\nfluctuations in market prices and thus a\nFund's losses may be greater if it invests in\nderivatives than if it invests only in\nconventional securities. Derivatives are also\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill not fulfill its contractual obligations.\nDerivatives generally involve the incurrence\nof leverage. When a derivative is used as a\nhedge against a position that a Fund holds or\nis committed to purchase, any loss generated\nby the derivative generally should be\nsubstantially offset by gains on the hedged\ninvestment, and vice versa. While hedging can\nreduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce\nor eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand the Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nFutures and Options on Futures Transactions.\nThere are several risks accompanying the\nutilization of futures contracts and options\non futures contracts. A position in futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts may\nbe closed only on the exchange on which the\ncontract was made (or a linked exchange).\nWhile each Fund plans to utilize futures\ncontracts only if an active market exists for\nsuch contracts, there is no guarantee that a\nliquid market will exist for the contract at a\nspecified time. Furthermore, because, by\ndefinition, futures contracts project price\nlevels in the future and not current levels of\nvaluation, market circumstances may result in\na discrepancy between the price of the bond\nindex future and the movement in the relevant\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, a Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if a Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered bond index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. Each Fund, however, intends to\nutilize futures and options contracts in a\nmanner designed to limit its risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of bonds in which it invests.\n\n25\n\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss by a Fund of\nmargin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of\na broker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day's\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities.\nUncollateralized bonds issued by agencies,\nsubdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign\ngovernments are generally backed only by the\ncreditworthiness and reputation of the\nentities issuing the bonds and may not be\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nforeign government. Moreover, a foreign\ngovernment that explicitly provides its full\nfaith and credit to a particular entity may\nbe, due to changed circumstances, unable or\nunwilling to actually provide that support. If\na non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its\nobligations, the performance of a Fund will be\nadversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency\u2019s\noperations and financial condition are\ninfluenced by the foreign government\u2019s\neconomic and other policies. Changes to the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of a\nforeign government may cause the value of debt\nissued by that particular foreign government\u2019s\nagencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to\ndecline. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency\nbonds may be less liquid while market prices\nmay be more volatile than prices of U.S.\nagency bonds. Additional risks associated with\nnon-U.S. agency investing include differences\nin accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries and cause\nrestrictions on the flow of international\ncapital. Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt\nSecurities. Non-U.S. debt securities are\ntraded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the\nrespective countries covered by a Fund. The\nrisks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities\ntypically include market fluctuations caused\nby such factors as economic and political\ndevelopments, changes in interest rates and\nperceived trends in bond prices. Investing in\na fund whose portfolio contains securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the securities of U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include securities markets that\nmay lack sufficient liquidity or may be less\nefficient; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of a\nFund; higher transaction and custody costs;\ndelays and risks attendant in settlement\nprocedures; difficulties in enforcing\ncontractual obligations; lower liquidity and\nsignificantly smaller market capitalization of\nmost non-U.S. securities markets; different\naccounting and disclosure standards; lower\nlevels of regulation of the securities\nmarkets; more substantial government\ninterference with the economy; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand different bankruptcy and insolvency\nregimes which may stay or prevent recovery in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s default. Risk of Swap\nAgreements. The risk of loss with respect to\nswaps is generally limited to the net amount\nof payments that a Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations. If such a default\noccurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect such Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , a Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). A Fund is\nrequired to post and collect variation margin\nand initial margin (comprised of specified\nliquid securities subject to haircuts) in\nconnection with trading of OTC swaps. These\nrequirements may raise the costs for a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in swaps.\n\n26\n\nSecurities Lending Risk. A Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that a Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. A Fund could also lose money\nin the event of a decline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned securities or a\ndecline in the value of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These events could also\ntrigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.\nSpecial Considerations Regarding Investments\nin California Municipal Securities Following\nis a brief summary of some of the factors that\nmay affect the financial condition of the\nState of California (referred to herein as the\n\u201c State \u201d or \u201c California \u201d ) and its\npolitical subdivisions. The summary is neither\na complete nor a comprehensive description of\nthese factors nor an analysis of financial\nconditions and may not be indicative of the\nfinancial condition of issuers of obligations\nor any particular projects financed with the\nproceeds of such obligations. Many factors not\nincluded in the summary, such as any\ncontinuing economic and health-related impacts\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on the State, local\nand national economies and impacts on public\nagency funding needs, changes in federal\npolicies related to trade, health care and\nimmigration, social and environmental policies\nand conditions, the national and international\nmarkets for products produced in California,\ndevelopments in municipal bankruptcies and\nsignificant unfunded pension and other post-\nemployment benefit liabilities, could have an\nadverse impact on the financial condition of\nthe State and its political subdivisions. The\nFund is unable to predict whether or to what\nextent such factors or other factors may\naffect the issuers of the municipal\nsecurities, the market value or marketability\nof the municipal securities or the ability of\nthe respective issuers of the municipal\nsecurities acquired by the Fund to pay\ninterest on or principal of the municipal\nsecurities. The Fund invests a high proportion\nof its assets in California municipal\nsecurities. The payment of interest on and\npreservation of principal in these securities\nare dependent upon the continuing ability of\nCalifornia issuers and/or obligors of State,\nmunicipal and public authority debt\nobligations to meet their obligations\nthereunder. In addition to general economic\npressures, certain California constitutional\namendments, legislative measures, executive\norders, administrative regulations and voter\ninitiatives could adversely affect a\nCalifornia issuer\u2019s ability to raise revenues\nto meet its financial obligations. The\nfollowing summary is based upon the most\nrecent publicly available State budget\ndocuments, specifically, the 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget (the \u201c 2024-25 Governor\u2019s\nBudget \u201d ), which was released by the Governor\nof the State (the \u201c Governor \u201d ) on January\n10, 2024; the State Legislative Analyst\u2019s\nOffice ( \u201c LAO \u201d ) reports; as well as\noffering statements relating to public debt\nofferings of the State. This summary has not\nbeen updated nor will it be updated during the\nyear. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel\nhas independently verified this information.\nThe information provided below is intended\nonly as a general summary and is subject to\nchange rapidly, substantially, and without\nnotice, and the inclusion of such information\nherein shall not create any implication that\nthere has been no change in the affairs of the\nState or issuers therein since the date of its\npreparation. Certain statements included in\nthis summary constitute \u201c forward-looking\nstatements. \u201d Such statements are generally\nidentifiable by the terminology used such as \u201c\nplan, \u201d \u201c estimate, \u201d \u201c expect, \u201d \u201c budget \u201d\nor similar words. The achievement of certain\nresults or other expectations contained in\nsuch forward-looking statements involve known\nor unknown risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors that may cause actual results,\nperformance or achievements attained to be\nmaterially different from any future results,\nperformances or achievements expressed or\nimplied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview of Economic and Demographic Factors\nCalifornia is the most populous state in the\nnation; indeed, California is about 28% larger\nthan the second most-populous state.\nCalifornia\u2019s population was an estimated 39.1\nmillion as of July 2023, down 0.1% from the\nprevious year. In long-term projections,\nCalifornia\u2019s population growth has slowed and\nis projected to grow marginally from 39\nmillion in 2022 to 39.5 million by 2060. With\npopulation aging, deaths are expected to\nincrease more than births, lessening the\nState\u2019s population growth over time, but\nprojected gains from migration - in line with\nCalifornia\u2019s historical patterns - bolster\nyounger age groups in each projection year.\nCalifornia\u2019s economy, the largest among the 50\nstates, has major components in high\ntechnology, trade, entertainment,\nmanufacturing, government, tourism,\nconstruction and services. The relative\nproportion of the various components of the\nCalifornia economy closely resembles the make-\nup of the national economy. California\u2019s\neconomy accounted for nearly 15% of the U.S.\ngross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ) in calendar\nyear 2022. California remained the fifth\nlargest economy in the world in 2022, with a\nGDP of $3.6 trillion in current dollars.\n\n27\n\nCalifornia\u2019s labor force has yet to recover to\nits pre-pandemic level as of September 2023\nafter growing by 1.4 percent in 2022, a rate\nnot seen since the 2000s, and has since slowed\nto average growth of 0.8 percent year-over-\nyear through September 2023. California\u2019s\nunemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent in\n2022. The State\u2019s unemployment rate fell to\nits record low of 3.8 percent in July and\nAugust 2022 and had increased nearly 1\npercentage point to 4.7 percent in September\n2023. The State reported in April 2024 that\nthe State\u2019s unemployment rate is projected to\nincrease through early 2025 as current tight\nfinancial conditions soften the labor market.\nThe unemployment rate is projected to peak in\nearly 2025 at 5.2 percent before moderating to\n5 percent thereafter. The State reported in\nApril 2024 that California\u2019s median price for\nexisting single-family home sales reached a\nrecord high of $893,200 in May 2022. However,\nas interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage\nrates, the demand for housing in the second\nhalf of 2022 began to fall and the median sale\nprice for housing also fell. The November 2023\nmedian sale price of $822,200 was 7.9% below\nthe May 2022 peak. According to preliminary\nfigures, California residential housing units\nauthorized by building permits was\napproximately 111,221 in 2023, a 7% decline\ncompared to 2022. Multi-family units were down\nby 4.8% in 2023 relative to 2022, and single-\nfamily units were down by 9.0%. California\u2019s\nhigh cost of living, primarily driven by high\nhousing costs, remains an ongoing public\npolicy challenge. Overview of State Finances\nState Budget Process . The State\u2019s fiscal year\nbegins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the\nfollowing year. The annual State budget is\nproposed by the Governor by January 10 of each\nyear for the next fiscal year (the \u201c\nGovernor\u2019s Budget \u201d ). The Governor released\nhis initial budget proposal for fiscal year\n2024-25 on January 10, 2024 (previously\ndefined as the \u201c 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget \u201d\n). State law also requires the Governor to\nupdate the Governor\u2019s Budget projections and\nbudgetary proposals by May 14 of each year\n(the \u201c May Revision \u201d ). The Governor is\nrequired to sign the budget by the start of\nthe fiscal year on July 1. The Governor signed\nthe fiscal year 2023-24 budget (the \u201c 2023-24\nBudget \u201d ) on June 27, 2023. The LAO releases\nanalysis of the Governor\u2019s various budget\nproposals throughout the year. 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget, Revenue Forecasts . The\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget, released on January\n10, 2024, comes in a period marked by recent\nrevenue shortfalls due largely to the\nvolatility of the State\u2019s tax base. Personal\nincome, sales, and corporation taxes have\nhistorically constituted the largest share of\nState Treasury General Fund (the \u201c General\nFund \u201d ) revenues and transfers. The personal\nincome tax is the State\u2019s largest revenue\nsource and is projected to comprise 53.5% of\nall General Fund revenues and transfers in\nfiscal year 2024-25. These three revenue\nsources combined were projected to constitute\napproximately 87.8% of General Fund revenues\nand transfers in fiscal year 2024-25. As\ndescribed herein, the State has a very\nprogressive income tax structure with the top\none percent of taxpayers generally paying more\nthan 40% of all personal income tax. This\nreliance on a progressive income tax structure\nhas resulted in more volatility in the State\u2019s\nrevenue base. The table below shows General\nFund revenues and transfers for fiscal years\n2020-21 through 2024-25 (including percentage\nof total State revenues and transfers).\n                                              \n                   Sa\u2026               Ot\u2026      \n  F\u2026      Pe\u2026        &      Co\u2026      Re\u2026  T\u2026  \n  Y\u2026      Tax      Use      Tax      Tr\u2026      \n                   Tax                        \n  2\u2026  $\u2026  66\u2026  $\u2026  14\u2026  $\u2026  11\u2026  $\u2026  7.\u2026  $\u2026  \n  2\u2026  1\u2026  59\u2026  3\u2026  14\u2026  4\u2026  19\u2026  1\u2026  7.4  2\u2026  \n  2\u2026  1\u2026  56\u2026  3\u2026  18\u2026  3\u2026  20\u2026  8\u2026  4.6  1\u2026  \n  2\u2026  1\u2026  57\u2026  3\u2026  17\u2026  3\u2026  18\u2026  1\u2026  5.9  1\u2026  \n  2\u2026  1\u2026  53\u2026  3\u2026  16\u2026  3\u2026  17\u2026  2\u2026  12\u2026  2\u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Projected. The 25% decline in personal\nincome tax revenue and 18% decline in\ncorporate income tax revenue between fiscal\nyear 2021-22 and fiscal year 2022-23 was not\nanticipated at the time of the development of\nthe 2023-24 Budget. The State attributes its\nforecasting errors in part due to delayed tax\nfilings following widespread winter storm\ndisaster declarations. These delayed filings\nleft the State without critical cash data\ntypically used for forecasting until later in\nthe fiscal year. Mid-year budgetary\n\n28\n\nactions have not fully mitigated the\nshortfalls. As a result of the revenue\nshortfalls, the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget\nfaces comparatively larger challenges. The\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget estimated a budget\nproblem (when resources for the upcoming\nbudget are insufficient to cover the costs of\ncurrently authorized services, also known as a\ndeficit) of $38 billion and forecasts future-\nyear deficits of $37 billion in 2025-26, $30\nbillion in 2026-27, and $28 billion in\n2027-28. The LAO projected higher deficits\nwhen it initially reported on the 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget in January 2024, with the\nLAO estimating a $58 billion deficit for\nfiscal year 2024-25, contrasted to the\nGovernor\u2019s estimate of $38 billion. In a more\nrecent February 2024 report, the LAO projects\neven further weakness relative to those\nestimates. Specifically, the LAO\u2019s revised\nrevenue forecast is about $24 billion below\nthe 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget. Roughly, a $24\nbillion erosion in revenues corresponds to a\n$15 billion increase in the budget problem.\nThis would expand the LAO\u2019s $58 billion\nestimated deficit for fiscal year 2024-25 to\n$73 billion under its updated revenue\nforecast. The urgency to address the deficit\nprompted Governor Newsom\u2019s call for early\naction, urging legislative intervention ahead\nof the June 15 budget deadline. Constitutional\nLimitations on Taxes, Other Charges,\nAppropriations and General Fund Revenues Over\nthe years, a number of constitutional\namendments have been enacted, often through\nvoter initiatives, that have increased the\ndifficulty of raising State taxes or\nrestricted the use of General Fund revenues.\nSome of the most significant of these approved\nconstitutional amendments are described below.\nBecause of the complex nature of these\ninitiatives and the ambiguities and possible\ninconsistencies in their terms, it is not\npossible to predict with certainty the impact\non California debt obligations or on the\nability of the State or local governments to\npay debt service on such California debt\nobligations. Further initiatives or\nlegislative changes in laws or the California\nConstitution may also affect the ability of\nthe State or local governments to repay their\nobligations. Limitation on Property Taxes.\nCertain California debt obligations may be\nobligations of local government issuers that\nrely in whole or in part, directly or\nindirectly, on ad valorem property taxes as a\nsource of revenue. The taxing powers of\nCalifornia local governments are limited by\nArticle XIIIA of the California Constitution (\n\u201c Article XIIIA \u201d ), enacted by the voters in\n1978 and commonly known as \u201c Proposition 13. \u201d\nBriefly, Article XIIIA limits the rate of ad\nvalorem property taxes to 1% of the full cash\nvalue of real property and generally restricts\nthe reassessment of property to 2% per year,\nexcept upon new construction or change of\nownership (subject to a number of exemptions).\nLocal government taxing entities, however, may\nraise ad valorem taxes above the 1% limit to\npay debt service on voter-approved bonded\nindebtedness. See \u201c Obligations of Other\nIssuers \u201d herein. Under Article XIIIA, the\nbasic 1% ad valorem tax levy is applied\nagainst the assessed value of property as of\nthe owner\u2019s date of acquisition (or as of\nMarch 1, 1975, if acquired earlier), subject\nto certain adjustments. This system has\nresulted in widely varying amounts of tax on\nsimilarly situated properties. Several\nlawsuits were filed challenging the\nacquisition-based assessment system of\nProposition 13, but it was upheld by the U.S.\nSupreme Court in 1992. For further discussion\non Proposition 13, see \u201c Local Governments \u2014\nConstitutional and Statutory Limitations on\nLocal Government \u201d below. For further\ndiscussion on voter approval requirements\nunder Article XIIIA, see \u201c \u2014 Voter\nRequirements for Taxes and Fees \u201d below.\nLimitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges.\nIn 1996, the voters of the State approved\nProposition 218, called the \u201c Right to Vote on\nTaxes Act. \u201d Proposition 218 added Article\nXIIIC ( \u201c Article XIIIC \u201d ) and Article XIIID\n( \u201c Article XIIID \u201d ) to the State\nConstitution, each of which contains a number\nof provisions affecting the ability of local\ngovernments to levy and collect both existing\nand future taxes, assessments, fees and\ncharges. Article XIIIC requires that all new\nor increased local taxes be submitted to the\nvoters before they become effective.\nProposition 26, discussed below under the\ncaption entitled \u201c \u2014 Voter Requirements for\nTaxes and Fees, \u201d amended Article XIIIC by\nadding an expansive definition of \u201c taxes \u201d to\ninclude many regulatory fees currently imposed\nby the State and its municipalities. Taxes for\ngeneral governmental purposes require a\nmajority vote and taxes for specific purposes\nrequire a two-thirds vote. Article XIIID\ncontains several provisions making it\ngenerally more difficult for local governments\nto levy and maintain \u201c assessments \u201d for\nmunicipal services and programs. Article XIIID\nalso contains several provisions affecting \u201c\nfees \u201d and\n\n29\n\n\u201c charges, \u201d defined for purposes of Article\nXIIID to mean \u201c any levy other than an ad\nvalorem tax, a special tax, or an assessment,\nimposed by a local government upon a parcel or\nupon a person as an incident of property\nownership, including a user fee or charge for\na property related service. \u201d All new and\nexisting property-related fees and charges\nmust conform to requirements prohibiting,\namong other things, fees and charges that\ngenerate revenues exceeding the funds that are\nrequired to provide the property-related\nservice or are used for unrelated purposes.\nArticle XIIID imposes notice, hearing and\nprotest procedures for levying or increasing\nproperty-related fees and charges, and, except\nfor fees or charges for sewer, water and\nrefuse collection services (or fees for\nelectrical and gas service, which are not\ntreated as \u201c property related \u201d for purposes\nof Article XIIID), no property-related fee or\ncharge may be imposed or increased without\nmajority approval by the property owners\nsubject to the fee or charge or, at the option\nof the local government, two-thirds voter\napproval by the electorate residing in the\naffected area. In addition to the provisions\ndescribed above, Article XIIIC removes\nlimitations on the initiative power in matters\nof local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.\nConsequently, local voters, by future\ninitiative, could repeal, reduce or prohibit\nthe future imposition or increase of any local\ntax, assessment, fee or charge. It is unclear\nhow this right of local initiative may be used\nin cases where taxes or charges have been or\nwill be specifically pledged to secure debt\nissues. Limitations on the State\u2019s Ability to\nTransfer Funds from Local Governments. In\n2010, voters in the State approved Proposition\n22, a constitutional initiative. Proposition\n22, known as the \u201c Local Taxpayer, Public\nSafety, and Transportation Protection Act of\n2010, \u201d eliminated or reduced the State\u2019s\nauthority to (i) temporarily shift property\ntaxes from cities, counties and special\ndistricts to schools, (ii) use vehicle license\nfee revenues to reimburse local governments\nfor State-mandated costs (i.e., the State will\nhave to use other revenues to reimburse local\ngovernments), (iii) redirect property tax\nincrement from redevelopment agencies (which\nhave since been dissolved, see \u201c Obligations\nof Other Issuers \u2014 Tax Increment and the\nDissolution of Redevelopment Agencies \u201d below)\nto any other local government, (iv) use State\nfuel tax revenues to pay debt service on State\ntransportation bonds, or (v) borrow or change\nthe distribution of State fuel tax revenues.\nVoter Requirements for Taxes and Fees.\nProposition 26, known as the \u201c Supermajority\nVote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act \u201d was\napproved by State voters in 2010. Proposition\n26 amended provisions of Article XIIIA and\nArticle XIIIC governing the imposition of\ntaxes. Proposition 26 requires a two-thirds\nsupermajority vote in the California State\nLegislature (the \u201c State Legislature \u201d ) prior\nto the imposition of any change in State\nstatute that results in any taxpayer paying a\nhigher tax. This requirement eliminated the\nprior practice that allowed, via majority\nvote, one tax to be increased if another tax\nis lowered by an equivalent amount.\nFurthermore, any increase in a fee beyond the\namount needed to provide the specific service\nor benefit is deemed a \u201c tax \u201d and thus would\nrequire two-thirds vote of any governmental\nunits for passage. As noted, Proposition 26\nrequires taxes for general governmental\npurposes to be approved by a majority vote and\ntaxes for specific purposes to be approved by\na two-thirds vote. Proposition 26 applied\nretroactively to any measures passed on or\nafter January 1, 2010. Appropriations Limits.\nThe State and its local governments are\nsubject to an annual \u201c appropriations limit \u201d\nimposed by Article XIIIB of the California\nConstitution ( \u201c Article XIIIB \u201d ), enacted by\nthe voters in 1979 and significantly amended\nby Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988 and 1990,\nrespectively. Article XIIIB prohibits the\nState or any covered local government from\nspending \u201c appropriations subject to\nlimitation \u201d in excess of the appropriations\nlimit imposed. \u201c Appropriations subject to\nlimitation \u201d are authorizations to spend \u201c\nproceeds of taxes, \u201d which consist of tax\nrevenues and certain other funds, including\nproceeds from regulatory licenses, user\ncharges or other fees, to the extent that such\nproceeds exceed the cost of providing the\nproduct or service, but \u201c proceeds of taxes \u201d\nexclude most State subventions to local\ngovernments. No limit is imposed on\nappropriations of funds that are not \u201c\nproceeds of taxes, \u201d such as reasonable user\ncharges or fees and certain other non-tax\nfunds, including bond proceeds. Among the\nexpenditures not included in the Article XIIIB\nappropriations limit are (i) the debt service\ncost of bonds issued or authorized prior to\nJanuary 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by\nthe voters, (ii) appropriations to comply with\nmandates of courts or the federal government,\n(iii) appropriations for certain capital\noutlay projects, (iv) appropriations for tax\nrefunds, (v) appropriations by the State of\npost-1989 increases in gasoline taxes and\nvehicle weight fees, (vi) appropriation of\ncertain special taxes imposed by initiative\n(e.g., cigarette and tobacco taxes) and (vii)\nappropriations made in certain cases of\nemergency. The appropriations limit for each\nyear is adjusted annually to reflect changes\nin cost of living and population and any\ntransfers of service responsibilities between\ngovernment units. \u201c Excess \u201d revenues are\nmeasured over a two-year cycle. Local\n\n30\n\ngovernments must return any excess to\ntaxpayers by rate reductions. The State must\nrefund 50% of any excess to taxpayers, with\nthe other 50% paid to schools and community\ncolleges. With more liberal annual adjustment\nfactors since 1988, few local governments have\nbeen operating near their spending limits, but\nthis condition may change over time. Local\ngovernments may by majority voter approval\nexceed their spending limits for up to four\nyears. The State has rarely exceeded its\nappropriations limit. In recent years,\nhowever, State appropriations have trended\ncloser to the limit. Strong revenue growth,\ncoupled with more moderate growth in the\nappropriations limit, served to reduce the\nroom under the limit. Two of the three growth\nfactors, the change in civilian population and\nthe change in K-14 average daily attendance,\nhave dropped to less than 1% and have been\nnegative, respectively, in a number of recent\nyears. The 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget estimates\nthat the State will remain under the limit\nthrough fiscal year 2024-25. Dedication of\nGeneral Fund Revenues to Schools. The single\nlargest portion of the State budget is support\nfor K-14 schools. In 1988, the voters of the\nState approved Proposition 98, a combined\ninitiative constitutional amendment and\nstatute, which (subject to suspension by a\ntwo-thirds vote of the State Legislature and\nthe Governor) guarantees local school\ndistricts and community college districts a\nminimum share of General Fund revenues (the \u201c\nProposition 98 Guarantee \u201d ) with the balance\nof school funding provided by a share of local\nproperty taxes. Proposition 98 is extremely\ncomplex and results in significant fiscal\nproblems when General Fund revenues fall short\nof the projections on which the original\nappropriations to schools were made. For\nfurther discussion regarding Proposition 98,\nsee \u201c Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding \u201d below.\nFuture initiatives . Voters, by future\ninitiatives, could make it more difficult for\nthe State or local governments to raise taxes,\nrestrict the use of general funds or special\nfund revenues, or limit legislative discretion\nin enacting budget. For example, the Taxpayers\nProtection and Government Accountability Act,\na constitutional amendment proposed by voter\ninitiative, has qualified for the November\n2024 statewide ballot and, if approved by\nvoters, would further limit the ability of\nvoters and state and local governments to\nraise revenues by imposing additional voter\napproval requirements. Obligations of the\nState The State has always paid when due the\nprincipal of and interest on its general\nobligation bonds, general obligation\ncommercial paper notes, lease revenue\nobligations and short-term obligations,\nincluding revenue anticipation notes and\nrevenue anticipation warrants. The State\nConstitution prohibits the creation of general\nobligation indebtedness of the State unless a\nbond measure is approved by a majority of the\nelectorate voting at a general election or a\ndirect primary. Capital Facilities Financing.\nThe State builds and acquires capital\nfacilities primarily through the use of\ngeneral obligation bonds and lease-purchase\nborrowing. Under the State Constitution, debt\nservice on outstanding general obligation\nbonds is the second charge to the General Fund\nafter support of the public school system and\npublic institutions of higher education. New\ngeneral obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds\nand other General Fund-supported debt are\nauthorized by the voters and/or the State\nLegislature with lease revenue bonds generally\nauthorized by the State Legislature. As of\nMarch 1, 2024, the State had approximately\n$71.1 billion of outstanding general\nobligation bonds and commercial paper payable\nprincipally from the State\u2019s General Fund and\napproximately $22.4 billion of authorized and\nunissued General Fund-supported general\nobligation bonds. As of March 1, 2024, the\nState had approximately $7.7 billion in\noutstanding lease revenue bonds payable from\nlease payments paid from the operating budget\nof the respective lessees, the operating\nbudgets of which are primarily, but not\nexclusively, derived from the General Fund. As\nof July 1, 2024, the State had $6.5 billion of\nauthorized but unissued lease revenue bonds.\nAs of April 2024, debt service on General\nFund-supported general obligation bonds and\nlease revenue debt was projected to equal\napproximately 3.95% of General Fund revenues\nin fiscal year 2023-24 and 4.02% of General\nFund revenues in fiscal year 2024-25. This\ndebt service cost is calculated based on the\namount of debt service to be paid without\nadjusting for reimbursement from various\nspecial funds and subsidy payments from the\nfederal government for taxable \u201c Build America\nBonds. \u201d Including those projected offsets\nwould reduce debt service on General Fund-\nsupported general obligation bonds and lease\nrevenue debt to approximately 3.07% of General\nFund revenues in fiscal year 2023-24 and 3.14%\nin fiscal year 2024-25. The actual General\nFund debt ratio in future fiscal years will\ndepend on a variety of factors, including\nactual debt issuance (which may include\nadditional issuance approved in the future by\nthe State Legislature and, for general\nobligation bonds, the voters), actual interest\nrates, debt service structure, and actual\nGeneral Fund revenues and transfers. Future\nBond Issuance Plans. The amount of outstanding\nGeneral Fund-supported debt, primarily general\nobligation bonds, may increase in coming years\ngiven the amount of authorized and unissued\nGeneral Fund-supported bonds the State can\nissue. See \u201c \u2014 Capital Facilities Financing \u201d\nabove. Based on estimates from the Department\nof Finance in April 2024,\n\n31\n\napproximately $5.1 billion and $3.5 billion of\nnew money general obligation bonds (some of\nwhich may initially be in the form of\ncommercial paper notes) and approximately $1.4\nbillion and $2.2 billion in lease revenue\nbonds are expected to be issued in fiscal year\n2023-24 and fiscal year 2024-25, respectively.\nHowever, the exact amount that may be issued\nwill depend on overall budget constraints,\nmarket conditions and other factors including\nupdated information provided to the Department\nof Finance by other departments in the State\nregarding funding needs and actual spending.\nThe State also issues refunding bonds as\nmarket conditions warrant. Cash Management. As\npart of its cash management program, prior to\nfiscal year 2015-16, the State has regularly\nissued short-term obligations to meet cash\nflow needs. External borrowings were typically\ndone with revenue anticipation notes that are\npayable later in the fiscal year in which they\nare issued. In April 2024, the State observed\nthat, based on then current cash projections,\nthe State is not expected to issue revenue\nanticipation notes through fiscal year\n2024-25. In April 2024, the State projected a\ndaily cash cushion of unused internal\nborrowable resources of at least $26 billion\nthrough the end of fiscal year 2024-25. The\nState is also authorized under certain\ncircumstances to issue revenue anticipation\nwarrants that are payable in the succeeding\nfiscal year, as well as registered refunding\nwarrants issued to refund revenue anticipation\nwarrants. The State has issued revenue\nanticipation warrants to bridge short-term\ncash flow shortages in five years since 1992.\nFrom time to time, the State Legislature has\ndeferred various payments due under State\nstatute in order to more closely align the\nState\u2019s revenues with its expenditures. This\ntechnique has been used in past budgets in\norder to reduce the State\u2019s need for external\nborrowing to bridge any cash flow deficit.\nFurther, State law gives the State Controller\nsome flexibility to delay payments to various\npayees, including State vendors, when the\nState Controller foresees a relatively short-\nterm cash flow shortage. In addition, the\nState issued IOUs in lieu of cash payments in\nJuly and August 2009, the second such issuance\nsince the 1930s. Obligations of State Agencies\nA number of State agencies and authorities\nissue obligations secured or payable from\nspecified revenue streams. These obligations\nare not payable from the General Fund and\ncarry different ratings than the State\u2019s\ngeneral obligation bonds. None of these\nrevenue bonds are backed by the State\u2019s faith\nand credit or taxing power. The Regents of the\nUniversity of California has been one of the\nlargest issuers of revenue bonds in recent\nyears. Other State agencies and authorities\nwith significant bond programs include the\nCalifornia State University system, with\nrevenue bonds secured by certain revenues of\nthe California State University; the State\nDepartment of Water Resources, with revenue\nbonds secured by power and water users; the\nCalifornia Health Facilities Financing\nAuthority, revenue bonds secured primarily by\nrevenues of various health facilities; and the\nCalifornia Education Facilities Authority,\nwith revenue bonds secured primarily by\nrevenues of various educational facilities.\nRecent Financial Results Historically, the\nprincipal sources of General Fund revenues are\npersonal income tax, sales and use tax and\ncorporation tax. The State\u2019s personal income\ntax structure is highly progressive, with\nrates ranging from 1% to 12.3%. For example,\nfor the 2020 tax year, the State reported that\nthe top one percent of income earners paid\nover 49% of personal income taxes. This\npercentage has been greater than 40% in every\nyear since 2004, except for 2009. The personal\nincome tax was made even more progressive with\nthe passage of Proposition 30 (defined below),\nwhich imposed additional taxes on earnings\nover $250,000, resulting in an income tax rate\nof 12.3% on earnings over $1 million. In\nNovember 2016, the voters in the State\napproved an extension of this portion of\nProposition 30 through the end of calendar\nyear 2030. A large portion of personal income\ntax receipts is derived from capital gains\nrealizations and stock option income. These\nrevenue sources can be particularly volatile.\nFor example, during the Great Recession\n(lasting from late-2007 to mid-2009), capital\ngains tax receipts dropped from nearly $9\nbillion in fiscal year 2007-08 to just under\n$3 billion in fiscal year 2009-10, a 67%\ndecline. California does not have a lower rate\nfor capital gains. All capital gains are taxed\nas ordinary income. As of April 2024, the\nState projected that capital gains would\naccount for 8.2% of General Fund tax revenues\nand transfers in fiscal year 2023-24 and 8.2%\nin fiscal year 2024-2025. The treatment of\ncapital gains, as well as the progressive\nnature of the personal income tax provides an\nincentive for some wealthy individuals to\nrelocate from the State. The State is required\nto maintain the Special Fund for Economic\nUncertainties ( \u201c SFEU \u201d ), derived from\nGeneral Fund revenues, as a reserve to meet\ncash needs of the General Fund, but the SFEU\nis required to be replenished as soon as\nsufficient revenues are available. Year-end\nbalances in the SFEU are included for\nfinancial reporting purposes in the General\nFund balance. The 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget\nprojected a balance in the SFEU of $3.4\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2024-25.\n\n32\n\nHowever, the amount in the SFEU at the end of\nany particular fiscal year may differ\nmaterially from the amount projected at the\ntime the related Budget for that fiscal year\nwas adopted. Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding\nThroughout the 1980s, State spending increased\nrapidly as the State population and economy\nalso grew rapidly. Such spending included\nincreased spending for many assistance\nprograms to local governments, which were\nconstrained by Proposition 13 and other laws.\nThe largest State assistance program is to\nlocal public school districts. In 1988, the\nvoters of the State approved Proposition 98, a\ncombined initiative constitutional amendment\nand statute, which provides for the\nProposition 98 Guarantee. The Proposition 98\nGuarantee is calculated each fiscal year using\none of three tests that apply under varying\nfiscal and economic conditions. Test 1\nearmarks a minimum portion of State revenue\nfor K-14 education, and Test 2 and Test 3 are\nbased on prior-year Proposition 98 funding\nadjusted for key factors including changes in\nstudent enrollment, as measured by K-12\naverage daily attendance. Test 2 further\nadjusts for the change in inflation. The test\nthat provides the highest level of funding\napplies. Test 2 and Test 3 are generally used\nin times of economic distress although the\nState also has the ability to suspend the\nProposition 98 funding mechanism. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget reflects the Proposition 98\nGuarantee of $109.1 billion for fiscal year\n2024-25. These revised Proposition 98\nGuarantee levels represent a decrease of\napproximately $11.3 billion over the three-\nyear period 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25\nrelative to the 2023-24 Budget. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget proposes statutory changes\nto address roughly $8 billion of this decrease\nto avoid impacting existing local educational\nagency and community college district budgets.\nFor further information on the limitations on\nGeneral Fund revenues imposed by Proposition\n98, see \u201c Constitutional Limitations on Taxes,\nOther Charges, Appropriations and General Fund\nRevenues \u2014 Dedication of General Fund Revenues\nto Schools \u201d above. State and Local Pension\nand Post-Retirement Liabilities State. The\nfinancial condition of the State and its\nlocalities is also subject to pension and\nother post-retirement benefit risks. Pension .\nThe pension funds managed by the State\u2019s\nretirement systems, the California Public\nEmployees\u2019 Retirement System ( \u201c CalPERS \u201d )\nand the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement\nSystem ( \u201c CalSTRS \u201d ), each have unfunded\nliabilities in the tens of billions of\ndollars. These unfunded liabilities will\nrequire increased contributions from the\nGeneral Fund in future years. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget included a $3.5 billion\nGeneral Fund contribution for the statutorily\nrequired annual State contribution to CalPERS\nfor State pension costs. This is $1.2 billion\nlower than the 2023-24 Budget General Fund\ncontribution due to the application of prior\nProposition 2 debt repayment funding paid to\nCalPERS. Included in these costs are $615.1\nmillion General Fund for California State\nUniversity retirement costs. Additionally, the\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget includes $885\nmillion one-time Proposition 2 debt repayment\nfunding as a supplemental payment toward the\nstate plans\u2019 unfunded liabilities. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget includes a $4.2 billion\nGeneral Fund contribution to CalSTRS. The\nroughly $302 million increase from the 2023-24\nBudget is due to higher-than-anticipated\ngrowth in creditable compensation from 2021-22\nto 2022-23. See also \u201c The State Budget \u2014\nBalanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and\nProposition 2) \u201d below. Since 2011, CalPERS\nand CalSTRS have incrementally reduced the\nassumed rate of return used to calculate their\nrespective unfunded liabilities, from 7.75%\n(for both funds) to 6.8% for CalPERS and 7.0%\nfor CalSTRS since November 2021. These\nassumption changes have resulted in\nsignificant increases in unfunded liability\nand have increased required state and other\nemployer contributions to these pension\nprograms. CalPERS and CalSTRS generally report\ntheir investment returns for the prior fiscal\nyear (ending June 30) in July of each year.\nThe most recent reported investment results\nfor both CalPERS and CalSTRS (based on market\nvalue) are set forth below.\n                                              \n               CalPERS Return on Investments  \n               for Fiscal Years 2018 through  \n               2022                           \n  Fiscal Year  Return onInvestments           \n  2017-18      8.6%                           \n  2018-19      6.7%                           \n  2019-20      4.7%                           \n                                              \n33\n                                              \n               CalPERS Return on Investments  \n               for Fiscal Years 2018 through  \n               2022                           \n  Fiscal Year  Return onInvestments           \n  2020-21      21.3%                          \n  2021-22      -6.1%                          \n  2022-23      5.8%(1)                        \n                                              \n(1) Preliminary; reported as of July 2023.\n                                              \n               CalSTRS Return on Investments  \n               for Fiscal Years 2018 through  \n               2022                           \n  Fiscal Year  Return onInvestments           \n  2017-18      9.0%                           \n  2018-19      6.8%                           \n  2019-20      3.9%                           \n  2020-21      27.2%                          \n  2021-22      -1.3%                          \n  2022-23      6.3%(1)                        \n                                              \n(1) Preliminary; reported as of July 2023.\nActual investment returns lower than the\nactuarially assumed level will result in\ndecreased funding status and increased\nactuarially required contribution. CalPERS\nestimated 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time\nweighted average returns of 6.1, 7.1 and 7.0%,\nrespectively as of June 30, 2023. As of June\n30, 2023, CalSTRS reported 5-year, 10-year and\n20-year time weighted average returns of 8.2,\n8.7 and 8.0%, respectively. The CalPERS Board\nreported an unfunded accrued liability\nallocable to State employees (excluding judges\nand elected officials), as of June 30, 2022,\nof $70.8 billion on a market value of assets (\n\u201c MVA \u201d ) basis. CalPERS no longer measures on\nan actuarial value of assets basis. As of June\n30, 2022, this represented a funded ratio of\n70.3%. The CalPERS Annual Comprehensive\nFinancial Report as of June 30, 2022 estimates\nthe funded ratio at 72%. Based on CalPERS July\n19, 2023 announcement on its preliminary\nreturns for fiscal year 2022-23, the funded\nratio was estimated at 72% as of June 30,\n2023. OPEB . The State also provides other\npost-employment health care and dental\nbenefits to its employees and certain of their\nspouses and dependents (hereinafter referred\nto as \u201c OPEB \u201d ), which benefits utilize a \u201c\npay-as-you-go \u201d funding policy. As of April\n2024, General Fund contributions to OPEB were\nestimated to be approximately $3.2 billion (or\n1.4% of total General Fund expenditures) for\nfiscal year 2023-24 and estimated at\napproximately $3.6 billion (or 1.7% of total\nGeneral Fund expenditures) for fiscal year\n2024-25. Government Accounting Standards Board\n( \u201c GASB \u201d ) Statements 74 and 75, each of\nwhich affects OPEB financial reporting, were\nissued in June 2015. As a result, there is an\nincreased focus on OPEB liability as GASB\nStatement No. 74 became effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after June 15, 2016, and GASB\nStatement No. 75 became effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after June 15, 2017. The\nState\u2019s most recent OPEB actuarial accrued\nliability report estimated approximately $87.5\nbillion of total OPEB actuarial accrued\nliability as of June 30, 2022 (of which\napproximately $82.4 billion is unfunded). As\nreported in April 2024, the State has set\naside funds in a prefunding trust fund to pay\nfor future retiree health benefits, and, by\nthe end of fiscal year 2023-24, the trust fund\nbalance is projected to exceed $8.5 billion in\nassets. Local. Many local governments in the\nState, many of which are current members of\nCalPERS, face similar and, in many cases, more\nsevere issues relating to unfunded pension and\nOPEB liabilities. The credit ratings, and even\nthe solvency, of these local governments may\nbe at risk in the future if these liabilities\nare not appropriately addressed through wage\nconcessions and restructuring of benefits.\nCities are particularly at risk because one of\ntheir primary missions is safety, and safety\npersonnel labor and retirement benefit costs\nare significantly greater than labor and\nretirement costs of general municipal\nemployees. Three cities \u2013 Vallejo, Stockton\nand San Bernardino \u2013 entered bankruptcy under\nChapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy code,\nlargely as a result of escalating labor costs\nand unfunded pension and other post-retirement\nliabilities. All three of these cities\n\n34\n\nhave agreements with CalPERS to administer\ntheir pension obligations, and their\nrespective obligations to CalPERS were a\nsignificant reason for their insolvency. Other\ncities (including some that contract with\nCalPERS) and counties have expressed public\nconcerns about their ability to meet their\nunfunded pension and other post-retirement\nliabilities, and a willingness to entertain\nbankruptcy as an option to resolve their\nfiscal problems. One federal bankruptcy judge\nstated that obligations to CalPERS could be\nadjusted in federal bankruptcy proceedings;\nhowever, the plan of adjustment in those\nproceedings was confirmed without reducing\nsuch obligations to CalPERS. Any definitive\nruling that allowed obligations to CalPERS to\nbe adjusted downward might encourage other\nfinancially stressed municipalities to explore\na Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The fiscal stress and\ncash pressures facing the State\u2019s localities\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be\nexacerbated as a result of the pandemic for\ncertain local governments depending on the\nmakeup of their economy or revenue sources as\nwell as the overall makeup of their\noutstanding debt. See \u201c Obligations of Other\nIssuers. \u201d School districts in the State are\nrequired to make contributions to CalSTRS for\ntheir teachers and staff. Changes in State law\nin 2014 increased statutorily required\ncontributions to CalSTRS from the State,\nschool districts, and teachers in order to\neliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded\nliability by 2045-46. General. The State and\nits localities that participate in pension and\nother post-employment benefit programs could\nface increasing contribution rates if related\npension or OPEB investment funds experience\ndeclining rates of return, plan assumptions\nchange or actual experience departs from\nassumptions. Future increases in pension fund\nand post-retirement benefit contributions\ncould reduce discretionary funds available for\nother governmental programs. In addition, the\ncredit ratings of the State or locality may be\nadversely affected if the State or locality\ndoes not reduce or manage its unfunded\nliabilities. See \u201c Bond Ratings \u201d below. State\nLaw Regarding Pensions and Pension Reform.\nCalifornia courts have been largely supportive\nof the vested or earned pension rights of\nState and local employees. Thus, pension\nreform efforts have been focused largely on\nlimitations on future benefits for new\nemployees, bringing limited, if any, immediate\nfinancial relief. In September 2012, the\nGovernor signed into law a comprehensive\npension reform package affecting State and\nlocal governments known as the California\nPublic Employees\u2019 Pension Reform Act of 2013 (\n\u201c PEPRA \u201d ), which became effective January 1,\n2013. PEPRA implements lower defined-benefit\nformulas with higher retirement ages for new\nState employees hired on or after January 1,\n2013, and includes provisions to increase\nemployee contributions. Both constitutional\ninitiatives and other State legislation have\nbeen circulated or proposed attempting to\nreform the State\u2019s pension systems on a State\nand local basis. The State Budget Overview .\nThe State\u2019s fiscal year begins on July 1 and\nends on June 30 of the following year. The\nannual budget is proposed by the Governor by\nJanuary 10 of each year for the next fiscal\nyear. Under State law, the Governor\u2019s Budget\ncannot provide for projected expenditures in\nexcess of projected revenues for the ensuing\nfiscal year. State law also requires the\nGovernor to update the Governor\u2019s Budget\nprojections and budgetary proposals in the May\nRevision by May 14 of each year. The May\nRevision is generally the basis for final\nnegotiations between the Governor and the\nState Legislature to reach agreement on\nappropriations and other legislation to fund\nState government and thus finalize the State\nBudget for the upcoming fiscal year. The\nbudget must be balanced, as required by\nProposition 58 (discussed below). The budget\nmust be approved by a majority of each house\nof the State Legislature. State law requires\nthe Governor to sign the budget by the start\nof the fiscal year on July 1. See \u201c Status of\nState General Fund; the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s\nBudget \u201d below. Constraints on the Budget\nProcess. Recent State constitutional\namendments approved by State voters have\naffected the budget process. Several such\namendments are described below. Balanced\nBudget Amendment (Proposition 58 and\nProposition 2). Proposition 58 . In 2004,\nvoters approved Proposition 58, a\nconstitutional amendment called the \u201c Balanced\nBudget Amendment, \u201d which requires the State\nto enact a balanced budget and establish a\nspecial reserve and restricts future borrowing\nto cover fiscal year-end deficits. As a result\nof the provisions requiring the enactment of a\nbalanced budget and restricting borrowing, the\nState would in some cases have to take more\nimmediate actions to correct budgetary\nshortfalls. Proposition 58 requires the State\nLegislature to pass a balanced budget and\nprovides for mid-year adjustments in the event\nthat the budget falls out of balance and the\nGovernor calls a special legislative session\nto address the shortfall. The balanced budget\ndetermination is made by subtracting\nexpenditures from all available resources,\nincluding prior-year balances.\n\n35\n\nUnder Proposition 58, if the Governor\ndetermines that the State is facing\nsubstantial revenue shortfalls or spending\nincreases, the Governor is authorized to\ndeclare a fiscal emergency. The Governor would\nthen be required to propose legislation to\naddress the emergency and call the State\nLegislature into special session for that\npurpose. If the State Legislature fails to\npass and send to the Governor legislation to\naddress the fiscal emergency within 45 days,\nthe State Legislature would be prohibited from\nacting on any other bills or adjourning in\njoint recess until such legislation is passed.\nNo fiscal emergency has been declared as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BSA is a\nspecial reserve account funded by annual\ntransfers of specified amounts from the\nGeneral Fund, unless suspended or reduced by\nthe Governor or until a specified maximum\namount has been deposited. Until the 2014-15\nBudget, the Governor had suspended the annual\ntransfer of money from the General Fund to the\nBSA every year since 2007. Proposition 2\nintended to strengthen the BSA by, among other\nthings, basing deposits on when capital gains\nrevenues rise above 8%, creating a Proposition\n98 reserve and doubling the maximum size of\nthe BSA from 5% to 10% of General Fund\nrevenues. Funding for the BSA is estimated by\nthe 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget to be\napproximately $23.1 billion as of June 30,\n2024 and approximately $11.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2025. Certain other provisions of\nProposition 58 relating to the BSA were\nreplaced by the provisions of Proposition 2.\nSee \u201c \u2014Proposition 2 \u201d below. Proposition 58\nalso prohibits certain future borrowing to\ncover fiscal year-end deficits. This\nrestriction applies to general obligation\nbonds, revenue bonds, and certain other forms\nof long-term borrowing. The restriction does\nnot apply to certain other types of borrowing,\nsuch as short-term borrowing to cover cash\nshortfalls in the General Fund (including\nrevenue anticipation notes or revenue\nanticipation warrants currently used by the\nState), or inter-fund borrowings. See \u201c Cash\nManagement \u201d above. Proposition 2 . In\naddition to the provisions described above,\nother provisions of Proposition 58 relating to\nthe BSA were replaced by the provisions of\nProposition 2 ( \u201c Proposition 2 \u201d ).\nProposition 2 requires that 1.5% of annual\nGeneral Fund revenues be deposited each year\ninto the BSA until the BSA balance reaches an\namount equal to 10% of General Fund revenues.\nProposition 2 also requires that half of the\nrevenues that otherwise would have been\ndeposited into the BSA through fiscal year\n2030-31 be used for supplemental payments to\npay down long-term liabilities. After fiscal\nyear 2030-31, the revenues that otherwise\nwould have been deposited into the BSA may be\nused for either supplemental debt payments or\nsavings. Proposition 2 further requires that\nwithdrawal of funds from the BSA be only for a\ndisaster or if spending remains at or below\nthe highest level of spending from the prior\nthree years. Proposition 2 limits the maximum\namount that could be withdrawn in the first\nyear of a recession to half of the BSA\u2019s\nbalance. It also requires the State to provide\na multiyear budget forecast to help better\nmanage the State\u2019s longer-term finances and to\ncreate a Proposition 98 reserve, whereby\nspikes in funding are to be saved for future\nyears to smooth school spending and minimize\nfuture cuts. State-Local Fiscal Relations .\nThe enactment of Proposition 1A in November\n2004 ( \u201c Proposition 1A of 2004 \u201d ) and\nProposition 22, or the \u201c Local Taxpayer,\nPublic Safety, and Transportation Protection\nAct of 2010 \u201d , in November 2010 ( \u201c\nProposition 22 \u201d ), significantly changed the\nfiscal relationship between the State and\nlocal governments by severely limiting the\nState\u2019s access to local funding sources.\nSpecifically, Proposition 1A of 2004 amended\nthe State Constitution to, among other things,\nreduce the State\u2019s access to property tax,\nsales tax and vehicle license fee revenues\nraised by local governments. Proposition 1A of\n2004 also prohibits the State from mandating\nactivities on cities, counties or special\ndistricts without providing funding to comply\nwith the mandates. If the State does not\nprovide funding for the mandated activity, the\nrequirement to abide by the mandate is\nsuspended. In addition, Proposition 22\nprohibits the State Legislature from, among\nother things, (i) taking or reallocating money\nraised by local governments for local\npurposes, (ii) making changes in the\nallocation of property taxes among local\ngovernments designed to aid State finances,\n(iii) using State fuel tax revenues to pay\ndebt service on State transportation bonds,\n(iv) borrowing or changing the distribution of\nState fuel tax revenues, and (v) using vehicle\nlicensing fee revenues to reimburse local\ngovernments for State-mandated costs. The\ninability of the State to borrow or redirect\nfunds from these sources, as it did during the\nGreat Recession in fiscal years 2008-09 and\n2009-10, will reduce the State\u2019s flexibility\nin reaching budget solutions in the future. On\nthe other hand, both Proposition 1A of 2004\nand Proposition 22 made the allocation of\nrevenues to local jurisdictions more\npredictable. Proposition 30 and Proposition 55\n. In 2012, voters approved \u201c The Schools and\nLocal Public Safety Protection Act of 2012 \u201d (\n\u201c Proposition 30 \u201d ), which provided temporary\nincreases in personal income tax rates for\nhigh-income taxpayers and a temporary increase\nin the State\u2019s sales tax rate. The sales tax\nportion of Proposition 30 expired on December\n31, 2016. In\n\n36\n\nNovember 2016, voters approved Proposition 55\n( \u201c Proposition 55 \u201d ), which extended the\npersonal income tax portion of Proposition 30\nuntil December 31, 2030. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget projected the revenue from\nthese additional tax brackets to be $8.2\nbillion in fiscal year 2022-23, $8.3 billion\nin fiscal year 2023-24, and $8.8 billion in\nfiscal year 2024-25. Health Care Services.\nMedi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program, is a\nhealth care entitlement program for qualified\nlow-income individuals and families who\nreceive public assistance or otherwise lack\nhealth care coverage and is one of the State\u2019s\nlargest expenditures. Medi-Cal is projected to\nhave an average monthly caseload of\napproximately 14.8 million Californians in\n2023-24 and 13.8 million in 2024-25, and Medi-\nCal covers more than one-third of the state\u2019s\npopulation. The 2022-23 Budget expanded Medi-\nCal coverage to income eligible adults aged 26\nthrough 49, regardless of immigration status,\nbeginning January 1, 2024. Medi-Cal currently\ncovers undocumented persons under the age of\n26. In the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget, the\nMedi-Cal budget includes $157.5 billion ($37.3\nbillion General Fund) in 2023-24 and $156.6\nbillion ($35.9 billion General Fund) in\n2024-25. The General Fund components\nrepresent, respectively, approximately 16.2%\nof estimated total 2023-24 General Fund\nexpenditures and 17.2% of estimated total\n2024-25 General Fund expenditures. The overall\nMedi-Cal budget may significantly change over\ntime, including within a single fiscal year,\ndue to its size, financial complexity, federal\nrequirements, and the fact that Medi-Cal\noperates on a cash, rather than an accrual,\nbasis of accounting, which means that the\ntiming of transactions can significantly\ndisrupt fiscal year budgetary estimates. In\naddition, the federal administration and\nleaders in Congress continue to consider and\npropose numerous changes to health and human\nservices programs. Many of the proposals could\nhave far-reaching impacts on health care in\nCalifornia and significant impacts to Medicaid\n(Medi-Cal in California). The net impact of\nhealth care costs on the General Fund\ncontinues to depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding federal legislation or\ninterpretations of existing federal law or\nregulations, levels of individual and employer\nparticipation, changes in insurance premiums,\nand the approval or enactment of solutions by\nthe State to address health care costs. Status\nof State General Fund; the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s\nBudget The 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget projected\ntotal general fund beginning balance, revenues\nand transfers of $222.7 billion for fiscal\nyear 2024-25, authorized expenditures of\n$208.7 billion for fiscal year 2024-25, and\nprojected that the State will end the 2024-25\nfiscal year with total available general fund\nreserves of $18.4 billion, including $3.4\nbillion in the SFEU, $11.1 billion in the BSA\nand $3.9 billion in the Public School System\nStabilization Account.

The\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget projected total\nGeneral Fund beginning balance, revenues and\ntransfers of $222.7 billion for fiscal year\n2024-25 (an approximately 6.8% decrease over\nestimated results for fiscal year 2023-24),\nauthorized expenditures of $208.7 billion for\nfiscal year 2024-25 (an approximately 9.6%\ndecrease from estimated results for fiscal\nyear 2023-24), and projected that the State\nwill end the 2024-25 fiscal year with total\navailable general fund reserves of $18.4\nbillion (an approximately 32.4% decrease from\nestimated results for fiscal year 2023-24).\nSee also, \u201c Status of State General Fund; the\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget \u201d below. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget projects modest revenue\ngrowth to resume following fiscal year\n2022-23, with revenues excluding transfers\nprojected to be 8.2% in fiscal year 2023-24\nand 2.8% in fiscal year 2024-25. The 2024-25\nGovernor\u2019s Budget forecast assumes continued\nbut moderating economic growth along with a\nstock market that is not significantly\ndifferent from its levels in mid-November\n2023. Due to the State\u2019s continued reliance on\nhigh-income taxpayers, who earn a significant\nproportion of their income from stock-based\ncompensation, the State\u2019s financial condition\ncontinues to be subject to volatility. If\nfinancial markets perform significantly worse\nor better than assumed, the revenue picture\nwill likely change accordingly. Several risks\nremain, including stock market volatility, an\neconomic recession, or any shocks that would\ndisproportionately impact high-income earners.\nThe 2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget indicates that\nthe May Revision for fiscal year 2024-25 could\ninclude additional corrective budgetary\nactions. Recent news reports indicate\npreliminary agreement among the Governor and\nleaders of his party in the Legislature to\nseek certain expenditure cuts to address a\nportion of the deficit. The May Revision of\nthe 2024-25 budget proposal may detail those\ncuts and other budget measures when released.\nPending Litigation There are currently\nnumerous legal proceedings pending against the\nState that, if determined adversely against\nthe State, could affect the State\u2019s\nexpenditures and, in some cases, its revenues\nand cash flow. Information regarding some of\nthe more significant litigation pending\nagainst the State would ordinarily be included\nin various public documents issued by the\nState, such as the official statements\nprepared in connection with the issuance of\ngeneral obligation bonds of California. See \u201c\nAdditional Information \u201d below for information\non how to obtain such official statements.\nBond Ratings As of March 26, 2024, the\nfollowing ratings for the State\u2019s general\nobligation bonds have been received from\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc.

Any explanation of\nthe significance of such ratings may be\nobtained only from the rating agency\nfurnishing such ratings. There is no assurance\nthat such ratings will continue for any given\nperiod of time or that they will not be\nrevised downward or withdrawn entirely if, in\nthe judgment of the particular rating agency,\ncircumstances so warrant. Additional\nInformation Information regarding the State\u2019s\nfinancial condition is included in various\npublic documents issued by the State, such as\nthe official statements prepared in connection\nwith the issuance of general obligation bonds\nof California. Such official statements may be\nobtained by contacting the State Treasurer\u2019s\nOffice at (800) 900-3873 or at\nwww.buycaliforniabonds.com . Periodic reports\non revenues and/or expenditures during the\nfiscal year are issued by the Administration,\nthe State Controller\u2019s Office and the LAO. The\nDepartment of Finance issues a monthly\nbulletin, which reports the most recent\nrevenue receipts as reported by State\ndepartments, comparing those receipts to\nbudget projections. The State Controller\nissues a\n\n38\n\nmonthly report on General Fund cash receipts\nand disbursements. These reports are normally\nreleased on the 10 th day of every calendar\nmonth for the period ended on the last day of\nthe prior month. The Administration also\nformally updates its budget projections three\ntimes during each fiscal year \u2014 in January,\nMay and at the time of budget enactment.\nCurrently, many of these bulletins and reports\nare available on the State\u2019s investor\nrelations website ( www.buycaliforniabonds.com\n) or on websites maintained by the applicable\nagencies and by contacting the agencies at\ntheir offices in Sacramento, California.\nInvestors are cautioned that interim financial\ninformation is not necessarily indicative of\nresults for a fiscal year.

None of the\ninformation on the above websites is\nincorporated herein by reference. Local\nGovernments General. The primary units of\nlocal government in California are the 58\ncounties, which range in population from less\nthan 1,200 in Alpine County to over 10 million\nin Los Angeles County. Counties are\nresponsible for the provision of many basic\nservices, including indigent health care,\nwelfare, jails, and public safety in\nunincorporated areas. As of April 2024, there\nwere 482 incorporated cities in California and\nthousands of special districts formed to\nprovide various services. Commencing with the\n2011-12 Budget, the State implemented a\nrealignment plan to shift certain State\nprogram costs to counties and provided a\ncomparable amount of funds to support these\nnew county commitments. Under the realignment\nplan, ongoing funds for such programs are\nrequired to be provided to counties for court\nsecurity, corrections and public safety,\nmental health services, substance abuse\ntreatment, child welfare programs, adult\nprotective services, and CalWORKs. However,\nState transfers (projected to approximately\n$10.5 billion in fiscal year 2024-25 under the\n2024-25 Governor\u2019s Budget) do not cover all\nthe costs of such programs. Consequently,\nlocal governments, particularly counties, have\nborne an increased part of the financial\nburden of providing program services,\nincluding the risks of cost overruns, revenue\ndeclines and insufficient revenue growth. To\nthe extent the State is constrained by its\nobligation to schools under Proposition 98 or\nother fiscal considerations, the absolute\nlevel (or the rate of growth) of State\nassistance to local governments may be\naffected. Any such reductions in State aid\ncould compound the serious fiscal constraints\nalready experienced by many local governments,\nparticularly counties and schools. See \u201c\nProposition 98 and K-14 Funding. \u201d School\ndistricts generally maintain some level of\noperating reserves; however, for certain\nschool districts this may not be sufficient to\naddress any drop in revenue available to\nschools due to reductions in the Proposition\n98 Guarantee, other revenue losses and\nincreased costs. See \u201c Proposition 98 and K-14\nFunding \u201d above. While it is impossible to\ndescribe in detail the impact on specific\nlocal bond issuances, the economic effects and\nsocietal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will\ncontinue to affect or impair the credit\nquality of a variety of local California\nissuances. Many of the largest cities in the\nState, including notably San Francisco, Los\nAngeles and Oakland, have experienced some of\nthe highest office vacancy rates in the\nCountry. While the long-term consequences of\nthe pandemic are yet to be known, and will\nvary among jurisdictions, cities have\ncautioned that they could experience reduced\nlocal government property and other business-\nrelated tax revenue due to the reduced value\nof office properties. However, local\ngovernments that are experiencing declining\nrevenues and increased expenses due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic or other local factors are\nlimited in their ability to levy and raise\nproperty taxes and other forms of taxes, fees\nor assessments, due to State constitutional as\nwell as (in some cases) local initiatives.\nLocal governments are also constrained by\nbalanced budget requirements and prohibitions\non long-term borrowing for operating costs. As\na consequence of these factors, local\ngovernments may increasingly be forced to cut\nlocal services to address budget shortfalls or\nto take even more drastic actions, such as a\nbankruptcy filing. Many local governments are\nalso facing substantial increases in pension\nliabilities and health care costs for\nretirees. Any declines in the U.S. and global\nstock markets could have a material impact on\nthe investments in the State pension trusts,\n\n39\n\nwhich could materially increase the unfunded\nactuarial accrued liability for CalPERS and\nCalSTRS, which, in turn, could result in\nmaterial changes to required contribution\nrates for local governments in future fiscal\nyears. In the case of school districts,\ncontributions to CalSTRS are determined by the\nState Legislature, and the State had\npreviously enacted legislation to increase\nrequired contributions to pay rising pension\ncosts. However, to the extent such required\ncontributions exceed available funding, local\ngovernment finances will continue to be\nadversely affected. For more information\nregarding pension liabilities, see \u201c State and\nLocal Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities\n\u201d above. Constitutional and Statutory\nLimitations on Local Government. The fiscal\ncondition of local governments was changed\nwhen Proposition 13, which added Article XIIIA\nto the State Constitution, was approved by\nCalifornia voters in 1978. Proposition 13\nreduced and limited the future growth of\nproperty taxes and limited the ability of\nlocal governments to impose \u201c special taxes \u201d\n(i.e., those devoted to a specific purpose)\nwithout two-thirds voter approval. Although\nProposition 13 limited property tax growth\nrates, it also has had a smoothing effect on\nproperty tax revenues, ensuring greater\nstability in annual revenues than existed\nbefore Proposition 13 passed. For further\ninformation on Proposition 13, see \u201c\nConstitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other\nCharges, Appropriations and General Fund\nRevenues \u2014 Limitation on Property Taxes \u201d\nabove. Proposition 218, a constitutional\namendment enacted by initiative in 1996,\nfurther limited the ability of local\ngovernments to raise taxes, fees, and other\nexactions. See \u201c Constitutional Limitations on\nTaxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and\nGeneral Fund Revenues \u2014 Limitations on Other\nTaxes, Fees and Charges \u201d above. Proposition\n62, a statutory initiative adopted by the\nvoters in 1986, includes limitations on the\nability of local governments to raise taxes\nthat are similar to those included in the\nlater constitutional amendments of Proposition\n218. In the aftermath of Proposition 13, the\nState provided aid to local governments from\nthe General Fund to make up some of the loss\nof property tax moneys, including assuming\nprincipal responsibility for funding K-12\nschools and community colleges. During the\nrecession of the early 1990s, the State\nLegislature reduced the post-Proposition 13\naid to local government entities other than\nK-12 schools and community colleges by\nrequiring cities and counties to transfer some\nof their property tax revenues to school\ndistricts. However, the State Legislature also\nprovided additional funding sources, such as\nsales taxes, and reduced certain mandates for\nlocal services funded by cities and counties.\nBeginning in 2000, and in part caused by the \u201c\ninternet bubble, \u201d the State was faced with\nincreasing financial stress and began to\ndivert local revenue resources, including\nsales tax, vehicle license fees and\nredevelopment moneys, to the State coffers.\nThe 2004-05 Budget, related legislation and\nthe enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 and\nProposition 22 dramatically changed the State-\nlocal fiscal relationship. Proposition 1A of\n2004 amended the State Constitution to, among\nother things, reduce the State Legislature\u2019s\nauthority over local government revenue\nsources by placing restrictions on the State\u2019s\naccess to local governments\u2019 property, sales,\nand vehicle license fee revenues as of\nNovember 3, 2004. Proposition 22, which\nsupersedes Proposition 1A of 2004, completely\nprohibits any future borrowing by the State\nfrom local government funds and generally\nprohibits the State Legislature from making\nchanges in local government funding sources.\nFor further discussion regarding Proposition\n22 and Proposition 1A of 2004, see \u201c The State\nBudget \u2014 Balanced Budget Amendment\n(Proposition 58 and Proposition 2) \u2014 State-\nLocal Fiscal Relations \u201d above. Obligations of\nOther Issuers Other Issuers of California Debt\nObligations. There are a number of State\nagencies, instrumentalities and political\nsubdivisions of the State that issue municipal\nobligations, some of which may be conduit\nrevenue obligations payable from payments from\nprivate borrowers. These entities are subject\nto various economic risks and uncertainties,\nand the credit quality of the securities\nissued by them may vary considerably from the\ncredit quality of obligations backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the State. See \u201c\nLocal Governments \u2014 General \u201d above. For\nexample, assessment bonds may be adversely\naffected by a general decline in real estate\nvalues or a slowdown in real estate sales\nactivity. California Long-Term Lease\nObligations. Based on a series of court\ndecisions, certain long-term lease\nobligations, though typically payable from the\nGeneral Fund or a municipality, are not\nconsidered \u201c indebtedness \u201d requiring voter\napproval. Such leases, however, are subject to\n\u201c abatement \u201d in the event the facility being\nleased is unavailable for beneficial use and\noccupancy by the municipality during the term\nof the lease. Abatement is not a default, and\nthere may be no remedies available to the\nholders of the certificates evidencing the\nlease obligation in the event abatement\noccurs. The most common cases of abatement are\nfailure to complete construction of the\nfacility before the end of the period during\nwhich lease payments have been capitalized and\nuninsured casualty losses to the facility\n(e.g., due to earthquake). In the event\nabatement\n\n40\n\noccurs with respect to a lease obligation,\nlease payments may be interrupted (if all\navailable insurance proceeds and reserves are\nexhausted) and the certificates may not be\npaid when due. Further, lease obligations may\nrepresent executory contracts that could be\nrejected in a bankruptcy proceeding under\nChapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy\nCode. In recent bankruptcy proceedings\ninvolving the City of Stockton, the confirmed\nplan of adjustment included the discharge of\nlease obligations at significant discounts\nfrom their face value. Statutory Lien Securing\nGeneral Obligation Bonds . Certain local\ngovernments, particularly school districts,\nissue general obligation bonds secured by ad\nvalorem property taxes. Effective January 1,\n2016, provisions were added to the California\nEducation Code and the California Government\nCode to provide that general obligation bonds\nissued and sold by local governments in\nCalifornia are secured by a statutory lien on\nthe ad valorem property taxes levied and\ncollected to pay the principal and interest on\nsuch general obligation bonds. A statutory\nlien provides bondholders with a security\ninterest in ad valorem property taxes intended\nto survive a bankruptcy of the local\ngovernment. It is unclear whether these\nprovisions apply to bonds issued prior to the\neffective date. Other Factors Inflation,\nInterest Rates and Recession. Historically,\nCalifornia inflation rates have generally been\nsomewhat higher than the nation\u2019s inflation\nrates due to the state\u2019s faster increases in\nhousing and energy prices. California\ninflation peaked at 8.3% year-over-year in\nJune 2022 but has slowed to 3.2% as of October\n2023 (the latest available data). High\ninflation in 2021 and 2022 was largely driven\nby supply chain disruptions and demand shifts\nfrom services to goods, both of which were due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues have\nmostly been resolved, although inflation has\nnot yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nSustained high inflation can lead to price\ninstability if businesses and consumers expect\nprice increases to continue. The Federal\nReserve has responded to elevated inflation by\nincreasing the target federal funds rate\neleven times from March 2022 to July 2023 to a\ntarget range of 5.25% to 5.5% and has\nindicated that it expects to cut target rates\nat some point in 2024 but that it will\nmaintain high rates until inflation nears its\ntarget level of around 2%. The uncertain\nextent of future monetary tightening\ncontributes to economic risk. The recent\ntightening of U.S. monetary policy has the\npotential to limit household and business\nborrowing and induce a deeper economic\nslowdown than projected. COVID-19 Pandemic and\nSocial and Economic Impacts. The COVID-19\npandemic continues to affect global health and\nmay continue to lead to governmental responses\nwhich negatively impact the economy. There can\nbe no assurances that there will not be a\nresurgence of COVID-19 cases and deaths, that\nexisting or new COVID-19 variants will not\nincrease the public health crisis or that\nunavailability and/or lack of public\nacceptance of vaccines will not exacerbate or\nprolong the adverse impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic. There is also no assurance that any\nadditional federal aid will be forthcoming for\nthe State or its local governments. The long-\nterm consequences of the pandemic are yet to\nbe known. For instance, if there are broad,\nlong-standing changes to where people chose to\nlive and work, the pandemic could, over time,\nchange the key economic drivers of a\ncommunity. As an example, some employers may\ncontinue to provide additional flexibility for\ntheir employee remote work policies instituted\nduring the COVID 19 emergency. These unknowns\ncreate an unprecedented degree of uncertainty\nabout the economic outlook of local\ngovernments. These changes also could affect\nthe value of commercial property and over time\nlead to deceleration in local government\nproperty tax revenue growth. Many of the\nlargest cities in the State, including notably\nSan Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have\nexperienced some of the highest office vacancy\nrates in the Country. Among other reasons,\nthese vacancy rates reflect a reliance upon\njobs in the technology industry (which are the\nmost vulnerable to remote working), as well as\nthe impact of homelessness and crime upon the\nattractiveness of certain commercial areas.\nHigher vacancy rates are resulting in\ndramatically lower commercial property values,\nwhich in turn are projected to result in lower\nproperty taxes and other business tax revenue.\nThese tax reductions, as well as increased\ncosts to address homelessness and crime could\nstrain municipal budgets, potentially putting\npressure on their credit quality. Global\nRelations and Trade. Given globalization and\nthe interconnectedness of physical and\nfinancial world markets, disruptions in large\nmarkets due to economic slowdowns in other\ncountries or regions, geopolitical tensions\nand deteriorating international trade\nrelations, may have significant negative\nimpacts on the nation\u2019s economy, including on\nthe State. There is significant uncertainty\naround how the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\nthe conflict in Israel and Gaza and increased\ntensions between China and Taiwan will evolve,\nas well as the potential economic impacts to\nthe U.S. and to California from these\nconflicts. Current global instabilities\nincluding within the U.S.\u2019s largest trading\npartner, China, may disrupt the global\neconomy.\n\n41\n\nPotential trade disruptions could create\nsupply chain problems such as those caused by\nshutdowns of facilities during the COVID-19\npandemic. Global supply chain disruptions\ncould negatively impact domestic markets and\nreduced trade volumes for the nation and the\nState. Recent information shows decreased\nexports. The State\u2019s exports of goods totaled\n$178.7 billion in 2023, or 4.0% lower than the\n$186.2 billion total in 2022. Also, these\neffects could potentially reduce wages and\nemployment in the short run and could trigger\na change in the business model of companies\nthat until now have based significant\ninvestment decisions on the assumption of\ngenerally free global trade. Material changes\nin federal trade policy, including new or\nrevised tariffs on the State\u2019s trading\npartners, could directly and indirectly impact\nthe State\u2019s economy. The 2019 U.S. tariffs of\nup to 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese\nproducts, equivalent to half of the nation\u2019s\nimports from China, remain in place through at\nleast the end of May 2024. These tariffs\ntriggered Chinese retaliatory tariffs of 25%\non over $50 billion worth of U.S. exports.\nBecause the State is a transport hub, and\nChina is the State\u2019s largest trading partner\nby total trade value of goods (based on 2022\nannual average data), an ongoing trade war\ncould have negative effects on the State\u2019s\neconomy. Health Care Costs. Medi-Cal is one of\nthe State\u2019s largest expenditures. The State\nalso provides health benefits to its own\nemployees and retirees. General Fund spending\non health care costs is thus heavily dependent\nupon the rate of health care cost inflation.\nIf this inflation rises faster than expected,\nannual General Fund spending could quickly\nrise by hundreds of millions of dollars. See \u201c\nThe State Budget \u2013 Health Care Services. \u201d\nHousing Constraints; Homelessness. The State\ncontinues to face a critical housing shortage\ndespite authorizing 113,000 residential units\nin 2022 and 102,500 through November 2023,\nmodest declines from the 2021 total of 119,660\nunits, which was the highest annual figure\nsince 2006. As of April 2024, the State\nestimated that residential permits had\ndeclined in 2023 compared to 2022.\nExceptionally strong housing demand driven by\nhigh-income earners in 2021 through early 2022\ndrove the California median sales price (not\nseasonally adjusted) for existing single-\nfamily homes to a record high of $893,200 in\nMay 2022. However, as interest rate hikes\npushed up mortgage rates, the demand for\nhousing weakened, and by November 2023 the\nmedian sale price for housing was down to\n$822,200. Low-income and moderate-income\nCalifornians face increasing affordability\nissues which may affect their decisions about\nwhere to live and work. Given the State\u2019s\nstructural housing supply constraints and\nshortage, low-income populations will be\nespecially vulnerable to housing cost\nincreases both in the rental and ownership\nmarkets. Furthermore, certain businesses may\ndetermine to leave California to the extent\nlocation decisions are significantly\ninfluenced by the ability of their employees\nand customers to live nearby. In addition, in\ncertain urban areas in particular, the\nhomeless population has grown in recent years,\nin some part due to a significant lack of\naffordable housing. In certain urban centers,\nlike San Francisco, the impact of\nhomelessness, together with the dramatic\nincrease of drug-related use and property\ncrime, has caused major retailers to close\ntheir facilities, resulting in a significant\nloss of tax revenues. Further, homeless\nservices programs may become a larger draw on\nlocal government funds and may otherwise\nimpact economic activity. Climate Change. The\nState historically has been susceptible to\nwildfires and hydrologic variability. In April\n2023, the State disclosed that as greenhouse\ngas emissions continue to accumulate, climate\nchange will intensify and increase the\nfrequency of extreme weather events, such as\ncoastal storm surges, drought, wildfires,\nfloods and heat waves, and raise sea levels\nalong the coast of the State. Over the past\nseveral years, the State has already\nexperienced the impacts of climate change\nthrough multiple drought periods, flooding and\nunprecedented wildfires. The State was subject\nto a five-year drought from 2012 to 2016, and\nthe state recently suffered a multi-year\ndrought that ended in early 2023, following\nwinter storms. Dry weather increases wildfire\nrisk, and future drought conditions may impact\nfuture economic forecasts. In 2020, over 4\nmillion acres burned in California, more than\ntwice the previous record of approximately 2\nmillion acres in 2018. Destruction of housing\nincreases the demand for construction\nresources from rebuilding and worsens the\nState\u2019s housing imbalances for years following\nthe incidents. During the 2022-23 winter, the\nstate experienced significant storms leading\nto severe flooding in various locations\nthroughout the state, and by April 2023 the\nflooding had caused the state to declare\nemergencies in 51 of the state\u2019s 58 counties.\nThe 2022-23 winter storms brought historic\nlevels of snow and the associated snowmelt as\ntemperatures increased through the spring\nresulted in significant flooding in various\nregions of the state. The increasing frequency\nof natural disasters within the State,\nparticularly wildfires, has led to rising home\ninsurance premiums, as well as resulted in\nsome insurers either limiting or discontinuing\nissuance of policies, which could further\nweaken housing development in the State and\nexacerbate the ongoing housing shortage.\nAdditional costs incurred by insurance\ncompanies could likely get passed down to\nexisting or prospective policyholders in the\nform of higher premiums, which may amplify the\nState\u2019s lack of housing affordability. The\nfuture fiscal impact of climate change on the\nState budget is difficult to predict, but it\n\n42\n\ncould be significant. The State is in the\nprocess of implementing various resilience\nmeasures to reduce the impacts of climate\nchange, including significant investments in\nwildfire prevention and water infrastructure\nprojects and workforce development. The\nability of the State to take actions to\nmitigate any future fiscal impact of climate\nchange on the State budget is limited and\nthere can be no assurances that the current or\nany future resilience measures will be\neffective in materially mitigating the impact\nof climate change on the State. Energy Risks.\nThe State disclosed in April 2023 that another\nresult of unprecedented climate-induced\nweather events, including drought, extreme\nheat events and wildfires, is stress on the\nState\u2019s electrical system. The future fiscal\nimpact of stresses to the energy grid caused\nby climate is difficult for the State to\npredict but could be significant. In recent\nyears, California has taken numerous steps to\nincrease resiliency to be better prepared to\nmeet the State\u2019s electricity demands. This\nincludes demand response programs and creating\nadditional incentives to move large energy\nusers to back-up power generation to address\nreliability concerns and streamlining certain\npermitting requirements to allow greater\nenergy production. Cybersecurity Risks . The\nState, like many other large public and\nprivate entities, relies on a large and\ncomplex technology environment to conduct its\noperations. The State\u2019s reliance on this\nenvironment has increased due to higher rates\nof telework as initially mandated by public\nhealth measures. As a recipient and provider\nof personal, private and/or sensitive\ninformation, the State is subject to multiple\ncyber threats including, but not limited to,\nhacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on\ncomputer and other sensitive digital networks\nand systems. Entities or individuals may\nattempt to gain unauthorized access to the\nState\u2019s digital systems for the purposes of\nmisappropriating assets or information or\ncausing operational disruption and damage. In\n2017 the State established a statewide\nsecurity operations center to protect against\nmalicious activity targeting critical\ntechnology infrastructure. Local governments\nin the State have experienced similar threats\nand taken similar measures; however, no\nassurances can be given that the efforts to\nmanage cyber threats and attacks will be\nsuccessful or that any such attack will not\nmaterially impact the operations or finances\nof the State or its local governments.\nEarthquake Risk. Substantially all of\nCalifornia is within an active geologic region\nsubject to major seismic activity. Northern\nCalifornia in 1989 and Southern California in\n1994 experienced major earthquakes causing\nbillions of dollars in damages. The federal\ngovernment provided more than $13 billion in\naid for both earthquakes, and neither event\nhas had any long-term negative economic\nimpact. Any obligation of a local government\nin the State could be affected by an\ninterruption of revenues because of damaged\nfacilities or, consequently, income tax\ndeductions for casualty losses or property tax\nassessment reductions. Compensatory financial\nassistance could be constrained by the\ninability of (i) an issuer to have obtained\nearthquake insurance coverage; (ii) an insurer\nto perform on its contracts of insurance in\nthe event of widespread losses; or (iii) the\nfederal or State government to appropriate\nsufficient funds within their respective\nbudget limitations. Future Tax Deadline Delays\n. Due to federal disaster declarations\nresulting from severe winter storms, the IRS\nannounced that taxpayers in certain counties\nof the state could delay filing their 2022 tax\nyear federal tax returns. The initial delay\nwas until October 16, 2023, but this delay was\nextended to November 16, 2023. This delay, to\nwhich the state conformed for filing of 2022\ntax year state tax returns, occurred in 55 of\nthe state\u2019s 58 counties, comprising 99% of all\nCalifornia taxpayers, and affected tax\ncollections that were due as early as January\n2023. As a result, the revenue forecast for\nthe 2023-24 Budget Act was completed without\ncritical cash data that would normally have\nbeen available, which significantly increased\nforecasting uncertainty, including for the\nprior fiscal year. This led to a delayed\nrecognition of the extent of the revenue\ncorrection and reduced the state\u2019s flexibility\nin addressing the resulting significant\nshortfall. Any future tax deadline delays\nannounced by the IRS, if conformed to by the\nstate, could have a similar detrimental effect\non the state\u2019s ability to forecast tax\nrevenues and appropriately adjust budgetary\nspending to align with revenues and any\npayment delays could create liquidity\nchallenges. San Diego County Tax Deadline\nDelay . On February 27, 2024, the IRS granted\ntax relief to taxpayers in San Diego County\nwho were impacted by severe storms and\nflooding in late January 2024 by postponing\nvarious personal income and business tax\nfiling and payments deadlines to June 17,\n2024, and the state subsequently conformed by\nsimilarly delaying its corresponding filing\nand payment deadlines. For tax year 2022, San\nDiego County accounted for about 7% of total\npersonal income taxes collected in the state\n($7.7 billion out of $104.6 billion) and less\nthan 0.1% of total corporation taxes. As a\nresult, the revenue forecast for the May\nRevision for fiscal year 2024-25 will be\ncompleted without certain cash data for San\nDiego County taxpayers that would normally be\navailable. Special Considerations Regarding\nInvestments in New York Municipal Securities\n\n43\n\nThe following information is a brief summary\nof factors affecting the economy of New York\nCity (the \u201c City \u201d or \u201c New York City \u201d ) or\nNew York State (the \u201c State \u201d , \u201c New York \u201d\nor \u201c NYS \u201d ) and does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of such factors. Other\nfactors will affect issuers. The summary is\nbased primarily upon the most recent publicly\navailable offering statements relating to debt\nofferings of state and local issuers and other\nfinancial and demographic information, as of\nMarch 27, 2024 with respect to the City and\nFebruary 15, 2024 with respect to the State,\nand it does not reflect recent developments\nsince the dates of such offering statements\nand other information. Neither the Fund nor\nits legal counsel has independently verified\nthis information. The State, some of its\nagencies, instrumentalities and public\nauthorities and certain of its municipalities\nhave sometimes faced serious financial\ndifficulties that could have an adverse effect\non the sources of payment for, or the market\nvalue of, the New York municipal bonds in\nwhich the Fund invests. NEW YORK CITY General\n. The City, with an estimated population of\napproximately 8.3 million as of July 2023, is\nan international center of business and\nculture. Its non-manufacturing economy is\nbroadly based, with the banking, securities,\ninsurance, technology, information,\npublishing, fashion, design, retailing,\neducation and health care industries\naccounting for a significant portion of the\nCity\u2019s total employment earnings.\nAdditionally, the City is a leading tourist\ndestination. Manufacturing activity in the\nCity is conducted primarily in apparel and\nprinting. For each of the 1981 through 2023\nfiscal years, the City\u2019s General Fund had an\noperating surplus, before discretionary and\nother transfers, and achieved balanced\noperating results as reported in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\n( \u201c GAAP \u201d ), after discretionary and other\ntransfers and except for the application of\nGovernmental Accounting Standards Board ( \u201c\nGASB \u201d ) Statement No. 49 ( \u201c GASB 49 \u201d ) and\nwithout regard to certain fund balances, which\nmay be carried forward as described below.\nCity fiscal years end on June 30 and are\nreferred to by the calendar year in which they\nend. The City has been required to close\nsubstantial gaps between forecast revenues and\nforecast expenditures in order to maintain\nbalanced operating results. There can be no\nassurance that the City will continue to\nmaintain balanced operating results as\nrequired by State law without proposed tax or\nother revenue increases or reductions in City\nservices or entitlement programs, which could\nadversely affect the City\u2019s economic base. As\nrequired by the New York State Financial\nEmergency Act For The City of New York (the \u201c\nFinancial Emergency Act \u201d ) and the New York\nCity Charter (the \u201c City Charter \u201d ), the City\nprepares a four-year annual financial plan,\nwhich is reviewed and revised on a quarterly\nbasis and which includes the City\u2019s capital,\nrevenue and expense projections and outlines\nproposed gap-closing programs for years with\nprojected budget gaps. The City\u2019s current\nfinancial plan projects budget balance in the\n2024 and 2025 fiscal years in accordance with\nGAAP except for the application of GASB 49 and\nwithout regard to certain fund balances, which\nmay be carried forward as described below. In\n2010, the Financial Emergency Act was amended\nto waive the budgetary impact of GASB 49 by\nenabling the City to continue to finance with\nbond proceeds certain pollution remediation\ncosts. In addition, the City may, without\nviolating its budget balance requirements,\ncarry forward to a subsequent fiscal year or\nfiscal years unspent balances from certain\nfunds restricted as to their use, as well as\nbalances in the Health Insurance Stabilization\nFund, School Crossing Guards Health Insurance\nFund, Management Benefits Fund and Revenue\nStabilization Fund. The City\u2019s current\nfinancial plan projects budget gaps for the\n2026 through 2028 fiscal years. A pattern of\ncurrent year balance and projected future year\nbudget gaps has been consistent through the\nentire period since 1982, during which the\nCity has achieved an excess of revenues over\nexpenditures, before discretionary and other\ntransfers, for each fiscal year. The City is\nrequired to submit its financial plans to the\nNew York State Financial Control Board (the \u201c\nControl Board \u201d ). For its normal operations,\nthe City depends on aid from the State both to\nenable the City to balance its budget and to\nmeet its cash requirements. There can be no\nassurance that there will not be delays or\nreductions in State aid to the City from\namounts currently projected; that State\nbudgets for future State fiscal years will be\nadopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, or\ninterim appropriations will be enacted; or\nthat any such reductions or delays will not\nhave adverse effects on the City\u2019s cash flow\nor expenditures. In addition, the City has\nmade various assumptions with respect to\nfederal aid. Future federal actions or\ninactions could have adverse effects on the\nCity, both directly and indirectly through\nState aid to localities reductions that will\nneed to be taken in the absence of additional\nfederal aid to the State.\n\n44\n\nThe Mayor is responsible under the City\nCharter for preparing the City\u2019s annual\nexpense and capital budgets (as adopted, the \u201c\nExpense Budget \u201d and the \u201c Capital Budget, \u201d\nrespectively, and collectively, the \u201c Budgets\n\u201d ) and for submitting the Budgets to the City\nCouncil for its review and adoption. The\nExpense Budget covers the City\u2019s operating\nexpenditures for municipal services, while the\nCapital Budget covers expenditures for capital\nprojects, as defined in the City Charter, in\neach case for the City fiscal year. Operations\nunder the Expense Budget must reflect the\naggregate expenditure limitations contained in\nfinancial plans. The Mayor is also responsible\nfor preparing the City\u2019s financial plan, which\nrelates to the City and certain entities that\nreceive funds from the City. The financial\nplan is modified quarterly. The City\u2019s\nprojections set forth in the financial plan\nare based on various assumptions and\ncontingencies which are uncertain and which\nmay not materialize. Such assumptions and\ncontingencies include the condition of the\ninternational, national, regional and local\neconomies, the provision of State and federal\naid and other State and federal actions and\ninactions, such as the potential consequences\nof not resolving the federal debt ceiling\nnegotiations, the impact on City revenues and\nexpenditures of any future federal or State\nlegislation and policies affecting the City\nand the cost of pension structures and\nhealthcare. Implementation of the financial\nplan is dependent on the City\u2019s ability to\nsuccessfully market its bonds and notes.\nImplementation of the financial plan is also\ndependent upon the ability to market the\nsecurities of other financing entities\nincluding the New York City Municipal Water\nFinance Authority (the \u201c Water Authority \u201d )\nand the New York City Transitional Finance\nAuthority ( \u201c TFA \u201d ). The success of\nprojected public sales of City, Water\nAuthority, TFA and other bonds and notes will\nbe subject to prevailing market conditions.\nFuture developments in the financial markets\ngenerally, as well as future developments\nconcerning the City, and public discussion of\nsuch developments, may affect the market for\noutstanding City general obligation bonds and\nnotes. The City Comptroller and other agencies\nand public officials, from time to time, issue\nreports and make public statements which,\namong other things, state that projected\nrevenues and expenditures may be different\nfrom those forecast in the City\u2019s financial\nplans. City Financial Plan . For the 2023\nfiscal year, the City\u2019s General Fund had a\ntotal surplus of $5.48 billion, before\ndiscretionary and other transfers, and\nachieved balanced operating results in\naccordance with GAAP, except for the\napplication of GASB 49 and without regard to\ncertain fund balances permitted to be carried\nforward, after discretionary and other\ntransfers. The 2023 fiscal year was the forty-\nthird consecutive year that the City achieved\nbalanced operating results when reported in\naccordance with GAAP, except for the\napplication of GASB 49 and without regard to\ncertain fund balances permitted to be carried\nforward. 2024-2028 Financial Plan On June 30,\n2023, the City submitted to the Control Board\nthe financial plan for the 2023 through 2027\nfiscal years (the \u201c June Financial Plan \u201d ),\nwhich was consistent with the City\u2019s capital\nand expense budgets as adopted for the 2024\nfiscal year. On November 16, 2023, the City\nsubmitted to the Control Board a modification\nto the June Financial Plan (as so modified,\nthe \u201c November Financial Plan \u201d ). On January\n16, 2024, the Mayor released the preliminary\nbudget for the 2025 fiscal year and the City\nsubmitted to the Control Board a modification\nto the November Financial Plan for the 2024\nthrough 2028 fiscal years (as so modified, the\n\u201c Financial Plan \u201d ). The Financial Plan\nprojects revenues and expenses for the 2024\nand 2025 fiscal years balanced in accordance\nwith GAAP, except as described above, and\nprojects gaps of approximately $5.15 billion,\n$5.12 billion and $6.04 billion in fiscal\nyears 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. The\nJune Financial Plan had projected revenues and\nexpenses for the 2024 fiscal year balanced in\naccordance with GAAP, except as described\nabove, and had projected gaps of approximately\n$5.08 billion, $6.84 billion and $7.9 billion\nin fiscal years 2025 through 2027,\nrespectively. The Financial Plan reflects,\nsince the June Financial Plan, increases in\nprojected net revenues of $2.44 billion, $2.58\nbillion, $2.53 billion and $2.82 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively.\nChanges in projected revenues include: (i)\nincreases in real property tax revenues of\n$114 million, $962 million, $1.35 billion and\n$1.7 billion in fiscal years 2024 through\n2027, respectively; (ii) increases in personal\nincome tax and pass-through entity tax\nrevenues of $1.06 billion, $903 million, $677\nmillion and $645 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2027, respectively; (iii) increases in\nbusiness tax revenues of $ 1.14 billion, $663\nmillion, $688 million and $694 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively;\n(iv) increases in sales tax revenues of $154\nmillion, $88 million, $67 million and $36\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; (v) decreases in real estate\ntransaction tax revenues of $628 million, $567\nmillion, $457 million and $435 million in\nfiscal years\n\n45\n\n2024 through 2027, respectively; (vi)\ndecreases in State School Tax Relief Program (\n\u201c STAR Program \u201d ) revenues of $8 million in\neach of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (vii)\nincreases in hotel tax revenues of $31\nmillion, $18 million, $21 million and $10\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; and (viii) decreases in other\ntax revenues of $2 million, $8 million and $4\nmillion in fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2027,\nrespectively, and an increase in other tax\nrevenues of $3 million in fiscal year 2026.\nChanges in projected revenues also include (i)\nnet increases in non-tax revenues of $264\nmillion, $99 million, $63 million and $51\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; (ii) increases in rental\npayments from the Water Board (defined below)\nof $145 million and $295 million in each of\nfiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively; and\n(iii) increases in revenues included in the\nProgram to Eliminate the Gap (the \u201c PEG \u201d ) of\n$175 million, $131 million, $129 million and\n$124 million in fiscal years 2024 through\n2027, respectively. The Financial Plan also\nreflects, since the June Financial Plan, a net\ndecrease in projected net expenditures of\n$1.34 billion in fiscal year 2024 and net\nincreases in projected net expenditures of\n$1.28 billion, $842 million and $32 million in\nfiscal years 2025 through 2027, respectively.\nChanges in projected expenditures include: (i)\nincreases in agency expenses of $3.08 billion,\n$539 million, $714 million and $1.04 billion\nin fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; (ii) decreases in certain\nexpenses included in the PEG of $2.22 billion,\n$2.37 billion, $2.28 billion and $2.3 billion\nin fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; (iii) increases in certain\nrestorations included in the PEG of $66\nmillion, $129 million, $133 million and $135\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2027,\nrespectively; (iv) decreases in certain costs\nof providing services to asylum seekers\nincluded in the PEG of $515 million and $1.23\nbillion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively; (v) increases in certain costs\nof providing services to asylum seekers not\nincluded in the PEG of $604 million, $4.08\nbillion, $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively;\n(vi) a decrease reflecting reimbursements of\nCity expenditures with federal aid of $240\nmillion in fiscal year 2024 and an increase in\nin fiscal year 2025 City expenditures of $228\nmillion to cover costs previously expected to\nbe funded with federal aid; (vii) increases in\nlabor expenses of $33 million, $6 million, $7\nmillion and $7 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2027, respectively; (viii) decreases\nin pension contributions of $273 million, $43\nmillion, $84 million and $141 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively;\n(ix) decreases in debt service of $72 million,\n$63 million, $146 million and $210 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively;\n(x) a decrease in the general reserve of $1.15\nbillion in fiscal year 2024; (xi) a decrease\nin the capital stabilization reserve of $250\nmillion in fiscal year 2024; and (xii) a\ndecrease of $400 million in fiscal year 2024\nreflecting a re-estimate of prior years\u2019\nexpenses and receivables. The PEG savings\ndescribed above are based on five categories\nof initiatives designed to close the gap\nbetween expenses and revenues: (i) efficiency\ninitiatives designed to improve the City\u2019s\nfinances without reducing services; (ii)\nexpense re-estimates due to a delay in\nspending or lower than expected costs; (iii)\ngrant revenue re-estimates and increases in\nCity revenues; (iv) service reductions; and\n(v) reductions in debt service costs,\nprimarily as a result of debt refinancing. The\nFinancial Plan reflects, since the June\nFinancial Plan, provision of $3.78 billion for\nthe prepayment in fiscal year 2024 of fiscal\nyear 2025 expenses, resulting in an equivalent\nexpenditure reduction in fiscal year 2025. The\nFinancial Plan assumes total federal\ncategorical grants of $12.49 billion, $7.74\nbillion, $7.22 billion, $7.17 billion and\n$7.25 billion in fiscal years 2024 through\n2028, respectively. On October 7, 2022, the\nMayor declared a State of Emergency as a\nresult of the increase in arrival of asylum\nseekers, primarily from Central and South\nAmerica. The arrival of asylum seekers is\nplacing a strain on the City\u2019s resources. The\nfull costs to the City of providing services\nto asylum seekers during the Financial Plan\nperiod are not known at this time. The\nFinancial Plan reflects costs for asylum\nseeker services of $4.22 billion, $4.87\nbillion, $2.50 billion and $1.50 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively.\nUsing data available as of January 2024, the\nCity projects the cost of providing asylum\nseeker services are estimated to be $4.15\nbillion in fiscal year 2024 and $4.75 billion\nin fiscal year 2025, the last year for which\nthe City has projections. The Financial Plan\nreflects higher costs for asylum seeker\nservices in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 than\nthe City\u2019s current projections to account for\nthe possibility of higher costs and lower\nsavings than the asylum seeker PEG savings\ndescribed above. The costs for asylum seeker\nservices reflected in the Financial Plan\ninclude funding from a combination of State,\nCity, and federal sources. The Financial Plan\nreflects State funding for asylum seeker\nservices of $1.76 billion and $1.31 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively,\nwhich, in total, is approximately $400 million\nmore than would be available under the\nGovernor\u2019s Executive Budget for the State,\nreleased January 16, 2024 (the \u201c Governor\u2019s\nExecutive Budget \u201d ). The Financial Plan\nreflects $156 million in federal funds for\ncosts related to asylum seekers in fiscal year\n2024, with no federal funding reflected in\nfiscal years 2025 and beyond. The City\ncontinues to seek additional funding and other\nsupport from the State and the federal\ngovernment for costs incurred by the City\nrelated to the provision of services to asylum\nseekers. On\n\n46\n\nMarch 15, 2024, the City entered into a State\nSupreme Court approved stipulation with the\nLegal Aid Society (the \u201c Stipulation \u201d ),\nrevising the City\u2019s existing obligations to\nprovide housing to asylum seekers while the\nState of Emergency remains in effect, unless\notherwise ordered by the court. The\nStipulation gives the City more flexibility in\nits provision of shelter services to single\nadult asylum seekers including allowing the\nCity to limit the provision of shelter to\nsingle adults aged twenty-three years or older\nto 30 days, while allowing the City to limit\nthe provision of shelter to single adults\nunder the age of twenty-three to 60 days, each\nwith certain exceptions on a case-by-case\nbasis. Pending certain necessary changes to\nCity operations and processes, the City\nexpects to implement this thirty-day shelter\nlimitation for the eligible population. While\nthe City is still analyzing the potential\nimpact of implementing the changes permitted\npursuant to the Stipulation, the City expects\nsuch changes to reduce the projected asylum\nseeker costs described above. On September 9,\n2023, in response, in part, to the fiscal\nstrain caused by the influx of asylum seekers,\nthe City announced a series of PEG initiatives\nto achieve savings, including a freeze on\nhiring, other than critical positions required\nto support health, public safety and revenue\ngeneration, to be permitted only on the basis\nof one new hire for every one departure. The\nCity outlined a series of three PEG\ninitiatives to be achieved in the City\u2019s\nNovember Financial Plan, the Financial Plan\nand the City\u2019s financial plan to be released\nin April 2024 (the \u201c April Financial Plan \u201d ).\nThe PEG savings described above reflect the\nresults of the City\u2019s November Financial Plan\nand the Financial Plan. In addition, the Mayor\nissued two directives on September 14, 2023,\nimplementing overtime-reduction plans for the\nCity\u2019s four uniformed agencies (the Police,\nFire, Sanitation and Corrections Departments)\nand instituting a freeze on certain designated\nOther than Personal Services spending,\nincluding out of town travel (except to\nWashington D.C. or Albany), temporary service\ncontracts, consultant contracts, and contracts\nfor equipment and furnishings, with certain\nexemptions as approved by OMB and the Office\nof the First Deputy Mayor. On February 21,\n2024, in a letter to City agencies, the City\u2019s\nBudget Director announced that the City will\nno longer be implementing the third of the\nthree PEG initiatives outlined above, due to\nthe success of cost-savings achieved in the\nCity\u2019s November Financial Plan and the\nFinancial Plan and stronger than projected tax\nrevenues. However, due to ongoing concerns\nabout asylum-seeker related spending,\nparticularly in the fiscal years beyond 2025,\nthe last year for which the City has\nprojections, the City is taking steps to\nfurther reduce such costs in the April\nFinancial Plan. The City intends to reduce\nCity-funded asylum seeker costs by an\nadditional ten percent (10%) across fiscal\nyears 2024 and 2025, beyond those reflected in\nthe Financial Plan. Further, in March 2024,\nthe City replaced the hiring freeze outlined\nin September 2023 with a hiring plan which\nallows for the hiring of one employee for\nevery two departures, so long as the agencies\nremain within their budgeted headcount.\nCritical positions required to support health,\npublic safety and revenue generation will\ncontinue to be permitted on the basis of one\nnew hire for every one departure. Finally, the\nCity has eased the restrictions on Other than\nPersonal Services spending described above,\nwith agencies permitted to spend within their\nOther than Personal Services budgets. However,\nthe restrictions on travel, consultants, and\ncertain other expenditures will remain in\nplace, with certain exemptions as approved by\nOMB and the Office of the First Deputy Mayor.\nThe local law authorizing the City to sell\nreal property tax liens expired on March 1,\n2022. However, the City continues to seek\nreauthorization of such authority. The\nFinancial Plan assumes the re-authorization of\nsuch authority in fiscal year 2024 and assumes\ndirect revenues to the City from such lien\nsales of $80 million in each of fiscal years\n2024 through 2028. The Financial Plan further\nassumes that real property tax delinquencies\nas a percentage of the total property tax levy\nwill average approximately 2.5% in fiscal\nyears 2024 through 2028. There can be no\nassurance that the authorization to sell real\nproperty tax liens will be reinstated or that,\nas a result, amounts projected in the\nFinancial Plan to be received from such sales\nwill be realized. In the event that the lien\nsale program is not re-authorized, real\nproperty tax delinquencies are expected to\nincrease over time beyond the rates assumed in\nthe Financial Plan. Each 1% increase in\ndelinquencies would reduce property tax\nrevenues by approximately $353 million, $360\nmillion, $367 million, $378 million, and $384\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2028,\nrespectively. The City has reached tentative\nor ratified contract agreements with District\nCouncil 37 of AFSCME ( \u201c DC 37 \u201d ) the Police\nBenevolent Association ( \u201c PBA \u201d ), and\nothers, which, together represent\napproximately 95% of the City\u2019s unionized\nworkforce, the full cost of which is reflected\nin the Financial Plan. The Financial Plan also\nreflects the costs of labor settlements for\nthe rest of the City workforce based on the\npattern set by the DC 37 or the PBA framework.\nOn March 14, 2024, the City announced a 3%\nannual cost-of-living adjustment in each of\nfiscal years 2025, 2026 and 2027 for human\nservices workers employed by non-profit\norganizations with contracts with the City.\nThe cost of such increases, which is expected\nto be $741 million through Fiscal Year 2028,\nis reflected in the Financial Plan.\n\n47\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the City Council passed four\nbills that substantially expand eligibility\nfor the City\u2019s housing rental assistance\nvoucher program for individuals and families\nwho are experiencing or are at risk of\nhomelessness. The bills lift existing\neligibility requirements that applicants for\nvouchers reside or have resided in a City\nadministered shelter, expand income\neligibility from 200% of the federal poverty\nlevel to 50% of area median income, eliminate\nall work requirements for some households, and\nexpand eligibility to households that have\nreceived written demands for payment of past\nrent. The Mayor vetoed the bills on June 23,\n2023, noting fiscal, operational, policy and\nlegal issues presented by the legislation. The\nCity Council voted to override the vetoes on\nJuly 13, 2023. The resulting laws, comprised\nof Local Law Numbers 99, 100, 101 and 102 of\n2023, each took effect on January 9, 2024. The\nCity Commissioner of Social Services advised\nthe City Council, by letter dated December 15,\n2023, that in light of the issues identified\nin the Mayor\u2019s veto messages, the City would\nnot be implementing the local laws at that\ntime. The Legal Aid Society filed a lawsuit on\nFebruary 14, 2024 against the City on behalf\nof four individuals, seeking enforcement of\nthe local laws and asking the Court to order\nthe City to offer vouchers to the individual\npetitioners and all eligible applicants. On\nFebruary 21, 2024, the City Council moved to\nintervene in the Legal Aid Society\u2019s lawsuit,\nseeking to compel implementation of the local\nlaws. The Mayor disputes the merits of these\nclaims. However, if these laws are construed\nto require that each eligible individual and\nfamily be provided with a rental assistance\nvoucher, the Mayor estimates that they would\ncost the City approximately $17.0 billion over\nthe years of the Financial Plan. The full\nfiscal impact of implementing these laws in\nthis manner is not reflected in the Financial\nPlan. The State fiscal year 2024 budget ( \u201c\nState 2024 Budget \u201d ) included a requirement\nthat adoption, foster care, and related\nservice providers be compensated at 100% of\nmaximum State aid rates, which is expected to\ncost the City up to $118 million per fiscal\nyear. Such costs are reflected in the\nFinancial Plan for fiscal year 2024, but not\nreflected in the Financial Plan for fiscal\nyears 2025 through 2028. Based on current\nforecasts of both real property values and\nanticipated City capital needs, including\nadditional anticipated costs not reflected in\nthe Financial Plan, OMB projects that\nadditional debt-incurring capacity will be\nneeded in the years beyond the Financial Plan.\nSuch projected additional costs not reflected\nin the Financial Plan include additional\nfunding for the City\u2019s five-year educational\nfacilities capital plan, the construction of\nnew borough-based jail facilities and\nreconstruction work on the Brooklyn Queens\nExpressway. The Governor\u2019s Executive Budget\nincludes a proposal which if enacted would\nincrease the total amount of New York City\nTransitional Finance Authority ( \u201c TFA \u201d )\nFuture Tax Secured Bonds authorized to be\noutstanding and not subject to the City\u2019s debt\nlimit by a total of $12 billion, from $13.5\nbillion to $25.5 billion, with $6 billion of\nsuch increased capacity available beginning on\nJuly 1, 2024 and the remaining $6 billion\navailable beginning on July 1, 2025. As an\nalternative to the Governor\u2019s proposal, the\nMayor is seeking legislation that would\nincrease the total amount of Future Tax\nSecured Bonds authorized to be outstanding and\nnot subject to the City\u2019s debt limit by a\ntotal of $18.5 billion, from $13.5 billion to\n$32 billion, with additional annual percentage\nincreases equal to annual percentage\nincreases, if any, in personal income tax\nrevenues. The resulting impact of increasing\nthe TFA\u2019s debt incurring capacity not subject\nto the City\u2019s debt limit would be to increase\nthe combined TFA and City debt-incurring\ncapacity by such corresponding amount. The\nGovernor\u2019s Executive Budget, includes\nproposals which, if enacted, are projected to\nhave a total cost to the City of approximately\n$77.5 million in fiscal year 2025, $191.3\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027\nand $153.8 million in fiscal year 2028,\nrespectively. Such proposed costs, which are\nnot reflected in the Financial Plan, include:\n(i) the extension through March 31, 2028 of\nthe intercept by the State of sales tax\nrevenues otherwise payable to the City to\nprovide assistance to distressed hospitals and\nnursing homes beyond its current expiration of\nMarch 31, 2025, which is estimated to reduce\nsales tax revenues to the City in the amount\nof $37.5 million in fiscal year 2025, $150\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027\nand $112.5 million in fiscal year 2028; (ii) a\nrequirement for employers to provide 20 minute\npaid leave for breast milk expression, which\nwould result in increased costs to the City of\napproximately $35 million in each of fiscal\nyears 2025 through 2028; (iii) the redirection\nof federal funding to the State to help pay\nfor services for children and families, which\nis estimated to cost the City $5.10 million in\neach of fiscal years 2025 through 2028; and\n(iv) the elimination of copays for insulin\nwhich is estimated to cost the City $1.2\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2025 through\n2028. The State budget for State fiscal year\n2024-2025 is expected to be adopted on or\nabout April 1, 2024. The Governor\u2019s Executive\nBudget is a proposal and there can be no\nassurance that any legislation described in\nthe preceding paragraphs will be enacted as\ncurrently proposed, or that the State\nLegislature will not make changes that have an\nadverse impact on the City\u2019s Financial Plan\nprojections. The State 2021 Budget included a\nrequirement that the City increase its funding\nof the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s\n( \u201c MTA \u201d ) net paratransit operating deficit\nfrom 33% to 50%. The State 2024 Budget further\nrequired the City to increase its funding in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2025 from 50% to the\nlower of 80% of the deficit or 50% of the\ndeficit plus $165\n\n48\n\nmillion. The City\u2019s Financial Plan reflects\n$440 million in fiscal year 2024, $340 million\nin fiscal year 2025, and $175 million in each\nof fiscal years 2026 through 2028 to cover the\nCity\u2019s contributions for paratransit services,\ncompared to the MTA\u2019s November 2023 financial\nplan estimates of $434 million, $437 million,\n$453 million, $469 million, and $480 million\nin fiscal years 2024 through 2028,\nrespectively. Although the State 2024 Budget\nonly mandated the above described increases\nfor fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the MTA\u2019s\nfinancial plan assumes City funding for\nparatransit in fiscal year 2026 and beyond\nwill remain at such increased levels. The City\nwill continue to monitor the anticipated\nparatransit costs for future years. The\nFinancial Plan does not fully reflect likely\nfuture costs for legally mandated tuition for\nspecial education students unilaterally placed\nby their families in private school settings\nor for other privately provided services for\nspecial education students in private school\nsettings. The City is closely monitoring these\ncosts and while the amounts are not currently\nknown, they are likely to be significant. The\nFinancial Plan does not reflect the impact of\na State law enacted in 2022 which mandates\ncertain maximum class sizes in public school\nkindergarten through twelfth grades, to be\nphased in over five years. It is estimated\nthat the City will be able to meet this\nobligation without additional funding in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2025, but compliance may\ncost up to $1.9 billion per fiscal year when\nthe requirement is fully phased in. On January\n31, 2019, the New York City Housing Authority\n( \u201c NYCHA \u201d ), the City and the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (\n\u201c HUD \u201d ) entered into an agreement (the \u201c HUD\nAgreement \u201d ) relating to lead-based paint and\nother health and safety concerns in NYCHA\u2019s\nproperties. The HUD Agreement established a\nframework by which NYCHA will continue to\nevaluate and progress towards compliance with\nfederal requirements. Pursuant to the HUD\nAgreement, a federal monitor, with access to\nNYCHA information and personnel, has been\nappointed to oversee NYCHA\u2019s compliance with\nthe terms of the agreement and federal\nregulations. The federal monitor has issued\nand will continue to issue quarterly reports\non NYCHA\u2019s compliance with the HUD Agreement.\nAlso pursuant to the HUD Agreement, the City\nallocated $1.8 billion in capital funding in\nthe Capital Commitment Plan for fiscal years\n2024-2028, with an additional $1.5 billion in\nCity capital funds reflected in the remaining\nyears of the Ten-Year Capital Strategy for\nfiscal years 2029 through 2033. In addition to\nthe capital available pursuant to the HUD\nAgreement, the Ten-Year Capital Strategy\nreflects $1.3 billion in additional City\ncapital to NYCHA in fiscal years 2024 through\n2033. NYCHA subsequently announced that it may\nbe out of compliance with a number of federal\nregulations beyond the regulations concerning\nlead-based paint and other health and safety\nconcerns that were the subject of the HUD\nAgreement and is working to assess the extent\nof any such noncompliance. A NYCHA Physical\nNeeds Assessment released in July 2023\nestimated its projected capital costs at\napproximately $60 billion over the next five\nyears and $78 billion over the next twenty\nyears. As part of NYCHA\u2019s strategy to fund\nthese repairs, NYCHA plans to recapitalize\n62,000 units through the Permanent\nAffordability Commitment Together ( \u201c PACT \u201d )\nprogram and 25,000 units through the New York\nCity Housing Preservation Trust (the \u201c Housing\nPreservation Trust \u201d ). The Capital Commitment\nPlan reflects a total of $1.4 billion of City\ncapital funding towards the PACT program, with\nan additional $100 million of City capital\nspent in fiscal year 2023. The Housing\nPreservation Trust is not funded by the City\nand is not reflected in the Financial Plan.\nNYCHA\u2019s rent collection rate, which has\nhistorically been approximately 90%, is\ncurrently approximately 60%. As a result,\nNYCHA is projecting a substantial reduction in\nrent revenues in calendar year 2024. This\nreduction in NYCHA\u2019s revenues has required\nthat NYCHA rely on its reserves to cover\nexpenses, eliminate budgeted vacancies, reduce\nstaff through attrition, and reduce\nnonessential contracting. While this projected\nshortfall does not directly impact the City\u2019s\nbudget, if NYCHA\u2019s revenues do not recover,\nthe City could be asked to increase its\nfunding to NYCHA. To address the significant\narrears, NYCHA has received approximately $100\nmillion in funding for the Emergency Rental\nAssistance Program ( \u201c ERAP \u201d ) from the\nState, which provides funds for eligible\nhouseholds to pay rental and utility arrears\naccumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In\ntotal, NYCHA expects to receive $164 million\nfrom ERAP. Additionally, on January 5, 2024,\nHUD approved the City\u2019s HOME American Rescue\nPlan Allocation where $150 million was\nallocated towards NYCHA tenant arrears. State\nlegislation provides for congestion tolling\nfor vehicles entering a designated congestion\nzone in Manhattan below 60th Street, the\nrevenues from which will be directed to the\nMTA for transit improvements. In June 2023,\nthe federal government provided final approval\nto move forward with congestion pricing and in\nDecember 2023 the Traffic Mobility Review\nBoard provided a recommended toll structure.\nThe MTA concluded a final round of public\nhearings in March 2024. In July 2023, the\nstate of New Jersey filed a lawsuit\nchallenging the federal government\u2019s approval\nof the congestion pricing plan. Other parties,\nincluding the Staten Island Borough President\nand the United Federation of Teachers, have\nalso sued to block congestion pricing,\ndelaying program implementation. These\nlawsuits are ongoing.\n\n49\n\nThe New York City Advisory Commission on\nProperty Tax Reform was established in 2018 to\nconsider changes to the City\u2019s property\ntaxation system, without reducing property tax\nrevenues to the City. The commission released\nits report in December 2021 with\nrecommendations which, among other things,\nwould align the taxable value of certain\nproperties more closely with market value. The\ncommission\u2019s recommendations, which have not\nyet been acted upon, would require State\nlegislation if they were to be implemented.\nFrom time to time, the City Comptroller, the\nControl Board staff, the Office of the State\nDeputy Comptroller for the City of New York (\n\u201c OSDC \u201d ), the Independent Budget Office ( \u201c\nIBO \u201d ) and others issue reports and make\npublic statements regarding the City\u2019s\nfinancial condition, commenting on, among\nother matters, the City\u2019s financial plans,\nprojected revenues and expenditures and\nactions by the City to eliminate projected\noperating deficits. It is reasonable to expect\nthat reports and statements will continue to\nbe issued and may contain different\nperspectives on the City\u2019s budget and economy\nand may engender public comment. Assumptions.\nThe Financial Plan is based on numerous\nassumptions, including the condition of the\nCity\u2019s and the region\u2019s economies and the\nconcomitant receipt of economically sensitive\ntax revenues in the amounts projected. As\nshown in the Forecast of Key Economic\nIndicators below, the Financial Plan assumes\nno economic recession during the years of the\nFinancial Plan. The Financial Plan is subject\nto various other uncertainties and\ncontingencies relating to, among other\nfactors, the extent, if any, to which wage\nincreases for City employees exceed the annual\nwage costs assumed; realization of projected\nearnings for pension fund assets and current\nassumptions with respect to wages for City\nemployees affecting the City\u2019s required\npension fund contributions; the willingness\nand ability of the State to provide the aid\ncontemplated by the Financial Plan and to take\nvarious other actions to assist the City; the\nability of NYCHH and other such entities to\nmaintain balanced budgets; the willingness of\nthe federal government to provide the amount\nof federal aid contemplated in the Financial\nPlan; the impact on City revenues and\nexpenditures of federal and State legislation\naffecting Medicare or other entitlement\nprograms; adoption of the City\u2019s budgets by\nthe City Council in substantially the forms\nsubmitted by the Mayor; the ability of the\nCity to implement cost reduction initiatives,\nand the success with which the City controls\nexpenditures; the impact of conditions in the\nreal estate market on real estate tax\nrevenues; the ability of the City and other\nfinancing entities to market their securities\nsuccessfully in the public credit markets; the\nimpact of the outbreak of COVID-19; and the\nextension of the authorization to sell real\nproperty tax liens. Certain of these\nassumptions are reviewed in reports issued by\nthe City Comptroller and other public\nofficials. See \u201c Certain Reports \u201d herein. The\nprojections and assumptions contained in the\nFinancial Plan are subject to revision, which\nmay be substantial. No assurance can be given\nthat these estimates and projections, which\ninclude actions the City expects will be taken\nbut are not within the City\u2019s control, will be\nrealized. Revenue Assumptions Real Estate Tax\n. Projections of real estate tax revenues are\nbased on a number of assumptions, including,\namong others, assumptions relating to the tax\nrate, the assessed valuation of the City\u2019s\ntaxable real estate, the delinquency rate,\ndebt service needs, a reserve for\nuncollectible taxes, and the operating limit.\nProjections of real estate tax revenues\ninclude net revenues from the sale of real\nproperty tax liens of $80 million in each of\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, however, the\nlocal law authorizing the City to sell real\nproperty tax liens expired on March 1, 2022.\nThe City continues to seek the re-\nauthorization of such authority. Projections\nof real estate tax revenues include the\neffects of the STAR Program which will reduce\nthe real estate tax revenues by an estimated\n$128 million , $126 million, $124 million,\n$122 million and $120 million in fiscal years\n2024 through 2028, respectively. Projections\nof real estate tax revenues reflect the\nestimated cost of extending the current tax\nreduction for owners of cooperative and\ncondominium apartments amounting to $663\nmillion, $663 million, $670 million, $687\nmillion and $700 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively. The delinquency\nrate was 1.2% in fiscal year 2019, 1.8% in\nfiscal year 2020, 2.0% in fiscal year 2021,\n1.8% in fiscal year 2022 and 2.1% in fiscal\nyear 2023. The Financial Plan projects\ndelinquency rates averaging 2.5% from fiscal\nyears 2024 through 2028. On April 24, 2017, a\nlawsuit was filed challenging the City\u2019s real\nproperty tax system and valuation methodology.\nThe action alleges that the City\u2019s real\nproperty tax system violates the State and\nfederal constitutions as well as the Fair\nHousing Act. The action further alleges the\nvaluation methodology as mandated by certain\nprovisions of the State Real Property Tax Law\nresults in a disparity and inequality in the\namount of taxes paid by certain minority\nproperty owners and renters. The City and\n\n50\n\nState defendants moved to dismiss the case. In\nSeptember 2018, the Court denied the City\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the complaint and partially\ngranted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. The City and State both appealed\nthe lower court decision, and the City made a\nmotion before the trial court for a\ndeclaration that a statutory stay of the lower\ncourt proceeding was in effect by virtue of\nits filing the Notice of Appeal, or in the\nalternative, for a discretionary stay of all\nproceedings pending the appeal. The stay was\ngranted. All parties appealed the lower court\ndecision on the motion to dismiss, and after\nbriefing and argument, the First Department\ngranted the City\u2019s and the State\u2019s motions to\ndismiss and dismissed all claims against both\nthe City and the State. In September 2020, the\nNew York Court of Appeals dismissed the\nplaintiff\u2019s purported appeal as of right of\nthe First Department ruling. On August 9,\n2021, the plaintiff filed, in the Appellate\nDivision, a motion for leave to appeal and on\nAugust 20, 2021, the City filed a response in\nopposition thereto. The Appellate Division\ndenied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to\nappeal to the Court of Appeals. On December 1,\n2021, the plaintiff served and filed a motion\nseeking leave to appeal directly from the\nCourt of Appeals. On April 28, 2022, the Court\nof Appeals granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for\nleave to appeal. Oral argument was held at the\nCourt of Appeals on January 9, 2024. A\ndecision was issued on March 19, 2024, in\nwhich the Court of Appeals reversed the\ndecision of the Appellate Division in part.\nThe court held that the petitioner\nsufficiently alleged causes of action against\nthe City under section 305 (2) of the State\nReal Property Tax Law and the Fair Housing Act\nand denied the portions of the City\u2019s motion\nto dismiss relating to those claims. The court\naffirmed the Appellate Division decision with\nregard to all other claims brought against the\nCity and the State. The open claims are now\npermitted to proceed in New York State Supreme\nCourt. Other Taxes . The Financial Plan\nreflects the following assumptions regarding\nprojected baseline revenues from Other Taxes:\n(i) with respect to the personal income tax,\nincreases in fiscal year 2024 due to strong\nwithholding income and flat non-wage income,\nand increases in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028 as overall historical levels of revenue\nresume; (ii) with respect to the business\ncorporation tax, increases in revenue in\nfiscal year 2024 reflecting continued strength\nin both finance and non-finance sectors, but\nplateauing after several years of exceptional\ngrowth, continued increases in fiscal years\n2025 through 2028, reflecting a return to\nhistorical levels of revenue growth; (iii)\nwith respect to the unincorporated business\nincome tax, a smaller growth in fiscal year\n2024 reflecting a weaker Wall Street\nperformance, with weaker growth in fiscal year\n2025 reflecting slower economic growth and a\nreturn to moderate growth in fiscal years 2026\nthrough 2028; (iv) with respect to the sales\ntax, growth is expected to be moderate in\nfiscal year 2024 as consumer spending and\ntourism growth eases, with growth improving\nmodestly in fiscal years 2025 through 2028\nreflecting a stable economy; (v) with respect\nto the real property transfer tax, a decline\nin fiscal year 2024 from the continued slow-\ndown in residential activity reflecting the\nimpact of rising interest rates and stalled\ncommercial transactions, with growth in fiscal\nyears 2025 through 2028 reflecting a recovery\nas interest rates decline; (vi) with respect\nto the mortgage recording tax, declines in\nfiscal year 2024 as the impact from the higher\ninterest rates continues to reverberate\nthrough the residential and commercial markets\nbefore growth in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028, reflecting a decline in mortgage rates;\nand (vii) with respect to the commercial rent\ntax, a flat fiscal year 2024 reflecting high\nvacancy rates for commercial office space in\nManhattan and slow growth from fiscal years\n2025 through 2028, as uncertainties remain\nabout office space use. Miscellaneous\nRevenues. The Financial Plan reflects\ncollections from Miscellaneous Revenues in the\namounts of approximately $8.6 billion in\nfiscal year 2024, $8.1 billion in fiscal year\n2025, $7.7 billion in fiscal year 2026 and\n$7.6 billion in each of fiscal years 2027 and\n2028. Intergovernmental Aid . The Financial\nPlan assumes that all existing federal and\nState categorical grant programs will\ncontinue, unless specific legislation provides\nfor their termination or adjustment, and\nassumes increases in aid where increased costs\nare projected for existing grant programs. As\nof December 31, 2023, approximately 17.4% of\nthe City\u2019s full-time and full-time equivalent\nemployees (consisting of employees of the\nmayoral agencies and the DOE) were paid by\nCommunity Development funds, water and sewer\nfunds and from other sources not funded by\nunrestricted revenues of the City. A major\ncomponent of federal categorical aid to the\nCity is the Community Development program.\nPursuant to federal legislation, Community\nDevelopment grants are provided to cities\nprimarily to aid low and moderate income\npersons by improving housing facilities, parks\nand other improvements, by providing certain\nsocial programs and by promoting economic\ndevelopment. These grants are based on a\nformula that takes into consideration such\nfactors as population, age of housing and\npoverty. The City\u2019s receipt of categorical aid\nis contingent upon the satisfaction of certain\nstatutory conditions and is subject to\nsubsequent audits, possible disallowances and\npossible prior claims by the State or federal\ngovernments. The general\n\n51\n\npractice of the State and federal governments\nhas been to deduct the amount of any\ndisallowances against the current year\u2019s\npayment, although in some cases the City\nremits payment for disallowed amounts to the\ngrantor. Substantial disallowances of aid\nclaims may be asserted during the course of\nthe Financial Plan. The City estimates\nprobable amounts of disallowances of\nrecognized grant revenues and makes the\nappropriate adjustments to recognized grant\nrevenue for each fiscal year. The amounts of\nsuch downward adjustments to revenue for\ndisallowances attributable to prior years\nincreased from $124 million in the 1977 fiscal\nyear to $542 million in the 2006 fiscal year.\nThe amounts of such disallowances were $103\nmillion and $114 million in fiscal years 2007\nand 2008, respectively. There were no\nadjustments for estimated disallowances in\nfiscal years 2009 and 2010. In fiscal year\n2011, the downward adjustment for\ndisallowances was $113 million and in fiscal\nyear 2012 an upward adjustment of $166 million\nwas made, reflecting a reduced estimate of\ndisallowances attributable to prior years as\nof June 30, 2012. In fiscal years 2013, 2014,\n2015, 2016, 2020 and 2021, downward\nadjustments of $59 million, $19 million, $110\nmillion, $1 million, $5 million and $24\nmillion, respectively, were made. In fiscal\nyears 2017, 2018 and 2019, upward adjustments\nof $558 million, $139 million and $113\nmillion, respectively, were made. In fiscal\nyear 2022, a downward adjustment of $35\nmillion was made. In fiscal year 2023, a\ndownward adjustment of $13 million was made.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the City had an\naccumulated reserve of $331 million for all\ndisallowances of categorical aid. Expenditure\nAssumptions Personal Service Costs . The\nFinancial Plan projects that the authorized\nnumber of City-funded full-time and full-time\nequivalent employees will decrease from an\nestimated level of 265,955 as of June 30, 2024\nto an estimated level of 265,796 by June 30,\n2028. Other Fringe Benefits includes $3.429\nbillion, $3.595 billion, $3.755 billion,\n$3.914 billion and $4.090 billion in fiscal\nyears 2024 through 2028, respectively, for\npost-employment benefits other than pensions (\n\u201c OPEB \u201d ) expenditures for current retirees,\nwhich costs are currently paid by the City on\na pay-as-you-go basis. The City has reached\ntentative or ratified contract agreements with\nDC 37, the PBA and others, which, together\nrepresent approximately 95% of the City\u2019s\nunionized workforce, the full cost of which is\nreflected in the Financial Plan. The Financial\nPlan also reflects the costs of labor\nsettlements for the rest of the City workforce\nbased on the pattern set by the DC 37 or the\nPBA framework. The respective pattern\nframework provides raises totaling 16.21% for\ncivilian workers and 18.98% for uniformed\nworkers over a 60-month contract term. On July\n31, 2023, an arbitration decision awarded\nnurses employed by NYCHH and represented by\nthe New York State Nurses Association with\nsubstantial pay increases over a five-and-a-\nhalf-year term, in excess of the DC 37\npattern. Such increased costs, which the City\nestimates will be approximately $744 million\nthrough fiscal year 2028, are not reflected in\nthe Financial Plan. Such costs are expected to\nbe funded by NYCHH. Other Than Personal\nServices ( \u201c OTPS \u201d ). Administrative OTPS and\nEnergy. The Financial Plan contains estimates\nof the City\u2019s administrative OTPS expenditures\nfor general supplies and materials, equipment\nand selected contractual services, and the\nimpact of agency gap-closing actions relating\nto such expenditures in the 2024 fiscal year.\nEnergy costs for each of the 2024 through 2028\nfiscal years are assumed to vary annually,\nwith total energy expenditures projected at\n$1.22 billion in fiscal year 2024 and\nincreasing to $1.41 billion by fiscal year\n2028. Public Assistance. Of total cash\nassistance expenditures in the City, the City-\nfunded portion is projected to be $974 million\nin fiscal year 2024, $875 million in each of\nfiscal years 2025 and 2026, $1.2 billion in\nfiscal year 2027 and $1.5 billion in fiscal\nyear 2028. Medical Assistance. Medical\nassistance payments projected in the Financial\nPlan consist of payments to voluntary\nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities,\nintermediate care facilities, home care\nproviders, pharmacies, managed care\norganizations, physicians and other medical\npractitioners. The City-funded portion of\nmedical assistance payments is expected to be\n$6.5 billion in fiscal year 2024, $6.4 billion\nin fiscal year 2025, $6.5 billion in fiscal\nyear 2026, $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2027\nand $6.8 billion in fiscal year 2028. Such\npayments include the City\u2019s capped share of\nlocal Medicaid expenditures as well as\nSupplemental Medicaid payments to NYCHH.\n\n52\n\nNew York City Health and Hospitals. NYCHH,\nwhich provides essential services to over 1.1\nmillion New Yorkers annually, faces near- and\nlong-term financial challenges resulting from,\namong other things, changes in hospital\nreimbursement under the Affordable Care Act\nand the statewide transition to managed care.\nOn April 26, 2016, the City released \u201c One New\nYork: Health Care for Our Neighborhoods, \u201d a\nreport outlining the City\u2019s plan to address\nNYCHH\u2019s financial shortfall. In February 2024,\nNYCHH released a cash-based financial plan,\nwhich projected City-funded expenditures of\n$3.0 billion in fiscal year 2024, $3.1 billion\nin fiscal year 2025, $1.3 billion in fiscal\nyear 2026 and $1.4 billion in each of fiscal\nyears 2027 and 2028, in addition to the\nforgiveness of debt service for fiscal years\n2024 through 2028 and the City\u2019s contribution\nto supplemental Medicaid payments which is\nconsistent with the City\u2019s Financial Plan.\nNYCHH\u2019s financial plan projected total\nreceipts of $12.1 billion, $11.7 billion,\n$10.0 billion, $10.0 billion and $10.0\nbillion, and total disbursements of $12.0\nbillion, $11.8 billion, $10.1 billion, $10.2\nbillion and $10.5 billion in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively. NYCHH relies on\nsignificant projected revenue from Medicaid,\nMedicare and other third-party payor programs.\nFuture changes to such programs could have\nadverse impacts on NYCHH\u2019s financial\ncondition. Other. The projections set forth in\nthe Financial Plan for OTPS-Other include the\nCity\u2019s contributions to New York City Transit\n( \u201c NYCT \u201d ), NYCHA and the City University of\nNew York ( \u201c CUNY \u201d ) and subsidies to\nlibraries and various cultural institutions.\nThey also include projections for the cost of\nfuture judgments and claims, which are\ndiscussed below under \u201c Judgments and Claims.\n\u201d In the past, the City has provided\nadditional assistance to certain State\ngovernmental agencies, public authorities or\npublic benefit corporations which receive or\nmay receive monies from the City directly,\nindirectly or contingently ( \u201c Covered\nOrganizations \u201d ) which had exhausted their\nfinancial resources prior to the end of the\nfiscal year. No assurance can be given that\nsimilar additional assistance will not be\nrequired in the future. New York City Transit.\nNYCT operates under its own section of the\nFinancial Plan as a Covered Organization. An\naccrual-based financial plan for NYCT covering\nits 2024 through 2027 fiscal years was\npublished in November 2023 (the \u201c 2024 NYCT\nFinancial Plan \u201d ). The NYCT fiscal year\ncoincides with the calendar year. The 2024\nNYCT Financial Plan reflects the negative\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on MTA costs,\nridership, and farebox revenue. The 2024 NYCT\nFinancial Plan reflects City assistance to the\nNYCT operating budget of $650 million in 2024,\nincreasing to $697 million in 2027. In\naddition, the 2024 NYCT Financial Plan\nprojects real estate transfer tax revenue\ndedicated for NYCT use of $546.1 million in\n2024, higher than 2023\u2019s $416 million; that\namount increases each year to reach $618\nmillion by 2027. The 2024 NYCT Financial Plan\nreflects $12.3 billion in revenues and $15.4\nbillion in expenses for 2024, leaving a budget\ngap of $3.1 billion. After accounting for\naccrual adjustments and cash carried over from\n2023 there is a projected operating surplus of\n$7.3 million in 2024, followed by projected\noperating budget gaps of $409 million in 2025,\n$812 million in 2026, and $1.8 billion in\n2027. In 2009, a Payroll Mobility Tax ( \u201c PMT\n\u201d ) was enacted into State law to provide\n$0.34 for every $100 of payroll in the MTA\u2019s\ntwelve-county service area. This contribution\nwas increased to $0.60 for every $100 of\npayroll in New York City in the 2024 State\nBudget. The PMT is currently expected to\ngenerate revenues for NYCT in the amount of\n$1.7 billion in 2024, decreasing to $1.3\nbillion in 2027. The MTA has been able to\ncorrect the serious budget shortfalls\nreflected in recent financial plans through\nthe receipt of one-time direct State aid, a\nState-mandated increase to the City\u2019s share of\nparatransit costs, and the implementation of\nnew taxes, fare and toll increases, and\noperational efficiencies. The City\u2019s payments\nto the MTA remain dependent on future\nuncertainties such as additional state or\nfederal funding, ridership trends, and service\nadjustments. The 2015-2019 Capital Program\ncurrently includes $33.9 billion for all MTA\nagencies, including $16.7 billion to be\ninvested in the NYCT core system and $1.7\nbillion for NYCT network expansion. The State\nhas agreed to contribute $9.1 billion towards\nthe 2015-2019 Capital Program. The City has\nagreed to contribute $2.7 billion. Of the\nCity\u2019s contribution, $2.1 billion has been\nreflected in the City\u2019s Capital Commitment\nPlan, including $164 million for the Subway\nAction Plan. The remaining $600 million will\ncome from joint ventures, such as development\ndeals, which will not flow through the City\nbudget. On September 19, 2019, the MTA\nreleased its 2020-2024 Capital Program, which\ntook effect by default in January 2020. After\namendment, the program includes $55.4 billion\nfor all MTA agencies, including $34.6 billion\nto be invested in the NYCT core system and\n$4.6 billion in NYCT network expansion. The\nentire 2020-2024 Capital Program was placed on\nhold in 2020 but resumed upon the announcement\nof $6.5 billion in federal aid in the American\nRescue Plan Act in March of 2021. The\n\n53\n\nprogram was amended three times from its\noriginal $54.8 billion total, once in December\n2021, once in July 2022, and most recently in\nJuly 2023. Legislation adopted in 2019\nincludes the enactment of congestion tolling\nfor vehicles entering a designated congestion\nzone in Manhattan below 60th Street, the\nrevenues from which will be directed to the\nMTA for transit improvements. In late 2023 the\nTraffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB)\nrecommended a specific tolling scheme and in\nMarch 2024 the MTA concluded a final round of\npublic hearings. The 2024 NYCT Financial Plan\nanticipates that the MTA will begin receiving\nrevenue from congestion tolling in the middle\nof 2024, with an expectation of $400 million\nof revenue in 2024 and $1 billion annually\nthereafter. In July 2023, the state of New\nJersey filed a lawsuit challenging the federal\ngovernment\u2019s approval of the congestion\npricing plan. Other parties, including the\nStaten Island Borough President and the United\nFederation of Teachers, have also sued to\nblock congestion pricing, delaying program\nimplementation. In addition, the State 2020\nBudget included legislation authorizing the\nimposition of sales tax on certain additional\ninternet sales and providing that City sales\ntax revenues in the amount of $128 million in\nState fiscal year 2020 (reflecting the portion\nof the year in which it is effective) and $170\nmillion in State fiscal year 2021 and\nthereafter increasing by one percent per year,\nwill be directed to the MTA for transit\nimprovements. Revenues from such additional\nsales tax are currently estimated to be\napproximately $170 million per year and are in\naddition to existing sales taxes attributable\nto certain other internet transactions.\nAdditionally, such legislation provided that\nState sales tax revenues in the amount of $113\nmillion in State fiscal year 2020 and $150\nmillion in State fiscal year 2021 and\nthereafter increasing by one percent per year,\nwill be directed to the MTA for transit\nimprovements. The State 2020 Budget also\nincluded legislation increasing real estate\ntransfer taxes on properties valued at more\nthan $2 million, which will also be directed\nto the MTA for transit improvements. The State\n2021 Budget requires the City to contribute $3\nbillion towards the 2020-2024 Capital Program\nconcurrent with the State\u2019s $3 billion\ncontribution. Neither the City nor the State\ncan use operating funds dedicated to the MTA\nto supplant their capital commitment and must\npay on a schedule determined by the State\nBudget Director. The City has appropriated\nthis $3 billion, and this is anticipated to be\nspent within the Ten-Year Capital Strategy.\nThe State 2021 Budget included a requirement\nthat the City increase its funding of the\nMTA\u2019s net paratransit operating deficit from\n33% to 50%. The State 2024 Budget further\nrequires the City to increase its funding in\nCity fiscal years 2024 and 2025 from 50% to\nthe lower of 80% of the deficit or 50% of the\ndeficit plus $165 million. The City\u2019s\nFinancial Plan reflects $440 million in fiscal\nyear 2024, $340 million in fiscal year 2025,\nand $175 million in each of fiscal years 2026\nthrough 2028 to cover the City\u2019s contributions\nfor paratransit services, compared to MTA\u2019s\nestimates of $434 million, $437 million, $453\nmillion, $469 million, and $480 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively.\nThe MTA\u2019s estimate assumes that the State will\nrenew the increased contribution rate for the\nCity after fiscal year 2025. The City will\ncontinue to monitor anticipated paratransit\ncosts for future years. Department of\nEducation. State law requires the City to\nprovide City funds for the Department of\nEducation ( \u201c DOE \u201d ) each year in an amount\nnot less than the amount appropriated for the\npreceding fiscal year, excluding amounts for\ndebt service and pensions for the DOE. Such\nCity funding must be maintained, unless total\nCity funds for the fiscal year are estimated\nto be lower than in the preceding fiscal year,\nin which case the mandated City funding for\nthe DOE may be reduced by an amount up to the\npercentage reduction in total City funds.\nJudgments and Claims. In the fiscal year ended\non June 30, 2023, the City expended $1.2\nbillion for judgments and claims, the same\namount expended in the fiscal year ended June\n30, 2022. Such expenses reflect, in part,\npayments made relating to a class action\nlawsuit against the Board of Education. The\nFinancial Plan includes provisions for\njudgments and claims of $1.2 billion, $877.2\nmillion, $823.2 million, $840.2 million, and\n$862.5 million for the 2024 through 2028\nfiscal years, respectively. These projections\nincorporate a substantial amount of claims\ncosts attributed to NYCHH, estimated to be\n$140 million in each year of the Financial\nPlan, for which NYCHH reimburses the City\nunless otherwise forgiven by the City, which\nwas the case in fiscal years 2013 and 2016.\nThe City is a party to numerous lawsuits and\nis the subject of numerous claims and\ninvestigations. The City has estimated that\nits potential future liability on account of\noutstanding claims against it, as of June 30,\n2023, amounted to approximately $8.2 billion.\nThis estimate was made by categorizing the\nvarious claims and applying a statistical\nmodel, based primarily on actual settlements\nby type of claim during the preceding ten\nfiscal years, and by supplementing the\nestimated liability with information supplied\nby the City\u2019s Corporation Counsel. In addition\nto the above claims, numerous real estate tax\ncertiorari proceedings involving allegations\nof inequality of assessment, illegality and\novervaluation are currently pending against\nthe City. The City\u2019s Financial Statements for\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 include an\nestimate that the City\u2019s liability in the\ncertiorari proceedings, as of June 30, 2023,\ncould\n\n54\n\namount to approximately $1.47 billion.\nProvision has been made in the Financial Plan\nfor estimated refunds of $500 million in\nfiscal year 2024 and $400 million in each of\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028. General\nObligation, Lease and TFA Debt Service. Debt\nservice estimates for fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028 include debt service on\noutstanding general obligation bonds and\nconduit debt, the funding requirements\nassociated with outstanding TFA Future Tax\nSecured Bonds, and estimates of debt service\ncosts of, or funding requirements associated\nwith, future general obligation, conduit and\nTFA Future Tax Secured debt issuances based on\nprojected future market conditions. Such debt\nservice estimates also include estimated\npayments pursuant to interest rate exchange\nagreements but do not reflect receipts\npursuant to such agreements. In July 2009, the\nState amended the New York City Transitional\nFinance Authority Act to expand the borrowing\ncapacity of the TFA by providing that it may\nhave outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax\nSecured Bonds and may issue additional Future\nTax Secured Bonds provided that the amount of\nsuch additional bonds, together with the\namount of indebtedness contracted by the City,\ndoes not exceed the debt limit of the City.\nThe Governor\u2019s Executive Budget includes a\nproposal which, if enacted, would increase the\ntotal amount of TFA Future Tax Secured Bonds\nauthorized to be outstanding and not subject\nto the City\u2019s debt limit by a total of $12\nbillion, from $13.5 billion to $25.5 billion,\nwith $6 billion of such increased capacity\navailable beginning on July 1, 2024, and the\nremaining $6 billion available beginning on\nJuly 1, 2025. As an alternative to the\nGovernor\u2019s proposal, the Mayor is seeking\nlegislation that would increase the total\namount of Future Tax Secured Bonds authorized\nto be outstanding and not subject to the\nCity\u2019s debt limit by a total of $18.5 billion,\nfrom $13.5 billion to $32 billion, with\nadditional annual percentage increases equal\nto annual percentage increases, if any, in\npersonal income tax revenues. The resulting\nimpact of increasing the TFA\u2019s debt incurring\ncapacity not subject to the City\u2019s debt limit\nwould be to increase the combined TFA and City\ndebt-incurring capacity by such corresponding\namount. The City currently expects to continue\nto finance approximately half of its capital\nprogram through the TFA, exclusive of\nDepartment of Environmental Protection capital\nbudget items financed by the Water Authority.\nThe Financial Plan reflects general obligation\ndebt service of $4.31 billion, $4.50 billion,\n$4.72 billion, $4.89 billion and $5.25 billion\nin fiscal years 2024 through 2028,\nrespectively, conduit debt service of $121\nmillion, $120 million, $119 million, $118\nmillion and $112 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively, and TFA debt\nservice of $3.23 billion, $3.56 billion, $4.02\nbillion, $4.48 billion and $4.91 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively,\nin each case prior to giving effect to\nprepayments. Such debt service requirements\nare projected to be below 15% of projected\nCity tax revenues for each year of the\nFinancial Plan. Environmental Matters The City\nhas 520 miles of coastline, bordering the\nAtlantic Ocean as well as rivers, bays, and\ninlets. Four of its five Boroughs, Manhattan,\nStaten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens, are on\nislands and water also forms the principal\nboundary of the Bronx. As a result, the City\nis directly affected by rising sea levels,\ninland flooding, and exposed to intensifying\ncoastal storms. Two recent storms have\nsignificantly affected the City\u2019s Financial\nPlan and climate planning. Superstorm Sandy.\nOn Monday, October 29, 2012, Sandy hit the\nMid-Atlantic East Coast. The storm caused\nwidespread damage to the coastal and other\nlow-lying areas of the City and power failures\nin various parts of the City, including most\nof downtown Manhattan, the south shore of\nStaten Island, and the communities surrounding\nJamaica Bay in Brooklyn and Queens. On January\n29, 2013, President Obama signed legislation\nproviding for approximately $50.5 billion in\nstorm-related aid for the region affected by\nthe storm. Although it is not possible for the\nCity to quantify the full, long-term impact of\nthe storm on the City and its economy, the\ncurrent estimate of the direct costs to the\nCity, NYCHH and NYCHA is approximately $10.7\nbillion (comprised of approximately $1.8\nbillion of expense costs and approximately\n$8.9 billion of capital project costs). Such\ndirect costs represent funding for emergency\nresponse, debris removal, emergency protective\nmeasures, repair of damaged infrastructure and\nlong-term hazard mitigation investments. In\naddition to such direct costs, the City is\ndelivering Sandy-related disaster recovery\nassistance services, benefiting impacted\ncommunities, businesses, homeowners and\nrenters ( \u201c Community Costs \u201d ). The City\nanticipates that funding for Community Costs\nwill be primarily reimbursed with federal\nfunds. However, the City is responsible for\n$134 million of such Community Costs, which\nare reflected in the Financial Plan. In\naddition, the City may be responsible for up\nto approximately $150 million of additional\nCommunity Costs, which are not reflected in\nthe Financial Plan. The Financial Plan assumes\nthat the direct costs described above will\nlargely be paid from non-City sources,\nprimarily the federal government, and that the\nCommunity Costs described above will be\nprimarily reimbursed by federal funds. The\nCity\n\n55\n\nexpects reimbursements to come from two\nseparate federal sources of funding, FEMA and\nHUD. The City has secured approximately $10.8\nbillion in FEMA assistance and other federal\nemergency response grants ( \u201c FEMA Funding \u201d\n). The maximum reimbursement rate from FEMA is\n90% of total costs. Other federal emergency\nresponse grants may have larger local share\npercentages. The City expects to use $720\nmillion of Community Development Block Grant\nDisaster Recovery funding allocated by HUD to\nmeet the local share requirements of the FEMA\nfunding, as well as recovery work not funded\nby FEMA or other federal sources. This\nallocation would be available to fill gaps in\nsuch FEMA funding. As of March 31, 2023, the\nCity, NYCHH and NYCHA have received $5.7\nbillion in reimbursements from FEMA for the\ndirect costs described above. In addition to\nthe FEMA Funding described above, HUD has made\navailable over $4.4 billion for Community\nCosts, of which approximately $3.8 billion has\nbeen received through March 31, 2023. No\nassurance can be given that the City will be\nreimbursed for all of its costs or that such\nreimbursements will be received within the\ntime periods assumed in the Financial Plan.\nThere is no assurance, if the City were to\nexperience a similar storm in the future, that\nnon-City sources, including the federal\ngovernment, would pay the costs. Post-Tropical\nCyclone Ida. On September 1, 2021, Hurricane\nIda hit the Mid-Atlantic East Coast as a post-\ntropical cyclone ( \u201c Ida \u201d ), bringing\nsignificant rainfall and resulting in severe\nflooding in parts of the City, including\nprimarily inland areas. Rainfall from Ida\nexceeded the previous record for the most\nsingle-hour rainfall in the City and for the\nfirst time the National Weather Service\ndeclared a flash flood emergency in the City.\nIda resulted in the deaths of 13 people in the\nCity, 11 of which occurred in basement housing\nunits. On April 20, 2023, the City released\nPlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done ( \u201c PlaNYC\n2023 \u201d ). Building on prior recommendations\nreleased closely after Ida hit the City,\nPlaNYC 2023 includes measures to address\nflooding caused by extreme rainfall. The total\ncosts of implementing all of PlaNYC 2023\u2019s\nrecommendations, including those relating to\nextreme rainfall, would be substantial and in\nsome cases would require State and federal\nfunding alongside additional City funding. The\nCity continues to review the effects of\nclimate change, including increased flooding\nand heavy rain events. The City has created a\nnew Bureau of Coastal Resiliency led by an\nAssistant Commissioner at the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection to coordinate the\nCity\u2019s coastal resiliency work. Strategic\nPlanning and Resiliency. Since 2007, the City\nhas been engaged in strategic planning for\nclimate change, recognizing the challenges it\npresents for City operations and\ninfrastructure. Among other things, the City\ncreated the New York City Panel on Climate\nChange (the \u201c NPCC \u201d ), a body of more than a\ndozen leading independent climate and social\nscientists. Since 2008, NPCC has analyzed\nclimate trends, developed projections,\nexplored key impacts, issued reports (the \u201c\nNPCC Reports \u201d ) and advised on response\nstrategies for the City. The NPCC has\ndetermined that the City is already\nexperiencing the impacts of climate change and\nprojects dramatic impacts on the City in the\nfuture. Climate change is causing more extreme\nheat, extreme rainfall, coastal storm surge,\nand chronic tidal flooding. NPCC projections\nform the basis for the City\u2019s climate\nresiliency planning, which involves\ncoordination and cooperation among multiple\npublic and private stakeholders, and expansion\nof ongoing maintenance and development of\nmunicipal infrastructure as well as specific\ninitiatives such as those described below.\nBuilding on NPCC\u2019s recommendations and the\nCity\u2019s strategic planning, the City has\ndeveloped PlaNYC 2023 which addresses some of\nthe risks identified in the NPCC Reports.\nAmong other things, PlaNYC 2023 includes\nmeasures to address the biggest risks to the\nCity associated with climate change, including\nextreme heat and flooding from extreme\nrainfall, coastal storms and tidal flooding\ndue to sea level rise. PlaNYC 2023 also\ndescribes measures to reduce economy-wide\ngreenhouse gas emissions and initiatives to\ntransition away from polluting fossil fuels to\nclean energy. The City is in the process of\nimplementing infrastructure projects to\nprotect areas of the City from flooding\nassociated with extreme rainfall, storm surge,\nand tidal flooding due to sea level rise. (See\nbelow for additional information on the\nimpacts of flooding.) These projects and\ninitiatives are in various stages of\nfeasibility review, design, construction, and\nimplementation. Funding for these projects is\nexpected to come from City, State and federal\nsources. Some projects are expected to require\nadditional funding to the extent that they are\nin the planning stages or current funding does\nnot provide for the costs of construction.\nSeveral major coastal resiliency projects are\ncurrently underway throughout the City,\nincluding the East Side Coastal Resiliency\nProject ( \u201c ESCR \u201d ). ESCR, which broke ground\nin 2021, is an integrated coastal flood\nprotection system which will create resilient\nopen spaces and improve waterfront access on\nManhattan\u2019s east side, from East 25th Street\nat the north to Montgomery Street at the\nsouth. The City anticipates the entire flood\nprotection system will be in place and\noperational by the end of 2026. The total\nexpected cost of ESCR is $1.97 billion, with\nremaining costs fully funded through a\ncombination of City, federal and other funding\nsources.\n\n56\n\nOther projects in Lower Manhattan include\nconstructing flood walls and deployable flip-\nup barriers to protect the Two Bridges\nneighborhood, which lies south of Montgomery\nStreet at the north to the Brooklyn Bridge at\nthe south, developing a plan that contemplates\nextending the Manhattan shoreline from the\nBrooklyn Bridge to the Battery into the East\nRiver to protect the Seaport and Financial\nDistrict area, and constructing an elevated\nwaterfront esplanade in the Battery and flood\nbarriers in Battery Park City. Coastal\nresilience projects are also underway in the\nTottenville and Red Hook neighborhoods, and an\nenergy resilience project is underway in Hunts\nPoint, with shoreline reinforcement projects\nalso happening in other identified areas of\nthe City. These projects are in various stages\nof feasibility review, design, construction,\nand implementation. Funding for these projects\nis coming from City and federal sources, and\n$858 million is included in the Ten-Year\nCapital Strategy. As the projects proceed, the\nCity continues to monitor anticipated costs\nand reflects updates in the capital plan as\nneeded. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( \u201c\nUSACE \u201d ) is pursuing the South Shore of\nStaten Island Coastal Storm Risk Management\nProject (the \u201c Staten Island Project \u201d ) and\nthe Rockaways Atlantic Shorefront and Bayside\nProjects (the \u201c Rockaways Projects \u201d ). The\nStaten Island Project will create a 5.5-mile\nline of coastal protection on Staten Island\nbetween Fort Wadsworth and Oakwood Beach.\nUSACE currently estimates that the project\nwill cost $1.7 billion. The City is\nresponsible for 10.5% of the project costs,\nand the remaining project costs are to be paid\nfor with federal and State funds.\nApproximately half of the City\u2019s share of such\nproject costs is currently reflected in the\nTen-Year Capital Strategy. The Rockaways\nProjects consist of coastal protection\nelements on the Atlantic shorefront and on the\nJamaica Bay side of the Rockaways.\nConstruction has begun on the Atlantic\nShorefront Project, which is fully funded by\nthe federal government, with an expected cost\nof approximately $590 million. Design has\nstarted on the Bayside Project, which is fully\nfunded by the federal government, with a\ncurrent expected cost of $253 million. In\naddition to site-specific resiliency projects,\nthe City is taking steps to integrate climate\nresiliency into capital planning through the\nNYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines,\nwhich translate future-looking climate change\nprojections into technical guidance to inform\nthe design of roads, buildings, sewer systems,\nhospitals, public housing, and other pieces of\ncritical public infrastructure. In 2021, the\nCity began a five-year pilot program through\nwhich dozens of new projects will be designed\nand constructed using the standards in the NYC\nClimate Resiliency Design Guidelines. Starting\nin 2027, all City projects will be required to\nmeet a stringent set of requirements that will\ncertify their preparedness for extreme weather\nthreats. Reducing risk from extreme rainfall\nrequires a multi-layered strategy with\ninvestments in infrastructure adaptation,\nbuilding level protection, data collection,\nand community engagement. In July 2022, the\nCity released the Rainfall Ready NYC action\nplan, a plan to prepare the City for more\nextreme rainfall in the future. The City\ncontinues to install grey infrastructure, such\nas building out a comprehensive storm sewer\nsystem in Southeast Queens, and green\ninfrastructure, such as rain gardens and\nbluebelt wetlands, to manage stormwater and\nprotect water quality. This work is being\ncarried out by DEP and funding is included in\nthe City\u2019s capital budget. The City is also\nworking to develop Cloudburst management\nprojects that will use grey and green\ninfrastructure to absorb, store and transfer\nrainwater during extreme storm events. In\n2015, FEMA issued preliminary updated flood\ninsurance rate maps, which would have expanded\nthe 100-year floodplain beyond the areas\ndesignated in the flood maps issued in 2007.\nThe City appealed the 2015 preliminary flood\nmaps challenging the modeling FEMA used to\ndevelop them. The 2015 preliminary flood maps\nwere adopted into the building code, but the\nprior 2007 flood maps remain in effect for\nflood insurance purposes. In 2016, FEMA agreed\nwith the City\u2019s appeal, and the City is\ncurrently working with FEMA to update the\nmaps. FEMA\u2019s new maps are expected to\ngenerally expand the 100-year floodplain from\nthe 2007 flood maps and may cover different\nareas than the 2015 preliminary flood maps.\nSuch expansion could negatively impact\nproperty values in those newly designated\nareas. In addition, an increase in areas of\nthe City susceptible to flooding resulting\nfrom climate change could result in greater\nrecovery costs to the City if flooding were to\noccur within such larger areas. The City is\nalso committed to minimizing its own\ngreenhouse gas emissions by reaching carbon\nneutrality by 2050. The City\u2019s efforts to\nreach such goal include promoting and\ninvesting in electrification, clean energy,\nenergy efficiency, and sustainable\ntransportation, and reducing energy use. Since\n2014, the City has invested over $775 million\nin more than 12,500 energy conservation\nmeasures across almost 2,300 buildings,\ncomprising more than 70 percent of City\ngovernment\u2019s building square footage. The\ninvestments have decreased energy use and\nreduced emissions by nearly 325,000 metric\ntons. The Ten-Year Capital Strategy includes\n$3.9 billion to continue this work to reduce\nenergy use and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n57\n\nDespite the efforts described above, the\nmagnitude of the impact on the City\u2019s\noperations, economy, or financial condition\nfrom climate change is indeterminate and\nunpredictable. No assurance can be given that\nthe City will not encounter more frequent and\nintense climate impacts such as hurricanes,\ntropical storms, cloudbursts, droughts,\nheatwaves or catastrophic sea level rise in\nthe future, or that such risks will not have\nan adverse effect on the operations, economy\nor financial condition of the City.\nCybersecurity The City relies on a large and\ncomplex technology environment to conduct its\noperations. As a recipient and provider of\npersonal, private or sensitive information,\nthe City and its agencies and offices face\nmultiple cyber threats including, but not\nlimited to, hacking, viruses, malware and\nother attacks on computers and other sensitive\ndigital networks and systems. The City\u2019s\nOffice of Cyber Command ( \u201c Cyber Command \u201d ),\nwhich was created in 2017, is charged with\nsetting information security policies and\nstandards for the City, directing the City\u2019s\ncitywide cyber defense and incident response,\ndeploying defensive technical and\nadministrative controls and providing guidance\nto the Mayor and City agencies on cyber\ndefense. In January 2022, Cyber Command became\npart of the City\u2019s Office of Technology and\nInnovation ( \u201c OTI \u201d ) (formerly the\nDepartment of Information Technology and\nTelecommunications). Cyber Command has over\n100 full-time employees and works with\ndesignated cybersecurity contacts at each City\nagency as part of the Citywide Cybersecurity\nProgram. The Financial Plan reflects funding\nfor Cyber Command of $115.5 million in fiscal\nyear 2024 and approximately $105.5 million in\neach of fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Such\nfunding does not account for cybersecurity\nfunding at other City agencies. Cyber Command\nis built around two core cybersecurity\nfunctions: (1) threat management, which\nmanages incident response and cyber threat\nintelligence and vulnerability management,\nwhich helps agencies prioritize remediation\nefforts on identified unpatched systems in the\nCity\u2019s networks; and (2) security sciences,\nwhich manages strategic and tactical cyber\ndefense technologies and initiatives. In\ncarrying out its functions, Cyber Command\nworks with a range of City, State, and federal\nlaw enforcement agencies, including the New\nYork City Police Department and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task\nForce. In February 2022, the City and the\nState, along with the mayors of Albany,\nBuffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers,\nunveiled the Joint Security Operations Center.\nThe center has enhanced coordination of\ncybersecurity efforts across the State,\nhelping to foster collaboration among city,\nState, and federal entities. Cyber Command\nalso regularly works with other states and\nmunicipalities throughout the country to share\ncybersecurity threat intelligence and best\npractices, as well as with non-governmental\nentities such as utilities, telecommunications\nproviders and financial services companies for\nthe purpose of enhancing collective cyber\ndefenses. The City has developed standard\ncybersecurity policies and standards for third\nparty vendors of the City to follow, and\nsecurity provisions for contracts with\nvendors, which help ensure that the City is\nnotified of cyber breaches and suspected cyber\nbreaches of a vendor\u2019s network environment.\nThe City has also developed a Citywide\nIncident Response Policy, which requires City\nagencies to develop incident response plans in\naccordance with Cyber Command policies and\nstandards. While the City conducts periodic\ntests and reviews of its networks, no\nassurances can be given that such security and\noperational control measures will be\nsuccessful in guarding against all cyber\nthreats and attacks. New technical cyber\nvulnerabilities are discovered in the United\nStates daily. In addition, cyber attacks have\nbecome more sophisticated and are increasingly\ncapable of impacting municipal control systems\nand components. The techniques used to obtain\nunauthorized access to, or to disable or\ndegrade, electronic networks, computers,\nsystems and solutions are rapidly evolving and\nhave become increasingly complex and\nsophisticated. In addition, there is\nheightened risk due to an increase in remote\naccess to City systems by City employees as a\nresult of the outbreak of COVID-19. As\ncybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the\nCity may be required to expend significant\nadditional resources to continue to modify and\nstrengthen security measures, investigate and\nremediate any vulnerabilities, or invest in\nnew technology designed to mitigate security\nrisks. The results of any successful attack on\nthe City\u2019s computer and information technology\nsystems could impact its operations and damage\nthe City\u2019s digital networks and systems, and\nthe costs of remedying any such damage could\nbe substantial. Consistent with the City\u2019s\ngeneral policy to self-insure, the City does\nnot carry insurance against cyber attacks. On\nMay 31, 2023, a software vulnerability was\npublicly announced for the widely used file\nsharing software, MOVEit, which impacted both\nprivate and public sector entities worldwide.\nThe DOE was among those entities impacted. The\nthreat was immediately contained, and an\ninvestigation determined that approximately\n19,000 unique documents were accessed without\nauthorization, which contained a subset of\nsensitive data elements. The DOE has sent out\nindividual notifications. There is no evidence\nof any effects on the City\u2019s operations or\nharm to its digital networks.\n\n58\n\nThe NYC Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)\nwas expanded in October 2023. This program,\ndeveloped in partnership with a security\ntesting platform, broadens the scope of the\nCity\u2019s efforts to identify and address\nvulnerabilities within its publicly accessible\ndigital resources. By establishing guidelines,\nrules of engagement, and a secure channel for\nsecurity researchers to send vulnerability\nsubmissions, the program complements existing\nCyber Command initiatives, facilitating timely\nremediation of identified risks. Certain\nReports. Set forth below are summaries of the\nmost recent reports of the City Comptroller,\nOSDC and the staff of the Control Board. These\nsummaries do not purport to be comprehensive\nor definitive. On March 4, 2024, the City\nComptroller released \u201c Comments on New York\nCity\u2019s Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2025\nand Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2024-2028.\n\u201d The report notes that the City\u2019s increased\nCity-funded revenue projections of $4.71\nbillion for fiscal year 2025 essentially\nclosed the projected gap of $5.08 billion\nanticipated at the time of adoption of the\nfiscal year 2024 budget. However, the report\nstates that many predictable expenditures,\nsuch as rental assistance, special education\nCarter Cases and employee overtime, were\nunderbudgeted at the time of adoption of the\nfiscal year 2024 budget. Additionally, the\nCity\u2019s costs of services for asylum seekers\nincreased by up to 177% since the fiscal year\n2024 budget adoption. The report further\nstates that while the Financial Plan utilizes\nPEG savings and other resources to fund\nportions of previously underbudgeted costs,\nthe City Comptroller estimates that that the\nFinancial Plan does not account for $4.01\nbillion in underbudgeted expenses in fiscal\nyear 2024 and fiscal year 2025 combined.\nClosing these gaps will require strong fiscal\nmanagement, planning and implementing\nefficiency and cost savings in each budget\nmodification, and establishing a formula for\ndeposit in the City\u2019s long-term reserves.\nBased on the Financial Plan, the City\nComptroller projects net offsets of $214\nmillion in fiscal year 2024 and net risks of\n$3.30 billion, $3.42 billion, $3.23 billion,\nand $2.57 billion in fiscal years 2024 through\n2028, respectively. When added to the results\nprojected in the Financial Plan, the City\nComptroller projects a surplus of $214 million\nin fiscal year 2024, and budget gaps of $3.30\nbillion, $8.58 billion, $8.35 billion and\n$8.61 billion in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028, respectively, not including longer term\nnet risks associated with asylum seeker\nexpenses and the class size mandate. When such\nlonger-term net risks are included, the City\nComptroller projects a budget surplus of $337\nmillion in fiscal year 2024 and projected\nbudget gaps of $2.67 billion, $10.54 billion,\n$11.27 billion and $13.5 billion in fiscal\nyears 2025 through 2028, respectively. The\nCity Comptroller\u2019s net revenue projections are\nhigher than the budget projections by $618\nmillion, $482 million, $32 million, $79\nmillion and $742 million fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively. The report\nprojects that: (i) property tax revenues will\nbe lower by $39 million in fiscal year 2024\nand higher by $465 million, $292 million, $645\nmillion and $1.03 billion in fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028, respectively; (ii) personal\nincome tax revenues will be higher by $397\nmillion in fiscal year 2024 and lower by $129\nmillion, $82 million, $327 million and $290\nmillion in fiscal years 2025 through 2028,\nrespectively; (iii) business tax revenues will\nbe lower by $92 million, $95 million, $429\nmillion, $501 million and $376 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively;\n(iv) sales tax revenues will be higher by $21\nmillion, $94 million, $85 million, $155\nmillion and $208 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively; (v) real estate\ntransaction-related tax revenues will be\nhigher by $78 million in fiscal year 2024 and\nlower by $186 million, $201 million, $225\nmillion and $127 million in fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028, respectively; and (vi) tax audit\nand all other tax revenue will be higher by\n$218 million, $223 million, $233 million, $224\nmillion and $203 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively. The City\nComptroller\u2019s net expenditure projections are\nhigher by $404 million, $3.78 billion, $3.46\nbillion, $3.31 billion and $3.31 billion in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively,\nnot including net longer term risks associated\nwith asylum seeker expenses and the class size\nmandate, as a result of: (i) additional\novertime expenditures of $512 million and $737\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively, and $350 million in each of\nfiscal years 2026 through 2028; (ii) increased\nexpenditures for special education (Carter\nCases) of $540 million, $410 million, $340\nmillion and $340 million in fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028, respectively; (iii) increased\nexpenditures associated with rental assistance\nof $950 million in each of fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028; (iv) increased costs of\ncontributions to the MTA of $143 million, $268\nmillion, $450 million and $529 million in\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028, respectively;\n(v) increased non-asylum seeker shelter costs\nof $350 million in each of fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028; (vi) increased expenditures\nassociated with paying prevailing wage rates\nfor homeless shelter security guards of $50\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2025 through\n2028; (vii) increased public assistance costs\nof $375 million in each of fiscal years 2025\nand 2026 and $100 million in fiscal year 2027;\n(viii) increased expenditures for DOE COVID-19\naid resulting from fiscal cliffs of $287\nmillion in fiscal year 2025 and $367 million\nin each of fiscal years 2026 through 2028;\n(ix) increased expenditures associated with\nthe State\u2019s foster care reimbursement rate of\n$118 million in each of fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028; (x) increased expenditures for\ntemporary and professional services of $200\nmillion in fiscal year 2025; (xi) increased\ncosts of collective bargaining agreements of\n$70 million, $117 million, $166 million, $176\n\n59\n\nmillion and $193 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively; (xii) increased\nexpenditures for the DOE Medicaid revenue\nshortfall of $60 million in each of fiscal\nyears 2024 through 2028; (xiii) increased\nexpenditures of $112 million in fiscal year\n2024 related to reimbursement from the Health\nInsurance Stabilization Fund; and (xiv)\nanticipated personal services accrual savings\ndue to vacancies of $700 million and $150\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively. The City Comptroller also\nprojects longer term net expenditure risks\nassociated with asylum seeker expenses and the\nclass size mandate. Such projections include\n(i) decreased costs of providing services to\nasylum seekers of $123 million and $627\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively, and increased costs of providing\nsuch services of $1.49 billion, $1.99 billion\nand $3.49 billion in fiscal years 2026 through\n2028, respectively; and (ii) increased\nexpenditures resulting from the class size\nmandate of $467 million, $933 million and\n$1.40 billion in fiscal years 2026 through\n2028, respectively. On February 29, 2024, the\nOSDC released \u201c Review of the Financial Plan\nof the City of New York Report 19-2024 \u201d ,\ncommenting on the Financial Plan. The report\nnotes marked improvement in the City\u2019s\neconomic and fiscal outlook since the City\u2019s\nNovember budget modification. The City\u2019s\npreliminary fiscal year 2025 budget and the\nFinancial Plan close the projected $7.1\nbillion budget gap in fiscal year 2025 through\nsubstantial upward adjustments to total\nrevenues, historically large PEG savings, and\nutilization of contingency reserves. The\nreport notes that budget gaps remain subject\nto substantial volatility associated with\nlarge and difficult to predict spending risks,\nsuch as asylum seeker costs, rental assistance\nexpansion and the school class size mandate.\nThe report identifies net risks to the\nFinancial Plan of $135 million, $2.76 billion,\n$6.17 billion, $8.27 billion and $9.83 billion\nin fiscal years 2024 through 2028,\nrespectively. When combined with the results\nprojected in the Financial Plan, the report\nestimates potential budget gaps of $135\nmillion, $2.76 billion, $11.32 billion, $13.38\nbillion and $15.88 billion in fiscal years\n2024 through 2028, respectively. The specific\nrisks to the Financial Plan noted in the OSDC\nreport include: (i) increased costs of\noperating subsidies to the MTA of $143\nmillion, $268 million, $450 million and $450\nmillion in fiscal years 2025 through 2028,\nrespectively; (ii) increased expenditures for\nvarious social services (including those\nassociated with programs providing prevailing\nwages for Department of Homeless Services\nsecurity guards, foster care, emergency family\nand rental assistance and access to legal\ncounsel in housing court) of $254 million,\n$1.52 billion, $1.52 billion, $1.37 billion\nand $1.12 billion in fiscal years 2024 through\n2028, respectively; (iii) increased uniform\nservices overtime costs of $323 million, $620\nmillion, $586 million, $577 million and $582\nmillion in fiscal years 2024 through 2028,\nrespectively; (iv) increased expenditures for\nprograms associated with the DOE (such as\nproviding services to students with\ndisabilities, increases in charter school\ntuition rates, universal early childhood\neducation for three-year-olds and certain\nother education initiatives) of $719 million,\n$1.1 billion, $1.47 billion and $1.9 billion\nin fiscal years 2025 through 2028,\nrespectively; (v) increased expenditures\nrelated to the early childhood intervention\nprogram of $65 million in fiscal year 2025 and\n$76 million in each of fiscal years 2026\nthrough 2028; (vi) increased expenditures to\nfund school health programs of $36 million in\neach of fiscal years 2025 through 2028; (vii)\nincreased expenditures for Department of\nHealth and Mental Hygiene school nurses of $28\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2025 through\n2028; (viii) increased expenditures for\nsupportive housing of $20 million in each of\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028; (ix) increased\nexpenditures to fund the Public Health Corps\nof $13 million in fiscal year 2025 and $45\nmillion in each of fiscal years 2026 through\n2028; (x) youth meal program rate increases of\n$4 million in each of fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028; (xi) increased expenditures\nresulting from expansion of the Family\nHomelessness and Eviction Prevention\nSupplemental rental assistance program of $763\nmillion, $2.18 billion, $3.56 billion and\n$4.92 billion in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028, respectively; and (xii) decreased\nexpenditures for residual services for asylum\nseekers of $166 million and $457 million in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively, and\nincreased expenditures for such services of\n$1.43 billion, $1.47 billion and $2 billion in\nfiscal years 2026 through 2028, respectively.\nThe report also identifies (i) variable rate\ndebt service savings of $75 million in fiscal\nyear 2024 and (ii) increased tax revenues of\n$201 million, $710 million, $1.12 billion,\n$830 million and $1.34 billion in fiscal years\n2024 through 2028, respectively. On March 6,\n2024, the Control Board released its \u201c Staff\nReport FY 2024 January Modification and\nFinancial Plan. \u201d The report notes that the\nCity\u2019s economy continues to improve and\nstrengthen, with growing payroll employment, a\ndeclining unemployment rate, and a robust\nrebound in tourism. However, the commercial\nreal estate sector remains a drag on the\nCity\u2019s economy, with the Manhattan office\nvacancy rate at a record high. The Control\nBoard report identified estimated net offsets\nto the Financial Plan of $100 million in\nfiscal year 2024 and net risks of $2.17\nbillion, $3.72 billion, $5.86 billion and\n$7.33 billion in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028, respectively, resulting in a projected\nbudget surplus of $100 million in fiscal year\n2024 and projected budget gaps of $2.17\nbillion, $8.87 billion, $10.98 billion and\n$13.37 billion in fiscal years 2025 through\n2028, respectively. Such net risks result\nfrom: (i) decreased expenditures\n\n60\n\nresulting from lower reimbursements for\nparatransit costs of $49 million in fiscal\nyear 2024 and increased expenditures resulting\nfrom higher reimbursements for such\nparatransit costs of $97 million, $108\nmillion, $118 million and $128 million in\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028, respectively;\n(ii) increased expenditures for MTA Bus\noperations of $73 million, $42 million, $137\nmillion, $260 million and $310 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively;\n(iii) increased expenditures associated with\nthe State\u2019s foster care reimbursement rate of\n$118 million in each of fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2028; (iv) increased expenditures\nassociated with the Family Homelessness and\nEviction Prevention Supplement rental\nassistance program of $749 million, $2.1\nbillion, $3.5 billion and $4.8 billion in\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028, respectively;\n(v) increased expenditures associated with\nproviding services to students with\ndisabilities of $540 million and $410 million\nin fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively,\nand $340 million in each of fiscal years 2027\nand 2028; (vi) decreased expenditures\nassociated with Education Aid of $299 million\nin fiscal year 2025; (vii) increased\nexpenditures associated with State-mandated\nclass size reduction of $633 million, $1.27\nbillion and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2026\nthrough 2028, respectively; (viii) an increase\nin uniformed services overtime expenses of\n$264 million, $618 million, $586 million, $578\nmillion and $578 million in fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2028, respectively; (ix) increased\nexpenditures associated with nurses\u2019 wage\nincreases of $128 million, $131 million, $134\nmillion, $138 million and $154 million in\nfiscal years 2024 through 2028, respectively;\n(x) increased expenditures for nurse\ncontractual services of $87 million in each of\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028; and (xi)\nincreased expenditures for the costs of\nservices for asylum seekers of $190 million in\nfiscal year 2025 and decreased expenditures\nfor such costs of $59 million in fiscal year\n2026. The report also identifies (i) increases\nin property tax revenues of $425 million, $496\nmillion, $271 million and $391 million in\nfiscal years 2025 through 2028, respectively;\nand (ii) increases in non-property tax\nrevenues of $516 million, $43 million, $277\nmillion and $699 million in fiscal years 2024,\n2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively, and\ndecreases in non-property tax revenues of $320\nmillion in fiscal year 2025. Outstanding\nGeneral Obligation Indebtedness . As of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately $39.73\nbillion of City general obligation bonds were\noutstanding. As of December 31, 2023, Hudson\nYards Infrastructure Corporation ( \u201c HYIC \u201d )\nhas outstanding approximately $2.5 billion\naggregate principal amount of bonds. In\naddition, HYIC has entered into a term loan\nfacility with Bank of America, N.A. pursuant\nto which HYIC may draw up to an aggregate\namount of $380 million, approximately $46.7\nmillion of which has been drawn as of December\n31, 2023. The term loan facility has a\nscheduled maturity of June 30, 2027. HYIC\nexpects to issue bonds to repay such term loan\nfacility or further extend the maturity date\nprior to the scheduled maturity. The bonds\nfinanced the extension of the Number 7 subway\nline and other public improvements in the\nHudson Yards area, and the term loan will be\nused to finance any remaining costs of\ncompletion of the original project and the\nexpansion of the park in the Hudson Yards\narea. HYIC\u2019s bonds and, on a subordinate\nbasis, draws under the term loan facility are\nsecured by and payable from payments in lieu\nof taxes and other revenues generated by\ndevelopment in the Hudson Yards area. To the\nextent payments in lieu of taxes and other\nHYIC revenues are insufficient to pay interest\non the HYIC bonds or the term loan, the City\nhas agreed to pay the amount of any shortfall\nin interest, subject to appropriation. No such\npayments have been required since fiscal year\n2015. The City has no obligation to pay the\nprincipal of such bonds or of such term loan.\nWater and Sewer . The City\u2019s financing program\nincludes the issuance of water and sewer\nrevenue bonds by the Water Authority which is\nauthorized to issue bonds to finance capital\ninvestment in the City\u2019s water and sewer\nsystem. Pursuant to State law, debt service on\nWater Authority indebtedness is secured by\nwater and sewer fees paid by users of the\nwater and sewer system. Such fees are revenues\nof the Water Board, which holds a lease\ninterest in the City\u2019s water and sewer system.\nAfter providing for debt service on\nobligations of the Water Authority and certain\nincidental costs, the revenues of the Water\nBoard are paid to the City to cover the City\u2019s\ncosts of operating the water and sewer system\nand as rental for the system. In fiscal years\n2019, 2022 and 2023, the City did not request\nthe rental payment due to the City from the\nWater Board. In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, on\naccount of the outbreak of COVID-19, the City\nrequested rental payments of $128 million and\n$137 million, respectively. The Financial Plan\nreflects rental payment requests of $145\nmillion for fiscal year 2024 and $295 million\nfor fiscal year 2025. The Financial Plan does\nnot reflect any rental payment requests for\nfiscal years 2026 through 2028. The City\u2019s\nTen-Year Capital Strategy applicable to the\nCity\u2019s water and sewer system covering fiscal\nyears 2024 through 2033, projects City-funded\nwater and sewer investment (which is expected\nto be financed with proceeds of Water\nAuthority debt) at approximately $28.3\nbillion. The 2024-2028 Capital Commitment Plan\nreflects total anticipated City-funded water\nand sewer commitments of $15.4 billion which\nare expected to be financed with the proceeds\nof Water Authority debt. New York City\nTransitional Finance Authority . The TFA is\nauthorized to have outstanding $13.5 billion\nof Future Tax Secured Bonds. The TFA may have\noutstanding Future Tax Secured Bonds in excess\nof $13.5 billion provided that the amount of\nthe Future Tax Secured Bonds, together with\nthe amount of indebtedness contracted by the\nCity, do not exceed the debt limit of\n\n61\n\nthe City. Future Tax Secured Bonds are issued\nfor general City capital purposes and are\nsecured by the City\u2019s personal income tax\nrevenues and, to the extent such revenues do\nnot satisfy specified debt ratios, sales tax\nrevenues. In addition, the TFA is authorized\nto have outstanding $9.4 billion of Building\nAid Revenue Bonds to pay for a portion of the\nCity\u2019s five-year educational facilities\ncapital plan. Building Aid Revenue Bonds are\nsecured by State building aid, which the Mayor\nhas assigned to the TFA. Implementation of the\nfinancing program is dependent upon the\nability of the City and other financing\nentities to market their securities\nsuccessfully in the public credit markets\nwhich will be subject to prevailing market\nconditions at the times of sale. No assurance\ncan be given that the credit markets will\nabsorb the projected amounts of public bond\nsales. A significant portion of bond financing\nis used to reimburse the City\u2019s General Fund\nfor capital expenditures already incurred. If\nthe City and such other entities are unable to\nsell such amounts of bonds, it would have an\nadverse effect on the City\u2019s cash position. In\naddition, the need of the City to fund future\ndebt service costs from current operations may\nalso limit the City\u2019s capital program. The\nTen-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years\n2024 through 2033 totals $164.8 billion, of\nwhich approximately 97.5% is to be financed\nwith funds borrowed by the City and such other\nentities. Congressional developments affecting\nfederal taxation generally could reduce the\nmarket value of tax-favored investments and\nincrease the debt-service costs of carrying\nout the major portion of the City\u2019s capital\nplan which is currently eligible for tax-\nexempt financing. NEW YORK STATE New York is\nthe fourth most populous state in the nation,\nafter California, Texas, and Florida, and has\na relatively high level of personal wealth.\nThe State\u2019s economy is diverse, with a\ncomparatively large share of the nation\u2019s\nfinancial activities, information, education,\nand health services employment, and a small\nshare of the nation\u2019s farming and mining\nactivity. The State\u2019s location, air transport\nfacilities, and natural harbors have made it\nan important hub for international commerce.\nTravel and tourism constitute an important\npart of the economy. Like the rest of the\nnation, New York has a declining proportion of\nits workforce engaged in manufacturing and an\nincreasing proportion engaged in service\nindustries. Manufacturing employment continues\nto stagnate as a share of total State nonfarm\nemployment, as in most other states. As a\nresult, New York\u2019s economy is less reliant on\nthis sector than in the past. However, it\nremains an important sector of the State\neconomy, particularly for the upstate region,\nwhich hosts higher concentrations of\nmanufacturers. As defined under the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System\n(NAICS), the trade, transportation, and\nutilities supersector accounts for the second\nlargest component of State nonfarm employment\nbut only the fifth largest when measured by\nwage share. This sector accounts for a smaller\nshare of employment and wages for the State\nthan for the nation. New York City is the\nnation\u2019s leading center for banking and\nfinance. For this reason, this sector is far\nmore important for the State than for the\nnation. Although this sector accounts for less\nthan one-tenth of all nonfarm jobs in the\nState, it accounts for one-fifth of total\nwages. The remaining service-producing sectors\ninclude information, professional and business\nservices, private education and healthcare,\nleisure and hospitality services, and other\nservices. When combined, these industries\naccount for over half of all nonfarm jobs in\nNew York. Information, education and health,\nand other services account for a higher\npercentage of total State employment than for\nthe nation. Farming is an important part of\nthe State\u2019s rural economy, although it\nconstitutes only 0.2 percent of the total\nState GDP. According to the New York State\nDepartment of Agriculture and Markets, New\nYork is the fifth largest dairy producer in\nthe nation. Federal, State, and local\ngovernments comprise the third largest sector\nin terms of nonfarm jobs. Public education is\nthe source of over 40 percent of total State\nand local government employment. Annual\nInformation Statement . The Annual Information\nStatement, dated June 9, 2023 (AIS), reflects\nthe State\u2019s Enacted Budget Financial Plan (the\n\u201c Financial Plan \u201d ) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024\nissued by the Division of the Budget (DOB) and\nsets forth the State\u2019s official Financial Plan\nprojections for Fiscal Year 2024 through\nFiscal Year 2027 (the \u201c Financial Plan period\n\u201d ). DOB released the third quarter update to\nthe AIS on March 5, 2024 (the \u201c AIS Update \u201d\n). The AIS Update is dated February 15, 2024\n(the same date as the release date of the\nGovernor\u2019s Executive Budget Financial Plan for\nFY 2025, as amended) and contains information\nonly through that date. The AIS Update\nincludes information on the State\u2019s current\nfinancial\n\n62\n\nprojections, including summaries and extracts\nfrom the Governor\u2019s Executive Budget Financial\nPlan for FY 2025, as amended (the \u201c Updated\nFinancial Plan \u201d or \u201c Updated Executive Budget\nFinancial Plan \u201d ) issued by DOB on February\n15, 2024. The Updated Financial Plan (which is\navailable on the DOB website,\nwww.budqet.ny.gov) includes a summary of third\nquarter operating results for FY 2024 (quarter\nended December 31, 2023) and updates to the\nState\u2019s official financial projections for FY\n2024 through FY 2027 (the \u201c Financial Plan\nperiod \u201d ). 1 Except for the specific\nrevisions described in the AIS Update, the\nprojections (and the assumptions upon which\nthey are based) in the Updated Financial Plan\nare consistent with the projections set forth\nin the FY 2024 Enacted Budget Financial Plan\n(the \u201c Enacted Budget Financial Plan \u201d )\nreflected in the AIS. DOB next expects to\nupdate the State\u2019s multi-year financial\nprojections with the FY 2025 Enacted Budget\nFinancial Plan. In addition to regularly\nscheduled quarterly updates to the AIS, the\nState may issue AIS supplements or other\ndisclosure notices related to the AIS as\nevents warrant. The State intends to announce\npublicly whenever an update or a supplement is\nissued. The State has filed the AIS and the\nAIS Update with the Municipal Securities\nRulemaking Board through its Electronic\nMunicipal Market Access (EMMA) system.\nElectronic copies of the AIS and the AIS\nUpdate can be accessed through EMMA at\nwww.emma.msrb.org. 1 The State fiscal year is\nidentified by the calendar year in which it\nends. For example, fiscal year 2024 ( \u201c FY\n2024 \u201d ) is the fiscal year that began on\nApril 1, 2023 and will end on March 31, 2024.\nThe annual State budget process and financial\nreporting cycle begins with the start of a new\nState fiscal year on April 1 and the enactment\nof the State\u2019s annual budget (the \u201c Enacted\nBudget \u201d ), which may be after the start of\nthe fiscal year. Following the Enacted Budget,\nDOB publishes the State\u2019s Enacted Budget\nFinancial Plan and generally updates it\nquarterly to reflect results through June 30\n(the \u201c First Quarterly Update to the Financial\nPlan \u201d ), September 30 (the \u201c Mid-Year Update\nto the Financial Plan \u201d ), and December 31\n(the \u201c Executive Budget Financial Plan \u201d ). In\naddition, the Governor\u2019s Executive Budget\nproposal (the \u201c Executive Budget \u201d ) is\ntypically submitted to the Legislature in\nJanuary and the Governor\u2019s amendments are due\nwithin thirty days following the submission of\nthe Executive Budget, at which time the\nExecutive Budget Financial Plan may be amended\n(the \u201c Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan\n\u201d ). However, following a gubernatorial\nelection, the Governor\u2019s Executive Budget\nproposal is due on or before the first day of\nFebruary and amendments are due in early\nMarch. FINANCIAL PLAN OVERVIEW Summary of\nRevisions to the Executive Budget Financial\nPlan The Updated Executive Budget Financial\nPlan projections set forth in the AIS Update\nreflect the impact of the Governor\u2019s\namendments submitted on February 15, 2024 and\nlimited forecast revisions. Nearly all the\namendments to the FY 2025 Executive Budget\nincluded in the Governor\u2019s submission have no\nFinancial Plan impact. Two amendments drive\nadditional General Fund costs in FY 2025,\nwhich are fully offset by forecast revisions\nreflected in the Updated Executive Budget\nFinancial Plan. Otherwise, projections of\nreceipts and spending (and the assumptions\nupon which they are based) are unchanged from\nthe Executive Budget Financial Plan dated\nJanuary 16, 2024: \u2022 30-Day Amendments: General\nFund transfers in FY 2025 are increased to\nreflect up to $100 million in additional State\nsupport for operating expenses at the State\nUniversity Health Sciences Center at Brooklyn\nand/or the State University of New York (SUNY)\nHospital at Brooklyn, pursuant to a\ntransformation plan approved by the Director\nof the Budget. In addition, a $100 million\ntransfer from the New York Interest on Lawyers\nAccount (IOLA) to the General Fund in FY 2025\nis removed. \u2022 Forecast Revisions: DOB has made\nupward forecast revisions in FY 2025 to\nmiscellaneous receipts to reflect an\nadditional $100 million in expected resources\nfrom abandoned property and a $100 million\nincrease in expected Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) reimbursements based\non continued review and submission of prior-\nyear eligible costs incurred by multiple\nagencies. The Economic Outlook section in the\nAIS Update includes modest changes to reflect\nactual 2023 data published after the Executive\nBudget Financial Plan was released. On or\nbefore March 1, 2024, as required by law, the\nExecutive and Legislature are expected to\nissue a joint report containing a consensus\nforecast for the economy and projections of\ncertain receipts for the current and upcoming\nfiscal years. In the consensus forecast\nreport, the parties are expected to forecast\nthe level of receipts over the two-year period\n(FY 2024 and FY 2025). Any revisions to the\nExecutive Budget Financial Plan receipts\nforecast from the consensus forecast process\nwill be reflected in the Enacted Budget\nFinancial Plan.\n\n63\n\nIn addition, the District Council 37 Rent\nRegulation Services Unit recently ratified a\nthree-year labor agreement which runs until\nApril 1, 2026 and covers roughly 300\nemployees. The terms of the agreement are\nconsistent with other agreements with settled\nunions and include 3 percent general salary\nincreases in all years and a one-time $3,000\nbonus. The Financial Plan includes reserves\nfor labor agreements, which may be allocated\nto specific agencies in future updates. The\nUpdated Financial Plan described in the AIS\nUpdate includes the changes described above.\nThe changes have no net impact on General Fund\noperations, State Operating Funds spending, or\nthe estimated outyear General Fund budget gaps\nfrom the Executive Budget Financial Plan.\nFinancial Plan Overview Over the past two\nyears, the State\u2019s financial position has\nstrengthened significantly. Reserves have\nincreased to the highest levels in history,\ndebt levels remain nearly flat at less than 1\npercent growth over the past decade, historic\nliquidity levels are delivering high\ninvestment returns, and new reserves have been\nestablished for future costs. The\nextraordinary influx of resources during the\npost-COVID-19 period fueled these financial\nachievements and allowed the State to make\nhistoric investments to adequately fund\nessential services and programs. These\ninvestments include fully funding the\nFoundation Aid formula; expanding access to\nmental health services; increasing assistance\nto hospitals, other health care providers and\nworkers; addressing the solvency of the\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA);\naiding the City of New York for the provision\nof care for thousands of asylum seekers;\nincreasing wages; supporting health care\ndelivery improvements; increasing recurring\nsupport for SUNY and CUNY; addressing gun\ncrime and violence; and expanding access to\nchild care, housing, school lunches and energy\naffordability. Roughly half of the State\nOperating Funds budget supports the State\u2019s\ntwo largest program areas - health care and\neducation. Spending for assistance and grants\nin FY 2025 is projected to be nearly $23\nbillion (32 percent) higher than the level\nrecorded in FY 2022. 2 Roughly two-thirds of\nthe estimated growth is concentrated in health\ncare and education, reflecting historic,\nrecurring funding increases for schools and\nthe health care system. While the State\u2019s\ninvestments over the past two years recur, the\nelevated levels of tax receipts that initially\nsupported the increased funding do not.\nFollowing two-years of substantially stronger\ntax collections, New York began to experience\na precipitous drop in tax receipts beginning\nin FY 2024. The updated projections for tax\nreceipts 3 in the current year are expected to\ndecline by 7.8 percent from FY 2023 levels,\nfollowed by growth of 2.5 percent in FY 2025\nfrom this lower base. This decline in tax\nreceipts was also experienced by the Federal\ngovernment and other states that rely on\npersonal income taxes as a significant share\nof their revenues. 2 Excludes roughly $3\nbillion in one-time COVID-19 pandemic\nassistance and grants spending. 3 Tax receipts\nand General Fund balance are affected by the\nPass-Through Entity Tax (PTET); however, DOB\nexpects that the PTET will, on a multi-year\nbasis, be revenue neutral for the State. The\ndiscussion of tax receipts throughout the\nFinancial Plan Overview excludes the impact of\nPTET, unless otherwise noted. The long-term,\nhistorical average annual growth rate for tax\nreceipts, which support roughly 80 percent of\nState Operating Funds spending, is roughly 4\npercent. Tax receipts are projected to grow on\naverage by 4 percent annually over the\nFinancial Plan period from FY 2024 levels,\nwhile spending is projected to grow by just\nover 5 percent on average through FY 2028,\nresulting in a structural imbalance.\nAccordingly, in preparing the FY 2025\nExecutive Budget, the structural General Fund\nbudget gaps required the State to evaluate\nmulti-year growth assumptions across all\nprograms to ensure long-term sustainability\nwithin projected resources. The FY 2025\nExecutive Budget proposal reduces the multi-\nyear budget gaps and provides for balanced\nGeneral Fund operations on a cash basis in FY\n2025, while preserving existing commitments\nand funding new investments to address\ncritical needs. Proposed savings initiatives\nare intended to prudently use resources from\nNew York taxpayers to continue support for\ninvestments made over the past two years in\neducation, physical and mental health care,\npublic safety, economic stability, and\nenvironmental protection; and continue to\nensure assistance is available for individuals\nand entities with demonstrable need. The\nExecutive Budget also includes new funding for\nservices and initiatives consistent with\nannouncements made by the Governor in her\nState of the State plan presented on January\n9, 2024. In addition, State Medicaid spending\nis increased, consistent with the recently\napproved 1115 Medicaid Waiver Amendment, and\nexpanded support to assist the City of New\nYork with aiding asylum seekers. In the\nUpdated Financial Plan, DOB is increasing the\nestimate for tax receipts and other resources\nin all years from the levels forecasted in the\nMid-Year Update to the Financial Plan. The\nprojection for General Fund tax receipts, over\nthe multi-year Financial Plan, excluding\nproposed extensions, is revised upward by $5.9\nbillion from the forecast included in the Mid-\nYear\n\n64\n\nUpdate. In the current year (FY 2024), the\nupward revision in tax receipts, combined with\nthe reserve for transaction risk that was set\naside for FY 2024, and other revisions, leave\nan estimated General Fund surplus of $2.2\nbillion. The surplus will be used to prepay\n$1.7 billion in FY 2025 expenses to reduce the\nbudget year gap, and the remaining $500\nmillion will be set aside in reserves for\nfuture one-time costs related to assisting\nasylum seekers. The Executive Budget maintains\nPrincipal Reserves at 15 percent of State\nOperating Funds spending to protect essential\nservices in the event of an economic downturn,\nas well as other reserves for dedicated\npurposes to manage risks to the Financial Plan\nand future costs. DOB expects that the General\nFund will have sufficient liquidity in FY 2025\nto make all planned payments as they become\ndue, and the General Fund balance will\ncontinue to benefit the State by providing\nhigh levels of investment income due to\nelevated market interest rates. DOB continues\nto reserve money on a quarterly basis for debt\nservice payments that are financed with\nGeneral Fund resources. Money to pay debt\nservice on bonds secured by dedicated\nreceipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax\nbonds, continues to be set aside as required\nby law and bond covenants. FY 2025 Executive\nBudget Financial Plan Summary The Updated\nFinancial Plan reflects the Governor\u2019s FY 2025\nExecutive Budget proposal and accompanying\nlegislation introduced on January 16, 2024, as\nwell as revisions to the projections of\nreceipts and spending in all years based on\nresults to date, updated forecasts, and\nadjustments to programmatic assumptions. DOB\nestimates that the General Fund is balanced on\na cash basis in FY 2025, should the\nLegislature adopt the Governor\u2019s proposal\nwithout modification. DOB expects the General\nFund to end FY 2025 with a balance of nearly\n$44 billion. Approximately half of the balance\nconsists of Principal Reserves to protect\nessential services in the event of an economic\ndownturn. The remaining balance is comprised\nof other reserves that were previously pledged\nto reduce outyear gaps, manage risks and\nsupport future costs that include tax refunds\nand liabilities, capital projects, and\npotential labor agreements. The Executive\nBudget supports the implementation and\nexpansion of various initiatives laid out in\nthe Governor\u2019s State of the State plan\npresented to the Legislature on January 9,\n2024, and continues funding for existing\ncommitments, including increased funding for\nFoundation Aid, support for Medicaid and\ndistressed hospitals, increases in the minimum\nwage, and expanded access to affordable child\ncare. The Executive Budget proposal increases\nFY 2025 State Operating Funds spending by $5.9\nbillion (4.5 percent) compared to the prior\nyear, adjusted for the routine management of\nresources, execution of prepayments, and\nfluctuations in the timing of transactions\nacross fiscal years that impact reported\nspending growth. Nearly two-thirds of the\nproposed growth is driven by increased\nspending on School Aid and Medicaid. School\nAid The State provides a substantial amount of\nfinancial support for public schools through\nState formula aids and grants. For over a\ndecade, New York has ranked the highest in the\nnation for per pupil spending. In school year\n(SY) 2021, New York spent $26,571 per pupil,\n85 percent more than the national average of\n$14,347 per pupil. 4 In SY 2024, approximately\n2.4 million kindergarten through 12th grade\nstudents are enrolled in the State\u2019s public\nschools, including 182,000 students enrolled\nin charter schools. Compared to SY 2014\nlevels, enrollment in the State\u2019s public\nschools has declined by roughly 10 percent\n(268,000 students). Despite these enrollment\ndeclines, State aid has continued to increase\neach year. From SY 2021 to SY 2024, total\nSchool Aid grew by an average of $2.3 billion\n(7.7 percent) per year (excluding the SY 2022\nPandemic Adjustment restoration), driven\nprimarily by the three-year phase-in of full\nfunding of the Foundation Aid formula. In\naddition to State aid, school districts have\ncontinued to raise revenue through local\nproperty tax increases, which when combined\nwith State aid increases and Federal COVID-19\npandemic related assistance, have afforded\nmany districts the ability to amass\nsubstantial reserves and surplus balances. 4\nBased on U.S. Census Bureau, 2021 Annual\nSurvey of School System Finances . Adding to\nthe historic increases in funding over the\npast three years, the Executive Budget\nincludes $35.3 billion for School Aid in SY\n2025, an increase of approximately $921\nmillion (2.7 percent), inclusive of the\nState\u2019s full takeover of funding for\nprekindergarten expansion grants previously\nsupported with Federal American Rescue Plan\nAct of 2021 (ARP) funds.\n\n65\n\nExcluding the State funds needed to support\nthis takeover, the School Aid increase for SY\n2025 totals $825 million (2.4 percent). This\ngrowth reflects a $507 million (2.1 percent)\nFoundation Aid increase. Since SY 2022, State-\nfunded School Aid will have increased by over\n$6 billion (21 percent), inclusive of the\nExecutive Budget\u2019s proposed increase. Medicaid\nThe New York State Medicaid Program provides\nhealth and long-term care coverage to lower-\nincome children, pregnant women, adults,\nseniors, and people with disabilities, and is\nfinanced jointly by the Federal, State, and\nLocal governments. New York receives the\nminimum Federal Medicaid matching share of\nroughly 50 percent. Local districts\u2019 costs\nhave been capped at calendar year 2015 levels,\nshifting the increased costs to the State and\nsaving the City of New York and counties an\nestimated $7.4 billion in FY 2025. The State\noffers some of the most comprehensive and\nextensive Medicaid benefits in the nation,\nincluding optional services such as coverage\nfor pharmacy and personal care services,\nspending $3,582 per capita based on the latest\nCMS data (Federal Fiscal Year 2021) 5 , which\nwas more than any other state. New York\u2019s per\ncapita spending was 10 percent higher than the\nnext highest state, New Mexico which spent\n$3,245 per capita. Nearly 7.6 million (39\npercent) New Yorkers are currently covered by\nMedicaid. When combined with other public\ninsurance coverage, New York has the highest\npercent of people covered by publicly funded\nmedical insurance (Medicaid, Child Health Plus\n(CHP) and Essential Plan (EP)) in the nation.\n5 Excludes District of Columbia. Based on U.S.\nCensus Bureau data and the 2021 Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services Financial\nReport, Expenditure Reports From MBES/CBES.\nThe Medicaid program is also a large\ncontributor of funding to hospitals and\nnursing homes through various supplemental\nprograms. Medicaid spending growth continues\nto escalate as utilization of the system,\nprimarily Managed Long Term Care (MLTC), rises\nwith an aging population. In FY 2025, Medicaid\nspending is projected to total $30.9 billion,\nan increase of $3 billion (10.9 percent) from\nthe revised FY 2024 levels, including over $1\nbillion in savings proposals. State-share\nMedicaid spending, including administrative\ncosts, is projected to be $8.6 billion (39\npercent) higher in FY 2025 than the levels\nrecorded three years prior in FY 2022. Other\nSpending Growth The Executive Budget also\nproposes spending increases to support agency\noperations and addresses the State\u2019s many\ncontinuing challenges, including access to\nmental health care, public safety, the\nstability of the State\u2019s health care system,\nand an extension and expansion of\nextraordinary State funding to continue to\nassist the City of New York with providing\nservices and assistance to asylum seekers. In\naddition to significant investments made in\nthe past two years, the FY 2025 Budget\nprovides funding to expand mental health\nservices for children and teens through school\nand pediatric health care settings; increases\npregnant and postpartum services; grants the\nDepartment of Financial Services (DFS)\nauthority to hold insurers accountable for\nmental health coverage; addresses the opioid\nepidemic; advances a plan consistent with the\nrecent Federal government waiver approval to\nimprove health care delivery; adds funding for\nlaw enforcement activities; increases access\nto swimming and instruction; and funds other\nprogram enhancements and initiatives. The\nExecutive Budget also adds substantial new\ncapital funding for Artificial Intelligence\n(Al) research and innovation; economic\ndevelopment initiatives; energy affordability\nimprovements; incentives for communities to\ngrow their housing stock; and storm and flood\nrisk remediation and protection. State\nSpending The Executive Budget proposal drives\nFY 2025 State Operating Funds spending to\n$136.2 billion, an increase of $5.9 billion\n(4.5 percent) compared to the current FY 2024\nestimate, excluding the routine management of\nresources, execution of prepayments, and\nfluctuations in the timing of transactions and\nreimbursements across fiscal years. FY 2025\nspending growth is largely driven by Medicaid,\nSchool Aid and increased operational funding\nfor SUNY and all branches of State government\nas agencies continue to strive to restore\nservice capacity and workforce levels to pre-\nCOVID-19 pandemic levels.\n\n66\n\nMedicaid spending is driven largely by\nelevated enrollment relative to pre-COVID-19\npandemic levels; expansion of benefits;\nincreases in reimbursement rates; and growing\nutilization of the State\u2019s MLTC program by the\nState\u2019s aging population. Spending for\nassistance and grants has grown from $72\nbillion in FY 2022, adjusted to exclude\nCOVID-19 pandemic assistance and recovery\nspending, to nearly $95 billion of projected\nspending in FY 2025. The $23 billion (32\npercent) increase reflects historic\ninvestments over the preceding years in\neducation, health care and other assistance\nand program growth. Spending growth is\nroutinely impacted by planned prepayments and\ntiming-related transactions and\nreimbursements. In FY 2025, spending growth\nreflects the planned payment of FY 2025\npension expenses in FY 2024; delayed\nrecoupment from providers of excess payments\nattributable to State-only Medicaid payments\nthat were previously advanced and are now\nexpected in FY 2025; the expiration of the\ntemporary enhanced Federal Medical Assistance\nPercentage (eFMAP) that lowers Medicaid costs\nin FY 2024; COVID-19 pandemic related FEMA\nreimbursements that are expected to lower\nspending to offset costs accounted for in\nprior years; and the impact of prior year debt\nservice prepayments. Accounting for these\ntransactions, State Operating Funds spending\nis projected to total $129.3 billion, an\nincrease of $2.7 billion (2.1 percent).\nIncluding spending for capital projects and\nspending supported by the Federal government,\nAll Funds spending is estimated to total\n$232.7 billion in FY 2025, an increase of $1\nbillion (0.5 percent), from the current fiscal\nyear estimate. The increase in All Funds\nspending is attributable to the end of\nCOVID-19 pandemic related recovery and\nassistance provided through increased Federal\nfunding and reimbursements, which is partly\noffset by significant increases in capital\nprojects spending consistent with approved and\nproposed capital commitments. Outyear Budget\nGaps The Updated Executive Budget Financial\nPlan provides savings that reduce the outyear\nbudget gaps to $5 billion in FY 2026, $5.2\nbillion in FY 2027, and $9.9 billion in FY\n2028? In comparison, the budget gaps in the\nMid-Year Update to the Financial Plan were\n$9.5 billion in FY 2026, $7.7 billion in FY\n2027, and $16.5 billion in FY 2028. If the FY\n2026 Budget is balanced with recurring\nsavings, the budget gap for FY 2027 would be\nnearly eliminated and the FY 2028 gap would be\nreduced to roughly $5 billion. The outyear\nbudget gaps are the result of a structural\nimbalance between the forecasted levels of\nspending growth and available resources. The\ngaps include Medicaid spending projections\nthat exceed the Global Cap beginning in FY\n2026, which is partly due to $1.7 billion in\nadditional State spending over the multi-year\nFinancial Plan to leverage roughly $6 billion\nin additional Federal Medicaid funding, as\nwell as upward revisions reflecting sustained\nenrollment levels and spending for MLTC. The\nprojected budget gaps do not reflect the use\nof any principal reserves to balance\noperations but do include the use of prior\nyear surpluses carried forwarded into future\nyears and the one-time use of a portion of the\nReserve for Economic Uncertainties to fund\nadditional assistance to the City of New York\nto alleviate fiscal pressures from asylum\nseekers in FY 2026. In addition, the projected\nbudget gap for FY 2027 includes a one-time\nacceleration of between $3 and $4 billion in\nestimated PIT tax receipts due to the\nscheduled expiration of the Federal State and\nLocal Tax (SALT) Cap at the end of 2025 and\nexpectation that taxpayers will seek to\nbenefit from unlimited SALT deductibility\nbeginning in tax year 2026. If the Federal\ngovernment extends or revises the SALT Cap,\nthe acceleration would likely be substantially\nless, which would reduce tax receipts and\nincrease the budget gap for FY 2027 by a\nconcomitant amount. Lastly, the FY 2028\nprojected budget gap reflects the initial\nimpact of the current law sunset at the end of\ntax year 2027 of higher tax rates for high\nincome filers, reverting the schedule to a\nsingle top rate of 8.82 percent. If the\ncurrent rate schedule were extended, DOB\nestimates that PIT withholding receipts would\nincrease by an amount in the range of $750\nmillion to $1 billion in the last quarter of\nFY 2028. Reserves and Risks The Updated\nFinancial Plan faces looming economic risks,\nincluding: slowing economic growth; continued\nprice inflation; geopolitical uncertainties;\nprogrammatic cost pressures; uncertainty about\nthe fiscal conditions of outside entities\nrelying on State assistance; risks due to the\nState\u2019s dependence on Federal funding and\napprovals; and uncertainty about the timing\nand feasibility of implementing cost savings\nactions.\n\n67\n\nWhile the DOB forecast of receipts and\nspending is based on current law and\nreasonable assumptions as of the time it was\nprepared, the timing and impact of an economic\nslowdown or downturn is highly unpredictable,\nand thus necessitates a prudent level of\nreserves to hedge against these risks. In\nOctober 2021, the Governor committed to\nbuilding the State\u2019s reserves to 15 percent of\nState Operating Funds spending by FY 2025 to\nensure that it could honor its commitments\nthrough good and bad times. This commitment\nwas met two years ahead of schedule in FY 2023\nwith a nearly $11 billion deposit. The FY 2025\nExecutive Budget preserves these critical\ninvestments and utilizes a portion of the\nprojected current year surplus to add $500\nmillion for future costs. FY 2025 General Fund\nFinancial Plan Summary Consistent with\nstatutory requirements, the Governor\u2019s FY 2025\nExecutive Budget provides for balanced\noperations in the General Fund. The Financial\nPlan has been updated to reflect the\nGovernor\u2019s proposed FY 2025 Budget, inclusive\nof savings measures to reduce and offset\nspending growth to levels supportable with\nanticipated resources and to include support\nfor new targeted investments. Spending\nrestraint proposals are targeted at limiting\nspending growth to affordable levels,\nevaluating grants and assistance to ensure\nState assistance is directed to the neediest\nindividuals, organizations, and institutions,\nand realigning service delivery. The Executive\nBudget proposes initiatives and investments\nconsidered essential to addressing mental\nhealth and public safety, preserving the\nstability of the State\u2019s health care system,\nand assisting the City of New York with\nproviding services to asylum seekers. In\naddition, operational funding for all branches\nof State government is increased as agencies\ncontinue to strive to restore service capacity\nand workforce levels to pre-COVID-19 pandemic\nlevels. Lastly, new capital commitments\nproposed in the budget are funded not only\nwith bonds but also with cash resources, to\nensure the State\u2019s debt burden remains\naffordable. The Updated Financial Plan also\nincludes revisions since the Mid-Year Update\nto the Financial Plan to projections of\nreceipts and spending in all years based on\nresults to date, as well as updated forecasts\nand programmatic assumptions. The revisions\ninclude increased receipts expected from tax\ncollections, lottery revenue and mental\nhygiene Federal revenue, as well as lowered\naggregate spending estimates across numerous\nprogram areas and fixed costs. The multi-year\nFinancial Plan also reflects the management of\nsurplus resources generated in prior years and\nadditional resources expected in FY 2024.\nThese management actions include the\nprepayment of expenses due in future years,\nuse of available resources over the multi-year\nplan, and adjustments to the timing of\ntransfers and levels of reserves maintained\nfor operational costs that partly offset\nincreased operational spending estimates.\nReceipts Tax Receipts Based on results through\nDecember 2023 and the updated economic\nforecast, DOB has made upward revisions to the\ntax receipts forecast across all years of the\nUpdated Financial Plan, primarily in PIT and\nPTET. In FY 2025, the estimate for General\nFund tax receipts, excluding PTET, is\nincreased by $1.1 billion. Tax receipts\nestimates for PTET and related PIT credits are\nincreased by $1.6 billion, which is set aside\nin the PTET reserve to cover credits claimed\nin subsequent years. Including these upward\nrevisions, the FY 2025 estimate for tax\nreceipts, excluding PTET, remains roughly $6\nbillion below the level collected in FY 2023.\nThe Executive Budget proposes the following\ntax law changes: \u2022 Permanently Extend the\nItemized Deduction Limit on High Income\nFilers. The Executive Budget proposes to\npermanently extend the itemized deduction\nlimitation on filers with New York Adjusted\nGross Income greater than $10 million, which\nis estimated to provide additional resources\nbeginning in FY 2026. \u2022 Modernize Tax Law to\nInclude the Vacation Rental Industry. The\nExecutive Budget recommends the imposition of\nsales tax on vacation rentals statewide and\nrequires all vacation rental marketplace\nproviders to collect and remit sales taxes on\nall rentals facilitated by their platforms. \u2022\nOther Tax Actions. The Executive Budget also\nproposes to close a loophole related to PIT\nand business taxes, provide for the filing of\namended sales tax returns, and extend other\ntaxes, exemptions and credits, including the\nsales tax exemption on vending machines for an\nadditional year through May 31, 2025.\n\n68\n\nDebt Service Debt service costs are lowered in\nFY 2025 due to refundings and ongoing debt\nmanagement, which lowers dedicated tax\nreceipts needed to support debt service and\nincreases dedicated tax receipts to the\nGeneral Fund. Increased debt service costs in\nFY 2026 and beyond reflect the financing of\nthe proposed capital adds and initiatives\nincluded in the Executive Budget. Other\nReceipts/Transfers Available resources in\nother funds, including upward revisions to\nestimated Mental Hygiene Federal revenue, will\nbe transferred to the General Fund to support\ncontinued and new spending. Disbursements\nAssistance and Grants General Fund spending\nfor assistance and grants is projected to\ntotal $77.4 billion in FY 2025, an increase of\n$3.4 billion (4.6 percent). This spending is\nimpacted by the level of resources outside of\nthe General Fund available to support\nspending, particularly in education and health\nprograms. Compared to the Mid-Year Update to\nthe Financial Plan, assistance and grants\nspending is lowered over the multi-year\nFinancial Plan reflecting reduced growth rates\nand savings achieved through various actions,\nincluding repurposing and reducing certain\nprograms and grants based on need. In\naddition, DOB has revised estimates of\nspending across nearly all functional areas\nbased on programmatic experience and other\nindicators. School Aid. The Updated Financial\nPlan provides $35.3 billion for School Aid in\nSY 2025, an increase of approximately $921\nmillion (2.7 percent), inclusive of the\nState\u2019s full takeover of funding for\nprekindergarten expansion grants previously\nsupported with Federal ARP funds. Excluding\nthe State funds needed to support this\ntakeover, the School Aid increase for SY 2025\ntotals $825 million (2.4 percent). This growth\nreflects a $507 million (2.1 percent)\nFoundation Aid increase driven largely by the\nformula\u2019s inflation factor, which the\nExecutive Budget proposes at 2.4 percent,\nrepresenting the average annual change in the\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) over the last 10\ncalendar years (2014-2023), excluding the\nhighest and lowest years. School Aid growth\nalso fully funds the projected $318 million\nincrease under current law for expense-based\nreimbursement programs. Additionally, this\nincrease reflects the annualization of the\nhistoric $3.0 billion SY 2024 School Aid\nincrease, which was driven primarily by the\nfinal year of the three-year phase in of the\nFoundation Aid formula. Financial Plan\nprojections for SY 2026 and beyond have been\nupdated and are based on estimated growth in\nFoundation Aid and expense-based aids,\nreflecting DOB\u2019s inflation forecast and recent\nannual expense-based aid growth, respectively.\nThese revisions result in lower projected\noutyear spending compared to the Mid-Year\nUpdate to the Financial Plan. Previously,\noutyear Financial Plan estimates assumed\ngrowth in School Aid consistent with the\nestimated ten-year average growth in State\npersonal income. In addition, upward revisions\nto estimated resources available to finance\nSchool Aid spending in the State\u2019s Mobile\nSports Wagering and Video Lottery Terminals\n(VLTs) Funds offset General Fund spending for\nSchool Aid. Medicaid. Medicaid spending in the\nGeneral Fund is projected to increase due to\nmedical cost increases; enrollment remaining\nelevated above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels;\nexpansion of benefits; increases to\nreimbursement rates; and growing aging and\nhigh utilization populations. Other factors\nthat continue to place upward pressure on\nState-share Medicaid costs include, but are\nnot limited to, provider reimbursements to\ncover home health wage increases; the phase-\nout of enhanced Federal funding; increased\ncosts and enrollment growth in managed long-\nterm care; and payments to financially\ndistressed hospitals. The Updated Financial\nPlan includes significant upward revisions to\nreflect updated enrollment and cost forecasts\nconsistent with recent experience and updated\ndata, which increase spending by $8.2 billion\nfrom FY 2025 through FY 2028. In addition, the\nState recently received approval from the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\nfor $6 billion in new Federal funding over\nthree years to help support social, physical,\nand behavioral health care services contingent\non a New York matching commitment of $1.7\nbillion over the same period. The Updated\nFinancial Plan includes the additional State\nresources expected per this agreement. To\ncontrol rising Medicaid costs, the Executive\nBudget includes routine revisions, savings and\nprogram management actions, and savings\nconsistent with increasing State Medicaid\naudit recoveries and efforts to eliminate\ninappropriate payments. Savings actions total\nover $1 billion in FY 2025 and include the\ndiscontinuation of wage parity for the\nConsumer Directed Personal Assistance Program;\nreducing facility capital payments; and\nremoving the 1 percent surplus payments\nprovided to\n\n69\n\nManaged Care Organizations (MCO) attributable\nto the pharmacy benefit transition from the\nMCOs premiums back to Fee for Service\neffective April 2023. Additionally, $100\nmillion in savings is expected from CDPAP and\nMLTC reforms introduced in the 30-Day\nAmendments and $300 million in unallocated\nactions are expected in FY 2025 to achieve\nbalance under the Medicaid Global Cap.\nBeginning in FY 2026, Medicaid spending is\nprojected to exceed the allowable amount under\nthe Global Cap Index. The State will work with\nindustry leaders and stakeholders in the\ncoming months to develop actions that will\nprovide recurring savings. Mental Hygiene. The\nUpdated Financial Plan increases spending for\nmental hygiene consistent with planned\ninvestments and expansions. Increased funding\nto OPWDD includes new services and expands the\nSpecial Olympics in New York State, which\nprovides sports training and competition, free\nhealth screenings, and health education to\nindividuals with intellectual and\ndevelopmental disabilities. The Executive\nBudget also proposes investments in Office of\nMental Health (OMH) including funding for\nsupported housing to account for annual\nproperty-related cost increases, and a 1.5\npercent Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA),\nwhich combined with COLAs provided in the\nprior two years, delivers $1.3 billion to\nOPWDD, OMH, and the Office of Addiction\nServices and Supports (OASAS) voluntary\noperated providers. These increases are offset\nby lower spending that reflects revised\nestimates based on updated information and the\ntiming of implementation of ongoing\ninvestments. Public Health/Aging. The State\nadds funding for various public health\nprograms including for reducing infant, child,\nand maternal mortality and improving maternal\nhealth. Other investments include providing\nadditional funding to the American Indian\nHealth Program (AIHP); increasing Early\nIntervention (El) rates and increasing support\nfor existing school-based health centers.\nThese new investments are partially offset by\nsavings achieved through administrative\nadjustments to allowable claims under the El\nprogram and the discontinuation of certain\nhealth programs administered by DOH that are\nduplicative and/or outside of the core agency\nmission. Social Services/Housing. Social\nservices spending is projected to increase by\nnearly 32 percent on a State Operating Funds\nbasis consistent with planned child care\ninvestments ($863 million) and other\nexpansions. Compared to the Mid-Year Update to\nthe Financial Plan, lower spending reflects\nthe use of available Temporary Assistance for\nNeedy Families (TANF) funding to support\nincreasing child care costs to maintain\ncontinuity in the level and eligibility of\nchild care subsidies. The Executive Budget\nalso proposes to extend permanently the local\nsocial service districts funding for\nresidential school placements of children with\nspecial needs outside the City of New York and\nutilize $95 million of available Mortgage\nInsurance Fund (MIF) resources to fund housing\nand homelessness programs. In addition, the\nExecutive Budget utilizes additional Federal\nassistance to fund child welfare programs by\npermanently increasing the amount local\ndistricts must spend on child welfare by $75\nmillion; providing a 1.5 percent COLA for\nhuman services workers; and continuing\ninvestments in youth employment. Higher\nEducation. Estimated spending for Tuition\nAssistance Program (TAP) awards has been\nrevised downward consistent with lower than\nexpected enrollment levels relative to prior\nprojections, which is partially offset by\nincreased general operating support for CUNY\nsenior colleges related to higher fringe\nbenefits costs. The Executive Budget also\nlimits eligibility for Unrestricted Aid to\nIndependent Colleges and Universities, also\nknown as Bundy Aid, to institutions with\nendowment assets of less than $750 million.\nPublic Safety. The Executive Budget includes\n$120 million to support victims of crime\nfunding which could be impacted by reductions\nin the State\u2019s Federal Victims of Crime Act\n(VOCA) award. The Executive Budget also\nincludes $41 million to prevent and prosecute\ndomestic violence cases, including funding to\nexpand a best practice model that supports\ncollection of evidence-building and\nrelationship building with the victim. In\naddition, the Executive Budget provides $15\nmillion in assistance and grants resources to\nreduce property crime by providing grants to\ndistrict attorney offices and local law\nenforcement. Funding is also included to\nsupport a comprehensive resiliency plan,\nincluding to reduce fatal fires and improve\nemergency preparedness and response. All Other\nAssistance and Grants. Spending is increased\nto reflect extraordinary State funding for\nasylum seeker assistance; a 5.4 percent\nincrease for upstate transit aid; additional\nfunding for various environmental and economic\ndevelopment initiatives and investments, such\nas the Liberty Defense Project and Office of\nNew Americans; pre-paid postage for absentee\nand early mail election ballots; Judiciary\nspending to support court facilities, civil\nlegal aid and technology innovations; and\ncertain accounting reclassifications between\nfinancial plan categories. These increases are\npartly offset by lower spending attributable\nto the expected repayment of $1.1 billion of\nState-only payments from distressed providers;\nplanned discontinuation of the County Wide\nShared Services program; and revised spending\nforecasts across many functional areas,\nreflecting conservative budgeting,\nparticularly in the later years of the\nFinancial Plan.\n\n70\n\nAgency Operations Spending for operations,\nincluding wages and fringe benefits, is\nprojected to increase in FY 2025, excluding\nthe impact of a planned prepayment of FY 2025\npension expenses in the current year, and\nadditional FEMA reimbursements expected to\noffset prior year COVID-19 pandemic related\ncosts. The increased costs reflect general\nsalary increases and expansion of services and\nnew initiatives, including mental health\naccess and capacity, and cybersecurity and\ntechnology investments. The increased spending\nis partly offset with savings expected from\ndownsizing prison capacity, ongoing agency\nefficiencies in delivering services, and\nreduced consultant spending. Agency\nOperations. General Fund operational spending\nis reduced compared to the Mid-Year Update to\nthe Financial Plan to reflect the planned\nreduction of excess prison capacity resulting\nfrom continued prison population declines;\nreductions in consulting services; the\nrestructuring of administrative costs\napplicable to the Environmental Protection\nFund (EPF) activities; improvements in\nprocurement efficiencies; and certain\naccounting reclassifications between financial\nplan categories. In addition, DOB has\nincreased expected FEMA reimbursements, which\nlower reported spending, based on continued\nreview and submission of prior-year eligible\ncosts incurred by multiple agencies. These\nsavings are partly offset by added costs\nrelated to contractual general salary\nincreases, particularly in the later years;\nasylum seeker assistance; investments in\ncybersecurity and information technology;\nexpanded access to inpatient psychiatric and\nmental health services; and continued staffing\nincreases across various agencies to address\npost-COVID-19 pandemic staffing shortages.\nLeglslature/Judiciary. The Executive Budget\nmust include without modification the\nappropriations submitted annually by the\nLegislature and Judiciary. The Updated\nFinancial Plan spending estimates reflect the\nbudget requests submitted by each branch. The\nJudiciary Budget increases annual operating\nspending, including fringe benefits, by $280\nmillion to fund judicial pay raises for State\njudges, general salary increases for non-\njudicial staff, a paid parental leave program,\nstaffing increases to return to pre-COVID-19\npandemic workforce levels, new court clerks\nand attorneys, and costs associated with four\ncourt officer academy classes. In addition,\nthe Judicial budget request includes funding\nto support twenty new judgeships, and twenty-\neight family court and five City of New York\nhousing court judges. Operating spending for\nthe Legislature increases by nearly $4 million\nannually to fund general salary increases for\nlegislative staff. Other Elected Officials.\nAttorney General (AG) operational spending,\nexcluding fringe benefits, is increased by $10\nmillion annually to support increased\ncaseloads driven by recently enacted\nlegislation and general salary increases.\nOperating spending for OSC, excluding fringe\nbenefits, is increased by $5 million annually\nto reflect general salary increases. Fringe\nBenefit/Fixed Costs. Savings in FY 2025\nreflect the planned payment in February 2024\nof the estimated $1.7 billion FY 2025\nEmployees\u2019 Retirement System (ERS) Police and\nFire Retirement System (PFRS) pension bill\nprovided by OSC as of December 2023, which\nincludes estimated interest savings totaling\n$110 million that will accrue to the State.\nAdditional costs have been reflected for the\nproposed elimination of copays for insulin.\nThe Executive Budget includes proposed\nlegislation that would provide relief for\nlocal governments and lower State taxpayer\ncosts by lowering the interest charged on\njudgments against the State from as high as 9\npercent (currently authorized) to a fair\nmarket-based interest rate. The current rate\nwas established in 1982 when interest rates\nwere at 12 percent, to avoid unnecessary\ntaxpayer costs. The recommended rate is in\nline with the interest rate applied to\njudgments in Federal courts and would ensure\nthat neither side in a lawsuit will be\ndisadvantaged by an interest rate above or\nbelow what otherwise could be earned while\ncases are being adjudicated. Additionally, the\nExecutive Budget proposes the State mirror the\nfederal government\u2019s policy decision to have\nhigher-income retirees pay a higher proportion\nof their health insurance costs by ceasing\nIncome-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount\n(IRMAA) reimbursement. Eliminating this\nreimbursement will save the State nearly $24\nmillion annually ($6 million in FY 2025 due to\nthe lag in reimbursement).\n\n71\n\nFinally, the Executive Budget proposes to\nallow interest to accrue for late NYSHIP\npayments from participating employers and\nprovide the ability to withhold funds\nappropriated by the State from participating\nemployers for any amounts past due. The intent\nis to mitigate growing payment arrears which\nresult in increased premiums to the State,\nother NYSHIP employers, and NYSHIP enrollees.\nTransfers to Other Funds General Fund\ntransfers to other funds support capital\nprojects, debt service costs, university\noperations, transportation aid, and a variety\nof other programs. Capital Projects. The\nExecutive Budget reduces transfers from the\nGeneral Fund to capital projects funds, which\nis primarily related to the early retirement\nof bonds that lower the necessary transfer to\nthe DHBTF for debt service. This reduction is\npartially offset by the addition of new\ncapital initiatives that will be supported by\nthe General Fund, including a new electronic\nmedical health records system for OMH and\nadditional funding for Judicial facilities\nrenovation, safety, and technology upgrades\nfor court rooms. SUNY Operating Assistance.\nThe State will provide an additional $8\nmillion to support SUNY operating costs\nrelated to various State of the State\ninitiatives, including, but not limited to,\nfunding for the Empire State Service Corps and\nEmpire Al, in addition to support for the\nState Weather Risk Communication Center at the\nUniversity at Albany and TAP tuition credits.\nAll Other Transfers to Other Funds. The\nExecutive Budget includes $35 million in\nadditional support for DOH health facilities,\nand an increased transfer to the Judiciary\u2019s\nCourt Facilities Incentive Aid Fund for civil\nlegal aid, court facilities\nmaintenance/cleaning costs, and enterprise-\nwide technology enhancements. Additionally, up\nto $100 million of State support is added for\noperating expenses at the State University\nHealth Sciences Center at Brooklyn and/or the\nSUNY Hospital at Brooklyn, pursuant to a\ntransformation plan approved by the Director\nof the Budget. Use of/(Deposit to) Reserves\nChanges to reserves reflect the impact of\nrevised estimates of PTET related tax\nreceipts, updated projections of spending\nsupported by the extraordinary monetary\nsettlements reserve, and management of prior\nyear resources planned to reduce gaps in\nfuture years. In addition, the Financial Plan\npreviously planned to continue annual deposits\nto the reserve for future labor and\noperational costs, however the Updated\nFinancial Plan reflects the discontinuation of\nthe deposits in the outyears consistent with\nthe recognition of additional operational\ncosts and labor agreements reached to date.\nThe existing $3.2 billion reserve is\nmaintained for similar labor agreements with\nunsettled labor unions. Extraordinary State\nFunding for Asylum Seeker Assistance Beginning\nin FY 2024, the State appropriated\nextraordinary funding and support to assist\nNew York City with the humanitarian crisis\nthat has brought thousands of asylum seekers\nto the City of New York. New York State\ncontinues to request Federal assistance to\nmanage thousands of asylum seekers. The State\nmanagement and coordination of the funding and\nassistance spans multiple agencies. The State\nhas staffed personnel at City emergency\nresponse centers and the Division of Military\nand Affairs (DMNA) has deployed hundreds of\nNational Guard members to aid in the crisis\nresponse and provide support. The Office of\nTemporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA)\nadministers reimbursement for short term\nshelter services for migrant individuals and\nfamilies and Safety Net Assistance for asylum\nseekers who are eligible. DOH is supporting\ninfectious disease testing and vaccination\nactivities, as well as providing coverage to\neligible individuals through the State\u2019s\npublic health insurance programs. Other State\nagencies, including the Division of Homeland\nSecurity and Emergency Services (DHSES), the\nDepartment of State (DOS) and the Office of\nGeneral Services (OGS) are assisting nonprofit\norganizations, providing reimbursement for\nFloyd Bennett Field, and supporting case\nmanagement and legal services. In addition,\nthe State is covering the cost of the\nHumanitarian Emergency Response and Relief\nCenter (HERRO) at Floyd Bennett Field and has\nmade multiple State-owned sites available for\nuse as shelters, such as the former Lincoln\nCorrectional Facility in Manhattan, JFK\nBuilding 197, and the Creedmoor Psychiatric\nCenter parking area. In addition to the $1.9\nbillion previously committed as of the Mid-\nYear Update to the Financial Plan, the FY 2025\nExecutive Budget proposal commits an\nadditional $2.4 billion over two years (FY\n2025 and FY 2026). The Governor has pledged to\nuse $500 million from reserves for additional\nsupport.\n\n72\n\nFY 2024 General Fund Current Year Update In\nthe Updated Financial Plan, DOB revised\ncurrent-year estimates for receipts and\nspending in comparison to the Mid-Year Update\nto the Financial Plan. These revisions,\ncombined with the use of the transaction risk\nreserve to offset higher Medicaid spending\n(including delayed provider recoupments) leave\na General Fund surplus of $2.2 billion. DOB\nplans to utilize excess resources to prepay\n$1.7 billion in FY 2025 pension expenses in\nFebruary 2024 pursuant to legislation enacted\nin the FY 2024 Enacted Budget and add $500\nmillion to reserves that is pledged to support\nfuture costs related to asylum seeker\nassistance. Based on the April 2023 tax\nsettlement experience and updated economic\nindicators and forecasts, DOB lowered the\nannual estimates for tax receipts 6 , by\nroughly $5 billion from the February 2023\nforecast, with the reductions concentrated in\nPIT. However, through December 2023, General\nFund receipts, including transfers from other\nfunds, were $855 million higher than estimated\nin the Mid-Year Update to the Financial Plan.\nCollections exceeded the forecast primarily in\nPIT and non-tax receipts. Considering these\nresults, DOB has increased the estimate for\ncurrent year General Fund tax receipts by $890\nmillion and other non-tax receipts by $153\nmillion, reflecting higher license and fees\ncollections, lower debt service and STAR\ncosts, and other revisions. With these\nrevisions, total taxes are still projected to\ndecline by $8.9 billion in FY 2024 from the\nprior year. 6 Excludes PTET. In addition, the\n$2 billion Transaction Risk Reserve has been\nremoved to offset the higher Medicaid spending\nreflected in the Updated Financial Plan.\nGeneral Fund disbursements, including\ntransfers to other funds, were $175 million\nbelow the Mid-Year estimate. While aggregate\nspending was below the cumulative monthly\nestimates, Medicaid spending has consistently\nexceeded the forecast due to higher than\nprojected sustained enrollment levels and the\ntiming of planned health care provider\nrecoupments noted above. In response to\ninitial delays in the Federal approval of\nplanned FY 2022 through FY 2024 State Directed\nPayments (DPT), the State advanced over $1.7\nbillion in State-only payments to distressed\nproviders for immediate cash flow relief. Of\nthe total $1.7 billion, $600 million is\nexpected to be reimbursed by providers in FY\n2024. The remaining provider reimbursements to\nthe State are expected to be delayed,\nresulting in $1.1 billion in additional\nMedicaid spending in FY 2024 that is\nanticipated to be repaid in FY 2025. The\nUpdated Financial Plan reflects the delay,\nwhich drives initial costs in FY 2024 with\nexpected recoupment in FY 2025 via the Mental\nHygiene Stabilization Fund (MHSF), which\nadjusts Office for People with Developmental\nDisabilities (OPWDD)-related local share\nexpenses outside of the Department of Health\n(DOH) Global Cap. This adjustment has with no\nimpact on mental hygiene service delivery or\noperations. In addition, spending is increased\nto reflect a planned $1.7 billion pension\nprepayment. Other savings compared to the Mid-\nYear Update to the Financial Plan include\nincreased Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) and\nother receipts that offset upward revisions to\nMedicaid spending, and other downward\nrevisions to spending projections based on\nresults to date. DOB estimates the General\nFund will end FY 2024 with a closing balance\nof $45 billion. Excluding the PTET reserve for\nthe timing of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve\nfor extraordinary monetary settlements to fund\nexisting liabilities, commitments, and\nprojects, DOB projects the State will end FY\n2024 with a General Fund cash balance of $30\nbillion. General Fund Financial Plan Overview\nGeneral Fund receipts are affected by the\ndeposit of dedicated taxes in other funds for\ndebt service and other purposes, the transfer\nof balances between funds of the State, and\nother factors. Three significant factors\naffect reported General Fund tax receipts, as\ndescribed below. First, changes in debt\nservice on State-supported revenue bonds\naffect General Fund tax receipts. The State\nutilizes bonding programs where tax receipts\nare deposited into dedicated debt service\nfunds (outside the General Fund) and used to\nmake debt service payments. After satisfying\ndebt service requirements for these bonding\nprograms, the balance is transferred to the\nGeneral Fund. Second, the STAR program is\nfunded from PIT receipts, with changes in the\nState-supported cost of the program affecting\nreported PIT receipts. Lastly, beginning in FY\n2022, the PTET program began affecting\nreported General Fund tax collections.\n\n73\n\nGeneral Fund disbursements are affected by the\nlevel of financing sources available in other\nfunds, transfers of balances between funds of\nthe State, and other factors that may change\nannually. For example, education and health\ncare programs are affected by the level of\nfinancing sources ( i.e., HCRA and\nlottery/gaming receipts) available in other\nfunds. Projected spending also reflects DOB\u2019s\ncautious estimates of disbursements, a\npractice that provides a cushion for potential\nreceipts shortfalls and unanticipated costs.\nFY 2025 Executive Budget Financial Plan\nReceipts General Fund receipts, including\ntransfers from other funds, are estimated to\ntotal $106.5 billion in FY 2025, an increase\nof $1.5 billion (1.4 percent) from FY 2024.\nGeneral Fund tax receipts including transfers\nafter payment of debt service are estimated to\ntotal $93.3 billion in FY 2025, an increase of\n$2.2 billion (2.4 percent) from FY 2024\nexcluding the impact of PTET and debt\nprepayments. The increase reflects slow\neconomic growth forecasts which will lead to\nmodest growth in PIT receipts, small growth in\nconsumption taxes and a decrease in business\ntaxes. PIT receipts, excluding PTET and debt\nprepayments, are estimated to total $63\nbillion in FY 2025, an increase of $2.8\nbillion (4.7 percent) from FY 2024. The\nincrease reflects increases in withholding,\ncurrent estimated payments for tax year 2024,\nextension payments for tax year 2023, final\nreturns, and delinquencies. These gross\nreceipts increases are slightly offset by an\nincrease in total refunds, primarily driven by\nthe State/City offset and advanced credit\npayments. Consumption/use tax receipts,\nexcluding debt prepayments, are estimated to\ntotal $18.3 billion in FY 2025, an increase of\n$253 million (1.4 percent) from FY 2024. This\nincrease reflects small growth in the sales\ntax base. Business tax receipts, excluding\nPTET, are estimated at $9.8 billion in FY\n2025, a decrease of $277 million (-2.7\npercent) from FY 2024. The decrease primarily\nreflects an increase in Corporate Franchise\nTax (CFT) refunds partially offset by an\nincrease in CFT and bank tax audit receipts.\nOther tax receipts, including transfers after\npayment of debt service on Clean Water/Clean\nAir (CW/CA) Bonds, are expected to total $2.2\nbillion in FY 2025, a decrease of $577 million\nfrom FY 2024. This is primarily due to the\nexpectation that super-large estate tax\npayments return to more typical trends in FY\n2025. Miscellaneous receipts are projected to\ndecrease by $761 million from FY 2024 mainly\ndue to a reduction in investment income\nattributable to lower forecasted interest\nrates and reserve balances. Non-tax transfers\nin FY 2025 includes a transaction risk reserve\nthat offsets total projected transfers from\nother funds and provides a hedge against risks\nto receipts that may materialize later in the\nfiscal year, which totals $2 billion in FY\n2025. In addition, debt service prepayments\nresulted in the early retirement of bonds that\nlower the debt service costs for the DHBTF by\n$428 million in FY 2025, which lowers the\ntransfer from DHBTF by a commensurate amount.\nExcluding the risk reserve and debt\nprepayments, total non-tax transfers are\nestimated at $3.8 billion in FY 2025, an\nincrease of $125 million from FY 2024 driven\nby transfers from various non-general funds,\nincluding the Indigent Legal Services fund.\nDisbursements General Fund disbursements,\nincluding transfers to other funds, are\nexpected to total $107.6 billion in FY 2025,\nan increase of $4.1 billion (4.0 percent) from\nFY 2024. The annual change in spending is in\nlarge part due to increased funding for\nFoundation Aid, Medicaid, and continued time-\nlimited support to the City of New York for\nasylum seeker assistance. Assistance and\ngrants spending is estimated to total $77.4\nbillion in FY 2025, an increase of $3.4\nbillion from FY 2024. General Fund spending\nfor education and health care represents\nnearly two-thirds of the assistance and grants\nspending growth. General Fund support for\nthese programs is affected by the level of\nfinancing sources (i.e., HCRA and\nlottery/gaming receipts) available in other\nfunds. General Fund support for School Aid is\nestimated to increase by $972 million (3.4\npercent) on a State fiscal year basis,\nreflecting a SY 2025 increase in Foundation\nAid consistent with the ten- year average\nannual change in CPI, excluding the highest\nand lowest years (2.4 percent) and assumed\ngrowth in expense-based reimbursement\nprograms. Additionally, this\n\n74\n\nincrease reflects the annualization of the\nhistoric $3.0 billion SY 2024 School Aid\nincrease, which was driven primarily by the\nfinal year of the three-year phase in of the\nFoundation Aid formula. Medicaid spending is\nprojected to grow by $3.6 billion, primarily\ndue to the $1.6 billion in additional Global\nCap spending allowance to support enrollment\nand escalating MLTC growth and $1.3 billion in\nprior investments to support home health and\npersonal care workers that were initially\nsupported by Home and Community-Based (HCBS)\neFMAP. Other assistance and grants growth is\nprimarily the result of continued State\nsupport of an expanded level and eligibility\nof child care subsidies and victim of crime\nassistance previously funded with Federal\nresources; added child welfare services\nfunding for local social services districts;\nincreased operating support to SUNY and CUNY\nsenior colleges; and additional one-time\nfunding to support asylum seeker assistance in\nthe City of New York. General Fund agency\noperations costs, including fringe benefits,\nare expected to total $21.4 billion in FY\n2025, a decrease of $890 billion from FY 2024,\ndriven primarily by the prepayment of the FY\n2025 pension obligation in FY 2024, partially\noffset by health insurance growth, Judicial\nstaffing and operational increases, and a\nlowered projection of FEMA reimbursements for\nprior year COVID-19 pandemic related eligible\nspending. Excluding the impact of FEMA\nreimbursement, State Operations spending\ngrowth for executive agencies reflects\ninvestments in cybersecurity and information\ntechnology (IT), the cost of deploying the\nNational Guard to assist the City of New York\nwith providing care for asylum seekers and\ncontinued staffing increases across various\nagencies to address post-COVID-19 pandemic\nstaffing shortages. The Judiciary spending\nplan includes a substantial increase in FY\n2025 to support judicial pay raises for State\njudges, general salary increases for non-\njudicial staff, implementing a paid parental\nleave program, staffing increases to return to\npre-COVID-19 pandemic workforce levels, new\ncourt clerks and attorneys, and costs\nassociated with four court officer academy\nclasses. In addition, the Judicial budget\nrequest includes funding for twenty new\njudgeships, twenty-eight family court and five\nCity of New York housing court judges,\nincluding supporting staff for each. Fringe\nbenefit costs are expected to decrease in FY\n2025 primarily due to the prepayment of the FY\n2025 pension obligation in FY 2024, partially\noffset by increased Health Insurance costs.\nExcluding the debt service reclassification\ndescribed above, General Fund transfers to\nOther Funds are projected to total $8.4\nbillion in FY 2025, an increase of $1.2\nbillion from FY 2024. The growth is mainly\nattributable to transfers supporting capital\nprojects driven by the timing of bond proceed\nreimbursements, and the continued use of PAYGO\ncapital to avoid the issuance of high-cost\ntaxable debt. Other transfer increases include\nadditional operating aid for SUNY and\nadditional support to DOH facilities. FY 2025\nClosing Balance Excluding the PTET reserve for\nthe timing of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve\nfor extraordinary monetary settlements to fund\nexisting commitments and projects, DOB\nprojects the State will end FY 2025 with a\nGeneral Fund cash balance of $28.9 billion, a\ndecrease of $1.1 billion from the FY 2024\nclosing balance. The decrease is mainly due to\nthe planned use of debt management reserves,\nand resources made available in the prior year\nto reduce budget gaps, partially offset by a\nplanned increase for the reserve for labor\nsettlements/agency operations. Updated FY 2024\nFinancial Plan Receipts General Fund receipts,\nincluding transfers from other funds, are\nestimated to total $105 billion in FY 2024, an\nincrease of $1.8 billion (1.8 percent) from FY\n2023. General Fund tax receipts including\ntransfers after payment of debt service are\nestimated to total $91.1 billion in FY 2024, a\ndecrease of $9.9 billion (-9.8 percent) from\nFY 2023 excluding the impact of PTET and debt\nprepayments. The decrease reflects the effects\nof softening economic conditions on PIT\nrevenues, in addition to declines in CFT\nreceipts and estate tax receipts. The\nprepayment of debt service due in future years\nreduces reported PIT receipts in the fiscal\nyear in which the payments are made and\nincreases PIT receipts in the fiscal years in\nwhich the debt service was originally\nscheduled to be\n\n75\n\npaid. Debt prepayments reduce General Fund PIT\nreceipts by $4.1 billion in FY 2023 and\nincrease PIT receipts by $3.2 billion in FY\n2024. Including these prepayments, but\nexcluding PTET, tax receipts are estimated to\ndecrease by $1.4 billion from FY 2023. PIT\nreceipts, excluding PTET and debt prepayments,\nare estimated to total $60.2 billion in FY\n2024, a decrease of $9.5 billion (-13.7\npercent) from FY 2023. The decrease reflects\nreduced extension payments for tax year 2022\ndriven by a strong decline in nonwage income,\ncoupled with declines in current estimated\npayments, final returns and delinquencies,\noffset by a decrease in total refunds\nprimarily attributable to the expiration of\nthe 2022 Homeowner Tax Rebate Credit.\nConsumption/use tax receipts, excluding debt\nprepayments, are estimated to total $18\nbillion in FY 2024, an increase of $537\nmillion (3.1 percent) from FY 2023. This\nincrease reflects moderate growth in the sales\ntax base. Business tax receipts, excluding\nPTET, are estimated at $10.1 billion in FY\n2024, a decrease of $286 million (-2.8\npercent) from FY 2023. The decrease primarily\nreflects a decrease in CFT and bank tax audit\nreceipts to recent trend levels. Other tax\nreceipts, including transfers after payment of\ndebt service on CW/CA Bonds, are expected to\ntotal $2.8 billion in FY 2024, a decrease of\n$603 million from FY 2023. This is primarily\ndue to fewer super-large estate tax payments\nbeing received in FY 2024, as well as a\ndecline in real estate transfer tax receipts\nas the market continues to cool off.\nMiscellaneous receipts are projected to\nincrease by $686 million from FY 2023 mainly\ndue to historically high investment income\nreceipts associated with high interest rates\nand large fund balances associated with the\ntiming of PTET receipts. Non-tax transfers are\nestimated to total $4.2 billion in FY 2024, an\nincrease of $868 million from FY 2023. The\nchange is mainly attributable to higher\nprojected transfers from the Health Care\nTransformation, Mental Health Services, Tribal\nState Compact and Indigent Legal Services\nfunds. Disbursements General Fund\ndisbursements, including transfers to other\nfunds, are expected to total $103.5 billion in\nFY 2024, an increase of $10.7 billion (11.5\npercent) from FY 2023. The annual change in\nspending is in large part due to increased\nfunding to fully fund Foundation Aid for\nschools, provide additional funding to\nhospitals, support health care providers and\nworkers, assist the City of New York with the\ninflux of asylum seekers, and expand funding\nfor many other programs and services. In\naddition, eFMAP expired at the end of the\nthird quarter of FY 2024, which has\ntemporarily lowered State-share spending and\nincreased the Federal share of Medicaid costs,\ndriving higher spending in FY 2024.\nFurthermore, in response to initial delays in\nthe Federal approval of planned FY 2022\nthrough FY 2024 State DPT, the State advanced\nover $1.7 billion in State-only payments to\ncertain providers to relieve immediate cash\nflow needs. The provider reimbursements to the\nState are expected to be delayed, resulting in\n$1.1 billion in additional Medicaid spending\n(funded with Financial Plan resources through\nMHSF) in FY 2024 that is expected to be repaid\nin FY 2025. Assistance and grants spending is\nestimated to total $74 billion in FY 2024, an\nincrease of $11.2 billion from FY 2023.\nGeneral Fund spending for education and health\ncare represents nearly half of the assistance\nand grants spending growth. General Fund\nsupport for these programs is affected by the\nlevel of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and\nlottery/gaming receipts) available in other\nfunds. General Fund support for School Aid is\nestimated to increase by $3.2 billion (12.6\npercent) on a State fiscal year basis,\nprimarily reflecting the final year of the\nthree-year phase-in of full funding of the\ncurrent Foundation Aid formula, expansion of\nState-funded full-day prekindergarten\nprogramming for four-year-old children and\nassumed growth in expense-based aids. Medicaid\nspending is projected to grow by $1 billion\ndue to investments in health care and provider\nreimbursement associated with the\nauthorization to increase the State\u2019s minimum\nwage, offset by savings resulting from the\ntransition of the pharmacy benefit from\nManaged Care to Medicaid Fee-for-Service, the\nphase down of the eFMAP extension through\nDecember 31, 2023, and actions to maintain\nspending within the Global Cap. Other\nassistance and grants growth is primarily the\nresult of additional assistance to the MTA to\naddress operating shortfalls, initiatives and\ninvestments to improve mental health care\nservices, expanded access to affordable\nhousing, additional support for public safety\ninitiatives, wage increases, emergency rental\nand rental arrears assistance and landlord aid\nprograms,\n\n76\n\nincluding legal services for tenants facing\neviction, and a significant level of one-time\nfunding to support asylum seeker assistance in\nthe City of New York. General Fund agency\noperations costs, including fringe benefits,\nare expected to total $22.3 billion in FY\n2024, an increase of $641 million from FY\n2023, driven primarily by the prepayment of\nthe FY 2025 pension obligation in February\n2024, partially offset by FEMA reimbursements\nfor prior year COVID-19 pandemic related\neligible spending. State Operations spending\ngrowth for executive agencies reflects efforts\nto modernize health reporting systems, conduct\nadditional State Police recruiting classes,\nincrease inpatient beds in State-operated\nPsychiatric Centers, and provide additional\nenforcement to curb the illegal sale of\ncannabis. Additionally, the cost of deploying\nthe National Guard to assist the City of New\nYork with providing care for asylum seekers.\nJudiciary spending is projected to increase in\nFY 2024 driven by increases to the assigned\ncounsel rate for attorneys providing services\nto indigent persons. Fringe benefit costs are\nexpected to increase in FY 2024 primarily due\nto the pension prepayment in FY 2024 and\nincreased costs of providing health and\npension benefits to current and retired\nemployees. These increases were partially\noffset by a $920 million payment to the\nRetiree Health Benefit Trust Fund (RHBTF) and\nthe advancement of certain health insurance\npayments in FY 2023. General Fund transfers to\nOther Funds are projected to total $7.2\nbillion in FY 2024, a decrease of $1.1 billion\nfrom FY 2023. The decline is mainly\nattributable to routine delays and lower\nspending for capital projects funded with\nGeneral Fund resources, as well as the timing\nof bond proceed reimbursements, and lower\nHealth Care Transformation and Dedicated Mass\nTransportation Trust Fund transfers. These\ndeclines are partially offset by increased\ntransfers to SUNY for transformational\ninitiatives at campuses that support\ninnovation, help meet workforce needs, and\nprovide student support. FY 2024 Closing\nBalance Excluding the PTET reserve for the\ntiming of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve for\nextraordinary monetary settlements to fund\nexisting commitments and projects, DOB\nprojects the State will end FY 2024 with a\nGeneral Fund cash balance of $30 billion, an\nincrease of $2.5 billion from the FY 2023\nclosing balance. The increase is mainly due to\nresources set aside for asylum seeker\nassistance, a planned increase for the\nreserves for labor settlements/agency\noperations and additional net resources\nexpected to be available at year-end that are\ncarried forward to reduce the budget gaps in\nsubsequent years. The Pandemic Assistance\nReserve is expected to be exhausted in FY 2024\nto fund planned commitments delayed from prior\nyears. Cash Flow State Finance Law authorizes\nthe General Fund to borrow money temporarily\nfrom available funds held in the Short-Term\nInvestment Pool (STIP). Loans to the General\nFund are limited to a term not to exceed four\nmonths or the end of the fiscal year,\nwhichever is shorter. The resources that can\nbe borrowed by the General Fund are limited to\navailable balances in STIP, as determined by\nOSC. Available balances include money in the\nState\u2019s governmental funds and a relatively\nsmall amount of other money belonging to the\nState that is held in internal service and\nenterprise funds, as well as certain agency\nfunds. Several accounts in Debt Service Funds\nand Capital Projects Funds that are part of\nAll Governmental Funds are excluded from the\nbalances deemed available in STIP. These\nexcluded funds consist of bond proceeds and\nmoney obligated for debt service payments. The\nExecutive Budget continues to authorize short-\nterm financing for liquidity purposes during\nthe fiscal year. In doing so, it provides a\ntool to help the State manage cashflow, if\nneeded, and more effectively deploy resources.\nSpecifically, the authorization allows for the\nissuance of up to $4 billion of PIT revenue\nanticipation notes which mature no later than\nMarch 31 of the fiscal year in which they are\nissued. Borrowed amounts may not be extended\nor refinanced beyond the initial maturity. The\nUpdated Financial Plan does not assume the use\nof short-term financing for liquidity purposes\nduring FY 2025. DOB evaluates cash results\nregularly and may adjust the use of notes\nbased on liquidity needs, market\nconsiderations, and other factors. DOB expects\nthat the General Fund will have sufficient\nliquidity in FY 2025 to make all planned\npayments as they become due. The State\ncontinues to reserve money on a quarterly\nbasis for debt service payments financed with\nGeneral Fund resources. Money to pay debt\nservice on bonds secured by dedicated\nreceipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax\nRevenue bonds, continues to be set aside as\nrequired by law and bond covenants. PTET\nFinancial Plan Impact\n\n77\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury)\nand the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have\ndetermined that State and local income taxes\nimposed on and paid by a partnership or an S\ncorporation on its income, such as the PTET,\nare allowable as a Federal deduction to\ntaxable income. In November 2020, the IRS\nreleased Notice 2020-75, which announced that\nthe Treasury and IRS intend to issue\nclarifying regulations with respect to such\npass-through taxes. As part of the State\u2019s\ncontinuing response to Federal tax law\nchanges, legislation was enacted in FY 2022 to\nallow an optional PTET on the New York-sourced\nincome of partnerships and S corporations.\nQualifying entities that elect to pay PTET pay\na tax of up to 10.9 percent on their taxable\nincome at the partnership or corporation\nlevel, and their individual partners, members\nand shareholders receive a refundable PIT\ncredit equal to the proportionate or pro rata\nshare of taxes paid by the electing entity.\nAdditionally, the program includes a resident\ntax credit that allows for reciprocity with\nother states that have implemented\nsubstantially similar taxes, which currently\nincludes Connecticut and New Jersey. DOB\nexpects that the PTET will, on a multi-year\nbasis, be revenue neutral for the State.\nHowever, because the PTET credits are not\nnecessarily realized by taxpayers within the\nsame fiscal year that PTET revenue is received\nby the State, the PTET will not be revenue-\nneutral to the State within each fiscal year.\nThe Updated Financial Plan includes an\nestimate for PTET within business taxes and\nthe corresponding decrease in PIT receipts. It\nis expected that the tax benefit accompanying\nthe PTET program will end in 2025 due to the\nscheduled expiration of the SALT deduction cap\nunder current Federal law. Therefore, the\nestimates in the Updated Financial Plan\nreflect the assumption that entities cease to\nparticipate in the later years of the\nFinancial Plan period. In December 2021,\nelecting entities began making estimated PTET\npayments that were classified as business\ntaxes and totaled $16.4 billion in FY 2022.\nThe entire amount was set aside for purposes\nof offsetting the decrease in PIT receipts in\nFY 2023 and beyond. A portion of the reserve\nbalance will cover the difference between PTET\ncollections and related PIT credits and is\nexpected to be depleted when the program\nutilization ceases. In tax year 2021,\ntaxpayers could not reduce their current\nestimated PIT payments for PTET, because\nenrollment in the PTET was not completed until\nlate 2021 and affected taxpayers were not\nstatutorily authorized to do so. PIT credits\nmay be claimed on the tax return in the\nfollowing fiscal year, or they can be\nreflected sooner through reductions in\nestimated payments. Taxpayers recognized a\nsubstantial portion of PTET PIT credits\nthrough current estimated payments beginning\ntax year 2022. The State estimates that\nsimilar behavior occurred in tax year 2023 and\nthis behavior is expected to reoccur in future\nyears. FY 2023 PIT collections were reduced by\ncredits for most tax year 2021 PTET\ncollections (through extensions and refunds)\nand a portion of tax year 2022 PTET\ncollections (through reductions in current\nestimated PIT payments). The State estimates\nthat FY 2024 PIT collections will be reduced\nby credits attributable to PTET collections\nfor tax years 2021 through 2023. In FY 2025,\nthe State expects to continue to collect PTET\nand pay PIT credits connected with the program\nfor tax years 2022 through 2024. State\nOperating Funds Spending Summary State\nOperating Funds encompass the General Fund and\na wide range of State activities funded from\nrevenue sources outside the General Fund,\nincluding dedicated tax revenues, tuition,\nincome, fees, and assessments. Many activities\nfunded with these dedicated revenue sources\noften have no direct bearing on the State\u2019s\nability to maintain a balanced budget in the\nGeneral Fund but are captured in State\nOperating Funds. Certain financing sources\navailable in other funds support spending that\nimpacts General Fund disbursements as revenues\nfluctuate. For example, education and health\ncare programs are affected by the level of\nfinancing sources (i.e., HCRA and\nlottery/gaming receipts) available in other\nfunds. Assistance and Grants Nearly three-\nquarters of State spending is for assistance\nand grants that include payments to local\ngovernments, school districts, health care\nproviders, managed care organizations, and\nother entities, as well as financial\nassistance to, or on behalf of, individuals,\nfamilies, and not-for-profit organizations.\nSchool Aid and Medicaid account for\napproximately half of total State Operating\nFunds spending. Over the past three years,\nassistance and grants funding has increased\nsubstantially with enhanced funding for\neducation, health care and nearly all other\nprograms, as well a significant amount of\nspending for time-limited asylum seeker\nassistance.\n\n78\n\nSchool Aid spending for SY 2025 is estimated\nat $35.3 billion, representing an annual\nincrease of $921 million (2.7 percent),\ninclusive of the State\u2019s full takeover of\nfunding for prekindergarten expansion grants\npreviously supported with Federal ARP funds.\nThis annual growth is primarily driven by\nincreased funding for Foundation Aid ($507\nmillion), reflecting the use of the ten-year\naverage growth rate in the consumer price\nindex (2.4 percent), increased support for\nexpense based reimbursement programs and\nadditional support for the State takeover of\nUniversal Prekindergarten (UPK) and Statewide\nUniversal Full-Day Prekindergarten (SUFPK)\nexpansion grants that were initially supported\nwith Federal ARP Elementary and Secondary\nSchool Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds. DOH\nMedicaid assistance and grants spending,\nexcluding the effect of the temporary eFMAP,\nis estimated at $30.4 billion in FY 2025, an\nannual increase of 10.9 percent. Medicaid\ncosts reported under the Global Cap are\nprojected to increase by $1.6 billion in FY\n2025, consistent with the updated growth\nindex. Higher spending is attributable to\nincreased MLTC enrollment and price growth as\nwell as increased home and personal care\nutilization and costs, expanded access to\nhealth coverage, and higher provider\nreimbursements. The remaining growth is\nattributable to costs reported outside of the\nGlobal Cap and is mainly driven by home care\nand minimum wage for health care providers\n($1.3 billion) and financial relief to\ncounties and the City of New York associated\nwith full coverage of the local share of\nspending growth ($183 million). A portion of\nMedicaid-related expenses of OPWDD will be\nfunded outside of the DOH Global Cap to\nprovide spending room for State DPT payments\nand concurrent recoupments in FY 2025. State\nMedicaid spending is also affected by the\nFederal government\u2019s increased share of\nMedicaid funding through eFMAP. The estimated\nState benefit of the eFMAP in FY 2024 is $1.7\nbillion. State-share savings from eFMAP have\nand continue to be used to offset increased\ncosts associated with persistently elevated\nCOVID-19 pandemic related enrollment, asylum\nseeker assistance, and lost Medicaid Redesign\nTeam II (MRT II) savings due to Federal\nrestrictions regarding program restructuring\nwhile the eFMAP remained in place. These costs\nand most of the eFMAP are outside of the\nGlobal Cap and are funded through the Mental\nHygiene Stabilization Fund. Mental Hygiene\nspending growth provides increased support for\ntargeted investments in services to ensure\nindividuals with developmental disabilities,\nmental illness, substance use disorders and\nproblem gambling have appropriate access to\ncare. The increases in funding include a 1.5\npercent human services COLA, investing in\nsupported housing to account for annual\nproperty-related cost increases, new service\nopportunities for people with intellectual and\ndevelopmental disabilities, and expanding the\nSpecial Olympics in New York State.\nTransportation spending is projected to\ndecrease due to one-time funding to the MTA in\nFY 2024 to address extraordinary financial\nimpacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,\npartially offset by a projected increase in\ndedicated transit and General Fund aid. Social\nServices spending increases are mainly driven\nby and funding for services and assistance to\nthe City of New York for asylum seekers. Other\ninvestments include increased funding for\nchild care, the Empire State Supportive\nHousing Initiative (ESSHI), Child Welfare,\nPublic Assistance, Supplemental Security\nIncome, Safety Net Assistance, Rent\nSupplement, After School Programs and a 1.5\npercent COLA for eligible programs. Spending\nfor emergency rental assistance and landlord\naid programs are expected to decline in FY\n2025 as the programs wind down. Higher\neducation spending is projected to grow by 3.6\npercent in FY 2025, primarily reflecting the\ncontinued expansion of TAP for part-time\nstudents in degree-granting programs as well\nas students enrolled in nondegree workforce\ncredentialing programs at public institutions,\nincreased operating support for CUNY senior\ncolleges and the projected disbursement of the\nState endowment match to SUNY University\nCenters. Increased funding for All Other\nEducation Programs in FY 2025 is largely\ndriven by the Executive Budget\u2019s inclusion of\n$100 million for Supplemental Assistance\nGrants to provide additional aid to school\ndistricts for SY 2025. Growth also reflects\nthe continued impact of a 6.25 percent SY 2024\nCOLA for special education program tuition\nrates, the return of program enrollments to\npre-COVID- 19 pandemic levels and continuation\nof the State-funded initiative to incentivize\nqualifying low- income public and nonpublic\nschools to participate in the Community\nEligibility Provision (CEP) program, allowing\nall students in those schools to eat breakfast\nand lunch at no charge regardless of their\nfamilies\u2019 income. The decline in other\nassistance and grants spending is due mainly\nto the expected delay of provider\nreimbursements of State DPT to the State,\nresulting in $1.1 billion in additional\nspending in FY 2024 that is expected to be\nrepaid in FY 2025; one-time funding for Health\ncare and Direct care workers bonuses (both\nfunded with Financial Plan resources through\nMHSF); and a nonrecurring investment in energy\naffordability. This decline is partially\noffset by additional funding for public\nhealth,\n\n79\n\nincluding CHP; State support for victim of\ncrime assistance previously funded with\nFederal resources; dedicated resources to\ncombat retail theft; domestic violence\ninitiatives; Indigent Legal Services (ILS);\nand State matching funds provided under the\nPublic Campaign Finance program. State\nOperations/GSCs Operating costs for State\nagencies include salaries, wages, fringe\nbenefits, and Non-Personal Service (NPS) costs\n(e.g., supplies, utilities) and comprise about\na quarter of State Operating Funds spending.\nGrowth in operational spending for executive\nagencies is driven primarily by investments in\ncybersecurity and information technology, the\ncost of deploying the National Guard to assist\nthe City of New York with providing care for\nasylum seekers, and modest staffing increases\nacross various agencies. Federal reimbursement\nfor prior year State costs incurred for\nCOVID-19 pandemic response and recovery\nefforts is projected to decline year over\nyear. University systems spending growth in FY\n2025 reflects projected increases in recurring\noperating aid support for SUNY State-operated\ncampuses, additional support for operating\nexpenses at the State University Health\nSciences Center at Brooklyn and/or the SUNY\nHospital at Brooklyn, as well as funding for\nthe Empire State Service Corps, SUNY\u2019s share\nof the NY SWIMS initiative, micro-credential\nprograms, the State Weather Risk Communication\nCenter, and operating costs for SUNY\u2019s\nparticipation in the Empire Al consortium. In\naddition to tuition and fee revenue, the State\nprovides direct operating support to SUNY\nannually via a transfer from the General Fund,\ntotaling approximately $1.4 billion in FY\n2025, and pays the fringe benefit costs of\nemployees at SUNY State-operated campuses,\nwhich is projected to total $1.9 billion in FY\n2025. The State also continues to pay a share\nof the debt service costs on bond financed\ncapital projects at SUNY which is projected to\ntotal approximately $612 million in FY 2025.\nJudiciary spending growth of 7.6 percent is\ndriven by staffing requests to fund judicial\npay raises for State judges, general salary\nincreases for non-judicial staff, twenty new\njudgeships, twenty-eight family court judges,\nfive City of New York housing judges, as well\nas new support staff and other staffing\ninitiatives aimed at returning fills to pre-\nCOVID-19 pandemic levels, including new court\nclerks and attorneys. The Judiciary also\nrequested funding to hold four court officer\nacademy classes, implement a paid parental\nleave program, increase support for child and\ncivil legal service providers, expand mental\nhealth court services, support several anti-\nbias and justice initiatives, accommodate\ncourt facility cleaning costs, and provide for\nhealth insurance and pension cost increases.\nThe operating costs for the offices of\nindependently elected officials (Attorney\nGeneral, Comptroller, and Legislature) are\nprojected to grow by 4.4 percent. This growth\nis driven by payments for salary increases\npursuant to existing contracts, increased\nstaffing to support increased caseloads caused\nby recently enacted legislation and general\nsalary increases for legislative staff. The\ndecline in General State Charges (GSCs) is due\nmainly to the planned prepayment of FY 2025\npension obligations in February 2024,\npartially offset by growth in health insurance\ncosts, attributed to the rising cost of health\ncare and prescription drugs. OTHER MATTERS\nAFFECTING THE FINANCIAL PLAN Federal Risks The\namount and composition of Federal funds\nreceived by the State have changed over time\nbecause of legislative and regulatory actions\nat the Federal level and will likely continue\nto change. Congress has and is expected to\ncontinue to need to act to increase or suspend\nthe debt limit to avoid delaying payments\nand/or defaulting on debt obligations. The\nUpdated Financial Plan may also be adversely\naffected by other Federal government actions\nincluding audits, disallowances, changes to\nFederal participation rates or other Medicaid\nrules, and discretionary spending reductions.\nIn addition, the Updated Financial Plan\nassumes Federal reimbursement of previously\nincurred pandemic response and recovery costs.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that FEMA\nwill approve claims for the State to receive\nreimbursement in the amounts or in the State\nfiscal years projected in the Updated\nFinancial Plan. Debt Limit. A Federal\ngovernment default on payments, particularly\nfor a prolonged period, could have a\nmaterially adverse effect on national and\nstate economies, financial markets, and\nintergovernmental aid payments. Specific\neffects on the Updated Financial Plan\nresulting from a future Federal government\ndefault are unknown and impossible to predict.\nHowever,\n\n80\n\ndata from past economic downturns suggests\nthat the State\u2019s revenue loss could be\nsubstantial if there was an economic downturn\ndue to a Federal default. A payment default by\nthe Federal government may also adversely\naffect the municipal bond market. Municipal\nissuers, including the State and its public\nauthorities and localities, could face higher\nborrowing costs and impaired access to capital\nmarkets. This would jeopardize planned capital\ninvestments and projects. Additionally, the\nmarket for, and market value of, outstanding\nmunicipal obligations, including municipal\nobligations of the State and its public\nauthorities, could be adversely affected. Aid\nReductions. Any significant reductions in\nFederal aid could have a materially adverse\nimpact on the Updated Financial Plan. Health\ncare and human services receive significant\nFederal funding and may be particularly\naffected by potential changes in Federal aid.\nFederal funding for Medicaid is subject to\nreview by CMS every five years and is\ncurrently extended through March 31, 2027,\nwhich supports the Medicaid Managed Care\nPrograms, Children\u2019s HCBS, and self-direction\nof personal care services. In September 2022,\nthe State requested $13.5 billion in new\nFederal Medicaid funding, over a five-year\nperiod, to address health disparities\nexacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. On\nJanuary 9, 2024, CMS approved a $6 billion\nwaiver over a three-year term in response to\nthe State\u2019s request. The funding will enable\nNew York to help support social, physical, and\nbehavioral health care services throughout the\nState. However, the anticipated agreement\nrequires a total of $1.7 billion in additional\nState resources, which have been assumed in\nthe Updated Financial Plan over the same\nperiod. Given the time limit on the Federal\nfunding, these services will be discontinued\nat the end of the term absent an extension by\nthe Federal government. Accordingly, there is\nno State or Federal funding included in the\nUpdated Financial Plan projections beyond the\nterm period. Financial Plan Projections The\nUpdated Financial Plan projections and the\nassumptions they are based on are subject to a\nmyriad of risks, including, but not limited\nto, economic, social, financial, political,\npublic health, and environmental risks and\nuncertainties. The projections of receipts and\ndisbursements in the Updated Financial Plan\nare based on reasonable assumptions at the\ntime they were prepared. DOB is unable to\nprovide any assurance that actual results will\nnot differ materially and adversely from these\nprojections. Receipts. State tax collections\nare economically sensitive and are affected by\nthe condition of the State and national\neconomies, as well as Federal tax law changes.\nUncertainties and risks that may affect the\neconomic and receipts forecasts include, but\nare not limited to: national and international\nevents; inflation; consumer confidence;\ncommodity prices; supply chain disruptions;\nmajor terrorist events; hostilities or war;\nclimate change and extreme weather events;\nsevere epidemic or pandemic events;\ncybersecurity events; Federal laws and\nregulations; financial sector compensation;\ncapital gains; and monetary policy affecting\ninterest rates and the financial markets. The\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made\nmajor changes to the Federal Internal Revenue\nCode, most of which were effective in tax year\n2018. The TCJA made extensive changes to\nFederal PIT, corporate income taxes, and\nestate taxes. One key impact of the TCJA on\nNew York State taxpayers is the $10,000 limit\non the deductibility of SALT payments, which,\nuntil its scheduled expiration after 2025,\nrepresents a large increase in the State\u2019s\neffective tax rate relative to historical\nexperience. The Updated Financial Plan\nestimates of tax receipts assume the SALT\ndeduction cap is not extended or modified\nafter 2025. The projection of non-tax receipts\nand other available resources assumes various\ntransactions will occur as planned, including,\nbut not limited to: receipt of Federal aid;\ncertain payments from public authorities;\nrevenue sharing payments under the Tribal-\nState Compacts; and the collection of fines,\nfees and other receipts at levels to support\noperations, offset General Fund costs and\ntransfer of available fund balances to the\nGeneral Fund. It should be noted that General\nFund Medicaid and School Aid spending remains\nsensitive to revenue performance that finance\na portion of these program costs.\nDisbursements. Projections and timing of\ndisbursements are subject to many of the same\nrisks listed above for receipts, as well as\nassumptions which may have additional risks\nincluding, but not limited to: the level of\nwage and benefit increases for State\nemployees; changes in the size of the State\u2019s\nworkforce; factors affecting the State\u2019s\nrequired pension fund contributions; the\navailability of Federal reimbursement,\nincluding Federal COVID-19 pandemic emergency\nassistance; the receipt of Federal approvals\nnecessary to implement the Medicaid savings\nactions; unanticipated growth in public\nassistance programs, including the assumed\nlevel of utilization of newly expanded\nbenefits; the ability of the State to\nimplement cost\n\n81\n\nreduction initiatives, including reductions in\nState agency operations, when established, and\nthe success with which the State controls\nexpenditures; and the ability of the State and\nits public authorities to issue securities\nsuccessfully in public credit markets. Some of\nthese issues are described in more detail\nherein. Public Health Insurance\nPrograms/Public Assistance. Historically, the\nState has experienced growth in Medicaid\nenrollment and public assistance caseloads\nduring economic downturns due mainly to\nincreases in unemployment. Many people who\nwere laid off or otherwise experienced a\ndecrease in family income in 2020 and 2021 due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic became qualifying\nenrollees and began to participate in public\nhealth insurance programs such as Medicaid,\nEP, and CHP. Due to Federal requirements,\nparticipants in these programs remained\neligible for coverage for 12 continuous months\nregardless of changes in employment or income\nlevels that may otherwise make them\nineligible. Beginning in June of 2023, the\nState resumed eligibility redeterminations for\napproximately 9 million public health\ninsurance enrollees to be completed over a\nfourteen-month period, consistent with CMS\nrequirements. Based on experience to date,\ndisenrollment is expected to be significantly\nless than initially projected and the State is\nexpected to retain a greater proportion of\nCOVID-19 era enrollees than other states. The\nState estimates over 600,000 people will\nremain enrolled relative to pre-COVID-19\npandemic levels of enrollment. Currently, only\nnon-citizens with certain immigration statuses\nare eligible for Federal and/or State\nbenefits, including those Permanently Residing\nUnder Color of Law (PRUCOL). While the term\nPRUCOL is not an immigration status, it is a\npublic benefit category used by the Office of\nTemporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) for\nthe purposes of determining eligibility for\nSafety Net Assistance and by DOH for\ndetermining Medicaid eligibility. Recent\nadministrative actions taken to align the OTDA\nand DOH definitions of PRUCOL are expected to\nresult in more households becoming eligible\nfor Safety Net Assistance and increase State\ncosts. Extraordinary Aid to Hospitals. The\nState provides a substantial amount of\nsupplemental funding to all hospitals beyond\ntraditional Medicaid rates and payments\nthrough various programs and grants, including\nthe Vital Access Provider Assurance Program,\nValue-Based Quality Improvement Program,\nGraduate Medical Education Incentive Pool, and\nvarious other pools. Currently, 75 of 261 New\nYork hospitals (29 percent) are financially\ndistressed - a 200 percent increase from FY\n2017 that has driven a concomitant 432 percent\nincrease in Federal/State fiscal assistance to\nthese entities. Many hospitals responsible for\nsupporting medical needs in underserved\ncommunities across the State, including those\nwith higher rates of uninsured individuals and\ngovernment payor mix, have been further\nstressed financially due to the pandemic.\nDespite hospitals in the State receiving\nroughly $11 billion in COVID-19 pandemic\nrelated assistance paid by the Federal\ngovernment, many continue to struggle. To\nstrengthen the financial position of certain\nfinancially distressed providers, the State\nhas provided substantial one-time funding to\ncertain facilities on top of the $984 million\nin ongoing annual base support provided in\naggregate to all hospitals statewide. An\nadditional $800 million was provided in FY\n2023 ($100 million recurring) and another $500\nmillion in FY 2024. The importance of the\nhospital industry to local communities for\npurposes of accessing critical health care\nservices, as well as other social and economic\nbenefits, creates the potential for increased\ncost pressure within the Financial Plan should\nthe State continue to assist hospitals. There\ncan be no assurance that the State will not\ncontinue to commit to additional funding, as\nmany facilities, including those which are not\ncurrently fiscally distressed, continue to\nseek State support. Opioid Settlement Fund.\nThe Attorney General and DFS have reached\nsignificant opioid related settlements with\nseveral corporations for their roles in\nhelping fuel the opioid epidemic. As a result\nof the settlements, the State and its\nsubdivisions are expected to receive payments\nover multiple years extending through 2040\nwhich total more than $2.7 billion. A portion\nof this total will be paid directly to\nlocalities under the terms of the settlements,\nwith the remainder paid to the State. The\nFinancial Plan will be updated pending\nconfirmation of the timing and value of the\nshare of the settlements that the State will\nreceive. The State\u2019s share of these\nsettlements will be deposited into the Opioid\nSettlement Fund pursuant to Chapter 190 of the\nLaws of 2021, as amended by Chapter 171 of the\nLaws of 2022. Money within the Opioid\nSettlement Fund will be used to supplement\nfunding for substance use disorder prevention,\ntreatment, recovery, and harm reduction\nservices or programs and/or for payments to\nlocal governments pursuant to such settlements\nor judgments. Detailed descriptions of prior\nsettlements are available in previous\nFinancial Plan publications. Litigation Risk.\nThe Updated Financial Plan forecast is subject\nto litigation risk. Litigation against the\nState may challenge the constitutionality of\nvarious actions with fiscal implications.\nFurthermore, certain adverse decisions may not\nmeet the\n\n82\n\nmateriality threshold to warrant a description\nin the AIS Update but, in the aggregate, could\nstill negatively affect the forecasts and\nprojections contained in the Updated Financial\nPlan. Financial Plan Risk Management. In\ndeveloping the Financial Plan, DOB attempts to\nmitigate financial risks, with an emphasis on\nthe General Fund. It does this by, among other\nthings, exercising caution when calculating\ntotal General Fund disbursements and managing\nthe accumulation of financial resources. Such\nresources include but are not limited to: fund\nbalances that are not needed each year;\nreimbursement for capital advances; and\nprepayment of expenses, subject to available\nresources, to maintain budget flexibility. DOB\nroutinely executes cash management actions to\nmanage the State\u2019s large and complex budget.\nThese actions are intended to improve the\nState\u2019s cash flow, manage resources within and\nacross State fiscal years, adhere to spending\ntargets, and better position the State to\naddress unanticipated costs, including\neconomic downturns, revenue deterioration, and\nunplanned expenses. There is no guarantee that\nsuch financial resources or cash management\nactions will be sufficient to address risks\nthat may materialize in a given fiscal year.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that\nthe State\u2019s financial position will not change\nmaterially and adversely from current\nprojections. If this were to occur, the State\nmay be required to take additional gap-closing\nactions to preserve General Fund balance. Such\nactions may include but are not limited to:\nreductions in State agency operations; delays\nor reductions in payments to local governments\nor other recipients of State aid; delays in or\nsuspension of capital maintenance and\nconstruction; extraordinary financing of\noperating expenses; and use of non-recurring\nresources. In some cases, the ability of the\nState to implement such actions requires the\napproval of the Legislature and cannot be\nimplemented solely by the Governor. Statutory\nGrowth Caps for School Aid and Medicaid In FY\n2012, the State began utilizing spending\ngrowth caps intended to limit the year-to-year\ngrowth in the State\u2019s two largest assistance\nand grants programs, School Aid and Medicaid.\nSchool Aid. The School Aid growth cap is\nintended to establish a limit on the growth in\nSchool Aid so that it will not exceed the\nannual growth in State Personal Income, as\ncalculated in the Personal Income Growth Index\n(PIGI). The statutory PIGI for School Aid is\nbased on the average annual income growth over\na ten-year period. However, the authorized\nSchool Aid increases have generally exceeded\nthe indexed levels in recent years. Over the\npast three years, School Aid increases have\nsubstantially exceeded the PIGI, consistent\nwith the State\u2019s commitment to phase in full\nfunding of the Foundation Aid formula. Driven\nprimarily by the final year of this phase-in,\nthe SY 2024 increase of $3.0 billion (9.4\npercent) was substantially above the indexed\nPIGI rate of 4.2 percent. The proposed\nincrease in State-funded School Aid for SY\n2025 of $921 million (2.7 percent) is below\nthe indexed PIGI rate of 3.7 percent.\nProjections for SY 2026 and beyond assume that\nSchool Aid growth will be limited to less than\nthe PIGI rate and are based on estimated\ngrowth in Foundation Aid and expense-based\naids. Medicaid. Over 80 percent of DOH State\nFunds Medicaid spending growth is subject to\nthe Global Cap that is intended to establish a\nlimit for Medicaid growth. Additional State-\nshare Medicaid spending, outside of the Global\nCap, includes State costs for the takeover of\nMedicaid growth from local governments and\nreimbursement to providers for increased\nminimum wage costs. Prior to FY 2023, the\nGlobal Cap was previously calculated using the\nten-year rolling average of the medical\ncomponent of the CPI for all urban consumers\nand thus allowed for growth attributable to\nincreasing costs, though not increasing\nutilization. To accommodate growth in factors\nnot indexed under the prior Global Cap,\nbeginning in FY 2023, the allowable spending\ngrowth for activities under the Global Cap is\nset at the five-year rolling average of health\ncare spending, using projections from the CMS\nActuary. The CMS Actuary updates the\nprojections annually and DOB incorporates the\nrevisions into the multi-year forecast with\nthe Executive Budget. The new Global Cap index\nadded a substantial amount of allowable\nMedicaid growth - over $16 billion covering\nthe six-year period from FY 2023 through FY\n2028. Medicaid spending is largely driven by\nthe aging population\u2019s utilization of the\nState\u2019s MLTC program and other programs\nserving seniors and dual eligibles. This\ncombined population comprises roughly 60\npercent of total Medicaid Global Cap spending\nand is expected to rise to nearly 70 percent\nby 2028 as the aging of the baby boomer\npopulation continues to grow the 65+ age\ncohort. The 65+ age cohort is projected to\nmove from 9 percent of the overall State\npopulation in 2000 to 23 percent by 2030. This\nis expected to place a substantial amount of\npressure on the Global Cap limit. There can be\nno assurance that costs will not exceed\nprojections in the later years of the Updated\nFinancial Plan absent savings and/or rate\nreductions. The statutory provisions of the\nGlobal Cap grant the Commissioner of Health\n(the \u201c Commissioner \u201d ) certain powers to\nlimit Medicaid disbursements to the level\nauthorized by the Global Cap and allow for\nflexibility in adjusting Medicaid projections\nto\n\n83\n\nmeet unanticipated costs resulting from a\ndisaster. The Commissioner\u2019s powers are\nintended to limit the annual growth rate to\nthe levels set by the Global Cap for the then-\ncurrent fiscal year through actions that may\ninclude reducing reimbursement rates to\nproviders. These actions may be dependent upon\ntimely Federal approvals and other elements of\nthe program that govern implementation. Since\nthe enactment of the Global Cap, the portion\nof actual State Funds Medicaid spending\nsubject to the Global Cap has remained at or\nbelow indexed levels. However, in certain\nfiscal years, DOH has taken management\nactions, including adjustments to the timing\nof Medicaid payments consistent with\ncontractual terms, to ensure compliance with\nthe Global Cap. Similarly, in response to\ninitial delays in the Federal approval of\nplanned FY 2022 through FY 2024 State DPT, the\nState has advanced over $1.7 billion in State-\nonly payments to certain providers to help\nthem cover their immediate cash flow needs.\nThese State payments were expected to be\nremitted to the State by the providers upon\ntheir receipt of Federal DPT funds during FY\n2024. While all Federal approvals have been\ngranted with respect to those Federal DPT\nfunds, the provider reimbursements to the\nState are expected to be delayed beyond FY\n2024. This will result in upwards of $1.1\nbillion in additional DOH Medicaid spending\nincurred in FY 2024 that is expected to be\nreceived in FY 2025. State Labor Force - Labor\nNegotiations and Agreements The State\nnegotiates multi-year collective bargaining\nagreements with its unionized workforce that\nimpact personal service (PS) and fringe\nbenefit costs. The State\u2019s agreements with the\ntwo largest unions - the Civil Service\nEmployees Association (CSEA) and the Public\nEmployees Federation (PEF) - extend through FY\n2026. The agreements provide 3 percent across\nthe board salary increases for the remaining\nyears of the contract and a $3,000 bonus in FY\n2024. The State has commenced labor\nnegotiations with several unions for successor\ncontracts; however, there can be no assurance\nthat amounts informally reserved in the\nUpdated Financial Plan for labor settlements\nand agency operations will be sufficient to\nfund the cost of future labor contracts.\nSimilarly, SUNY reached an agreement with\nUnited University Professions (UUP) that runs\nfrom FY 2023 to FY 2026 and provides a 2\npercent across-the-board salary increase for\nFY 2023 and 3 percent across-the-board salary\nincreases from FY 2024 to FY 2026. The\nagreement with UUP will also provide a $1,500\nbonus to employees in FY 2025 and FY 2026. The\nJudiciary has contracts in place with all 12\nunions represented within its workforce, which\ninclude CSEA, the New York State Supreme Court\nOfficers Association, the New York State Court\nOfficers Association, the New York State Court\nClerks Association, and eight other unions.\nThese contracts cover a five-year period from\nFY 2022 through FY 2026 with terms consistent\nwith the CSEA agreement. Employee Benefits\nPension Contributions. The System provides\npension benefits to public employees of the\nState and its localities (except employees of\nNew York City, and public school teachers and\nadministrators, who are covered by separate\npublic retirement systems). State employees\nmade up about 31 percent of the System\u2019s\nmembership as of March 31, 2023. There were\n2,979 public employers participating in the\nSystem, including the State, all cities and\ncounties (except New York City), most towns,\nvillages and school districts (with respect to\nnon-teaching employees), and many public\nauthorities. As of March 31, 2023, 695,504\npersons were members of the System, and\n514,629 retirees and beneficiaries were\nreceiving pension benefits. Article 5, section\n7 of the State Constitution considers\nmembership in any State pension or retirement\nsystem to be \u201c a contractual relationship, the\nbenefits of which shall not be diminished or\nimpaired. \u201d The State and the Judiciary make\nannual contributions to the New York State and\nLocal Retirement System (NYSLRS) for employees\nin ERS and PFRS. This section discusses\ncontributions to the NYSLRS, which account for\nmost of the State\u2019s pension costs. 7 All\nprojections are based on estimated market\nreturns and numerous actuarial assumptions\nwhich, if unrealized, could have a materially\nadverse effect on these projections. 7 The\nState\u2019s aggregate pension costs also include\nState employees in the Teachers\u2019 Retirement\nSystem (TRS) for both the SUNY and SED, the\nOptional Retirement Program (ORP) for both\nSUNY and SED, and the New York State Voluntary\nDefined Contribution Plan (VDC). New York\nState Retirement and Social Security Law\n(RSSL) Section 11 directs the actuary for\nNYSLRS to provide regular reports on the\nSystem\u2019s experience and to propose assumptions\nand methods for the actuarial valuations.\nEmployer contribution rates for NYSLRS are\ndetermined based on investment performance in\nthe Common Retirement Fund and\n\n84\n\nactuarial assumptions recommended by the\nRetirement System\u2019s Actuary and approved by\nthe State Comptroller. Pension estimates are\nbased on the actuarial report issued in August\n2023. On August 31, 2023, the Comptroller\nannounced an increase in employer contribution\nrates for both ERS and PFRS which will impact\nexpenses in FY 2025. The average employer\ncontribution rate for ERS increased from 13.1\npercent to 15.2 percent of payroll, and the\naverage employer contribution rate for PFRS\nincreased from 27.8 percent to 31.2 percent of\npayroll. The increase in rates was primarily\nattributed to a -4.14 percent return in the\nCommon Retirement Fund, salary increases for\nactive members, and administrative expenses.\nIn addition, there was a discretionary 0.6\npercent increase in the ERS rate and 1.0\npercent increase in the PFRS rate due to\nunderstating certain liabilities in the\nprevious billing rates. As a result of the\nincreases in the employer contribution rates,\nparticipants in the Contribution Stabilization\nProgram will have the option to amortize a\nportion of their FY 2025 ERS and PFRS\nliability over a period of ten years. The\namounts eligible for amortization are to be\ndetermined by the System\u2019s Actuary and will be\nreflected in the employer\u2019s estimate. The\nUpdated Financial Plan does not currently\nassume the use of amortization. The Updated\nFinancial Plan reflects the prepayment of the\nFY 2025 ERS/PFRS pension estimate by the State\nin February 2024, rather than when it comes\ndue on March 1, 2025. The anticipated $1.7\nbillion prepayment would achieve approximately\n$110 million in interest savings. The\nComptroller does not forecast pension\nliability estimates on a multi-year basis,\nrequiring DOB to forecast cost for the three\noutyears. DOB\u2019s multi-year pension forecast\nassumes growth in the salary base consistent\nwith collective bargaining agreements and a\nlower rate of return compared to the current\nassumed rate of return by NYSLRS. Contribution\nStabilization Program. Under legislation\nenacted in August 2010, the State and local\ngovernments may amortize (defer paying) a\nportion of their annual pension costs that\nexceed a fixed increase. Amortization\ntemporarily reduces the pension costs that\nmust be paid by public employers in a given\nfiscal year but results in higher costs\noverall when repaid with interest. The full\namount of each amortization must be repaid\nwithin ten years at a fixed interest rate\ndetermined by OSC. The State and local\ngovernments are required to begin repayment on\nnew amortizations in the fiscal year\nimmediately following the year in which the\namortization was initiated. The State\ncurrently has no outstanding pension\namortization liability. The FY 2024 Enacted\nBudget included legislation to allow public\nemployers the option to terminate\nparticipation in the program provided they\nhave paid in full all prior year\namortizations. The State currently has no\nplans to withdraw from the program. Other\nPost-Employment Benefits (OPEB). State\nemployees become eligible for post-employment\nbenefits (e.g., health insurance) if they\nreach retirement while working for the State;\nare enrolled in either NYSHIP or the NYSHIP\nopt-out program at the time they reach\nretirement; and have the required years of\neligible service. The cost of providing post-\nretirement health insurance is shared between\nthe State and the retired employee.\nContributions are established by law and may\nbe amended by the Legislature. The State is\nnot required to provide funding above the Pay-\nAs-You- Go (PAYGO) amount necessary to provide\ncurrent benefits to retirees. The State\ncontinues to fund these costs, along with all\nother employee health care expenses, on a\nPAYGO basis, meaning the State pays these\ncosts as they become due. The State has\ndeposited $1.2 billion to the RHBTF which was\ncreated in FY 2018 as a qualified trust under\nGASBS 75 and is authorized to reserve money\nfor the payment of health benefits of retired\nemployees and their dependents. Under current\nlaw, the State may deposit into the RHBTF, in\nany given fiscal year, up to 1.5 percent of\nthe total then-current unfunded actuarial\naccrued OPEB liability ($62.5 billion on March\n31, 2023). There are no future deposits\nplanned at this time. State Debt Bond Market\nand Credit Ratings. Successful execution of\nthe Updated Financial Plan is dependent on the\nState\u2019s ability to market bonds. The State\nfinances much of its capital spending, in the\nfirst instance, from the General Fund or STIP,\nwhich it then reimburses with proceeds from\nthe sale of bonds. An inability of the State\nto sell bonds or notes at the level or on the\ntimetable it expects could have a material and\nadverse impact on the State\u2019s financial\nposition and the implementation of its Capital\nPlan. The success of projected public sales of\nmunicipal bonds is subject to prevailing\nmarket conditions and related ratings issued\nby national credit rating agencies, among\nother factors. Future developments in the\nfinancial markets, including possible changes\nin Federal tax law relating to the taxation of\ninterest on municipal bonds, may affect the\nmarket for outstanding State-supported and\nState-related debt.\n\n85\n\nAs of the date of the AIS Update, the major\nrating agencies - Fitch, Kroll, Moody\u2019s, and\nS&P - have assigned the State general credit\nratings of AA+, AA+, Aa1, and AA+,\nrespectively. The State\u2019s rating has a stable\noutlook from all four rating agencies. These\nratings reflect the State\u2019s economic recovery\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and commitment to\nstrong reserve levels. The most recent rating\naction was on April 13, 2022, when Moody\u2019s\nraised the State\u2019s credit rating from Aa2 to\nAa1, noting \u201c a significant increase in\nresources combined with agile fiscal\nmanagement that has resulted in balanced or\nnearly balanced budgets projected through the\nState\u2019s five-year financial plan. \u201d Debt\nReform Act Limit. The Debt Reform Act of 2000\n( \u201c Debt Reform Act \u201d ) restricts the issuance\nof State-supported debt funding to capital\npurposes only and limits the maximum term of\nbonds to 30 years. The Debt Reform Act limits\nthe amount of new State-supported debt to 4\npercent of State personal income, and new\nState-supported debt service costs to 5\npercent of All Funds receipts. The\nrestrictions apply to State-supported debt\nissued after April 1, 2000. DOB, as\nadministrator of the Debt Reform Act,\ndetermined that the State complied with the\nstatutory caps in the most recent calculation\nperiod (FY 2023). The State enacted\nlegislation that suspended certain provisions\nof the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022\nbond issuances as part of the State\u2019s response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, State-\nsupported debt issued in FY 2021 and FY 2022\nwas not limited to capital purposes and is not\ncounted towards the statutory caps on debt\noutstanding and debt service. Following this\ntemporary two-year suspension as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the provisions of the\nDebt Reform Act were reinstated for State-\nsupported debt issued in FY 2023 and beyond.\nOne limited exception to the Debt Reform Act\nremains for issuances undertaken by the State\nfor MTA capital projects which may be issued\nwith maximum maturities longer than 30 years.\nThis allows bonds to be issued over the full\nuseful life of the assets being financed,\nsubject to Federal tax law limitations, and is\nconsistent with the rules that would have been\nin effect if the projects had been directly\nfinanced by the MTA. Current projections\nanticipate that State-supported debt\noutstanding and State-supported debt service\nwill continue to remain below the limits\nimposed by the Debt Reform Act, in part\nreflecting the statutory suspension of the\ndebt caps during FY 2021 and FY 2022. Based on\nthe most recent personal income and debt\noutstanding forecasts, the available debt\ncapacity under the debt outstanding cap is\nexpected to decline from $23.5 billion in FY\n2024 to a low point of $352 million in FY\n2029. This calculation includes the estimated\nimpact of funding capital commitments with\nState bonds. The debt service on State-\nsupported debt subject to the statutory cap is\nprojected at $2.5 billion in FY 2024, or\nroughly $9.0 billion below the statutory debt\nservice limit. The State uses personal income\nestimates published by the Federal government,\nspecifically the Bureau of Economic Analysis\n(BEA), to calculate the cap on debt\noutstanding, as required by statute. The BEA\nrevises these estimates on a quarterly basis\nand such revisions can be significant. For\nFederal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns\nincome from the state where it was earned to\nthe state in which a person resides, for\nsituations where a person lives and earns\nincome in different states (the \u201c residency\nadjustment \u201d ). The BEA residency adjustment\nhas the effect of reducing reported New York\nState personal income because income earned in\nNew York by non-residents regularly exceeds\nincome earned in other states by New York\nresidents. The State taxes all personal income\nearned in New York, regardless of place of\nresidency. Executive Budget - Debt Cap\nChanges. In the FY 2025 Executive Budget, the\nState proposes new bond-financed capital\ncommitments that would add $3 billion in new\ndebt over the five-year Capital Plan period.\nThe new capital commitments and FY 2025\nExecutive Budget personal income forecast\ndecrease debt capacity, which is offset by the\nassumptions that the State will issue bonds on\na slower schedule and there will be more\nunderspending on capital projects. Debt\ncapacity also reflects the suspension of the\nDebt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022\nissuances in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, as discussed previously. The State\nmay adjust capital spending priorities and\ndebt financing practices from time to time to\npreserve available debt capacity and stay\nwithin the statutory limits, as events\nwarrant. Localities and Authorities Financial\nCondition of New York State Localities. The\nState\u2019s localities rely in part on State aid\nto balance their budgets and meet their\ncommitments and expenses. The largest driver\nof costs for most counties is Medicaid;\nhowever, the State has taken over all the\ngrowth in the program since FY 2007 and funds\nthe entire cost of minimum wage and homecare\nwage\n\n86\n\nincreases. Unanticipated financial needs among\nlocalities can adversely affect the State\u2019s\nUpdated Financial Plan projections. Localities\noutside the City of New York, including cities\nand counties, have experienced financial\nproblems, and have been allocated additional\nState assistance during the last several State\nfiscal years. The Financial Restructuring\nBoard for Local Governments (the \u201c\nRestructuring Board \u201d ) aids distressed local\ngovernments by performing comprehensive\nreviews and providing grants and loans on the\ncondition of implementing recommended\nefficiency initiatives. MTA. The MTA operates\npublic transportation in the City of New York\nmetropolitan area, including subways, buses,\ncommuter rail, and tolled vehicle crossings.\nThe services provided by the MTA and its\noperating agencies are integral to the economy\nof the City of New York and the surrounding\nmetropolitan region, as well as to the economy\nof the State. MTA operations are funded mainly\nfrom fare and toll revenue, dedicated taxes,\nand subsidies from the State and the City of\nNew York. MTA Capital Plans also rely on\nsignificant direct contributions from the\nState and the City of New York. The State is\ndirectly contributing $9.1 billion to the\nMTA\u2019s 2015-19 Capital Plan and $3.1 billion to\nthe MTA\u2019s 2020-24 Capital Plan. These State\ncommitment levels represent substantial\nincreases from the funding levels for prior\nMTA Capital Plans (2010-2014: $770 million;\n2005-2009: $1.45 billion). In addition, a\nsubstantial amount of new funding to the MTA\nwas authorized in the FY 2020 Enacted Budget\nas part of a comprehensive reform plan\nexpected to generate an estimated $25 billion\nin financing for the MTA\u2019s 2020-2024 Capital\nPlan. The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe\ndeclines in MTA ridership and traffic in 2020,\nand ridership remains significantly below pre-\npandemic levels. To offset operating losses to\nMTA\u2019s Financial Plan from the estimated fare,\ntoll, and dedicated revenue loss attributable\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal\ngovernment provided over $15 billion in\noperating aid through various acts. In\naddition, the MTA also borrowed $2.9 billion\nthrough the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s (Federal\nReserve) Municipal Liquidity Facility. In the\nFY 2024 Enacted Budget, the State took\nsubstantial action to provide the MTA with\nadditional operating revenues dedicated to\nhelp solve the MTA\u2019s fiscal crisis. This\nincluded an increase in the metropolitan\ncommuter transportation mobility tax (MCTMT)\nin the City of New York, a one-time State\nsubsidy of $300 million, an increase in the\nCity of New York\u2019s contribution to the MTA for\nthe costs of paratransit services and\ndirecting a portion of future casino revenues\nto the MTA. Risks to the MTA\u2019s current\nfinancial projections include, but are not\nlimited to, the level and pace at which\nridership will return, the economic conditions\nof the MTA region, the ability to implement\ncost controls and savings actions, and the\nability to implement biennial fare and toll\nincreases. If additional resources are\nprovided by the State in future years, either\nthrough additional subsidies or new revenues,\nit could have a material and adverse impact on\nthe State\u2019s Financial Plan. Other Risks and\nOngoing Concerns Climate Change. Climate\nchange poses significant threats to physical,\nbiological, and economic systems in New York\nand around the world. Hazards and risks\nrelated to climate change for the State\ninclude, among other things, rising sea\nlevels, increased coastal flooding and related\nerosion hazards, intensifying storms and\nwildfires, and more extreme heat. The\nimmediate and long-term effects of climate\nchange could adversely impact the Updated\nFinancial Plan in the current year or in\nfuture years. To mitigate and manage these\nimpacts, the Federal government, the State,\nmunicipalities, and public utilities continue\nto undertake a variety of actions to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions and adapt existing\ninfrastructure to the changing environment.\nHowever, given the size and scope of potential\ndisruptions, there can be no assurance that\nsuch efforts will be adequate or timely enough\nto mitigate the most damaging effects of\nclimate change. Storms affecting the State,\nincluding Hurricane Ida (September 2021),\nSuperstorm Sandy (October 2012), Tropical\nStorm Lee (September 2011), and Hurricane\nIrene (August 2011), and more recently the\nsevere flooding that swept through the Hudson\nValley during the summer of 2023, have\ndemonstrated vulnerabilities in the State\u2019s\ninfrastructure (including mass transit\nsystems, power transmission and distribution\nsystems, and other critical lifelines) to\nextreme weather-driven events, including\ncoastal flooding caused by storm surges and\nflash floods from rainfall. Rating agencies\nare incorporating Environmental, Social, and\nGovernance (ESG) factors into their credit\nanalysis for the State and other issuers.\nRising sea levels and their effect on coastal\ninfrastructure have been identified as the\nprimary climate risks for the northeastern\nUnited States, including New York State. These\nrisks are heightened by population and\ncritical infrastructure concentration in\ncoastal areas. The release of issuer ESG\nscores by the rating agencies does not cause a\nchange in the State\u2019s overall credit ratings,\nwhich are based on financial information in\naddition to the ESG component. Climate\n\n87\n\nchange risks increasingly fall within the\nmaximum maturity term of current outstanding\nbonds of the State, its public authorities,\nand municipalities. State bonds may generally\nbe issued with a term of up to 30 years under\nState statute. The State is participating in\nefforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to\nmitigate the risk of severe impacts from\nclimate change. In 2019, the Climate\nLeadership and Community Protection Act\n(CLCPA) was signed into law. The CLCPA set the\nState on a path toward reducing statewide\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below\nthe 1990 level by 2030, and 85 percent below\nthe 1990 level by 2050. Additionally, in\naccordance with the CLCPA, the State plans to\nrequire a minimum of 70 percent of electricity\nto be generated from renewable sources by 2030\nand plans to fully transition its electricity\nsector to zero emissions by 2040. Several\nfactors may impact the ability to achieve\nthese goals and directives, and, therefore, no\nassurances can be made that such objectives\nwill be met. The CLCPA created the Climate\nAction Council (CAC), which was tasked with\ndeveloping a Scoping Plan with recommendations\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase\nrenewable energy usage, and promote climate\njustice. The CAC approved and adopted the\nfinal Scoping Plan on December 19, 2022, which\nrecommended, among many other actions, that\nthe State develop an economywide cap-and-\ninvest program to limit greenhouse gas\nemissions. The State is currently advancing an\neconomywide cap-and-invest program that\nestablishes a declining cap on greenhouse gas\nemissions, while seeking to limit potential\ncosts to economically vulnerable New Yorkers,\ninvest proceeds in programs that drive\nemissions reductions in an equitable manner,\nand maintain the competitiveness of New York\nbusinesses and industries. Pursuant to the\nCLCPA, the Department of Environmental\nConservation (DEC) is required to promulgate\nrules and regulations to help ensure the State\nmeets the CLCPA\u2019s statewide greenhouse gas\nemission limits. New York\u2019s electricity system\nis already part of a regional cap-and-invest\nprogram, the Regional Greenhouse Gas\nInitiative (RGGI). Since RGGI began operation\nin 2008, the program has helped reduce\ngreenhouse gases from power plants by more\nthan half and raised over $7.1 billion to\nsupport cleaner energy solutions amongst its\n11 participating states. Concurrently, the\nState has been taking regulatory and\nlegislative actions that are intended to limit\ngreenhouse gas emissions, electrify\ntransportation, and generate more electricity\nfrom renewable sources. Realization of these\nactions and their intended outcomes is\ncontingent upon successful implementation,\nand, therefore, no assurances can be made that\nsuch actions will be realized as planned.\nMajor regulatory and legislative actions\ninclude: \u2022 Authorizing the New York Power\nAuthority to plan, design, develop, finance,\nconstruct, own, operate, maintain and improve\nrenewable energy generating projects; \u2022\nProhibiting building systems and/or equipment\nthat burn fossil fuels in new construction\nstarting December 31, 2025 for any new\nbuilding seven stories or lower, except large\ncommercial and industrial buildings, and\nDecember 31, 2028 for other new buildings; \u2022\nRequiring new off-road vehicles and equipment\nsold in New York to be zero-emissions by 2035\nand new medium- duty and heavy-duty vehicles\nto be zero-emissions by 2045; \u2022 Mandating that\nby no later than July 1, 2027, school\ndistricts and private transportation\ncontractors purchase or lease only zero-\nemission school buses when purchasing or\nleasing new school buses, with full fleet\nconversion and operation of zero-emission\nschool buses required by July 1, 2035; \u2022\nAppropriating $200 million in FY 2024 to help\nlow-income families retrofit their homes by\nadding insulation, installing energy efficient\nappliances, and switching to clean energy; and\n\u2022 Appropriating $500 million in FY 2024 to\nadvance the offshore wind industry. During the\nNovember 2022 general election, New York State\nvoters approved the Clean Water, Clean Air,\nand Green Jobs Bond Act. The $4.2 billion bond\nact will support capital improvements and\nenhancements in the following areas: flood\nrisk reduction/restorations; open space,\nworking lands conservation, and recreation;\nclimate change mitigation; and water quality\nimprovement and resilient infrastructure.\nCybersecurity. New York State government, like\nmany other large public and private entities,\nrelies on a large and complex technology\nenvironment to conduct its operations. As a\nrecipient and provider of personal, private,\nor sensitive information, the State and its\nauthorities, agencies and public benefit\ncorporations, as well as its political\nsubdivisions (including counties, cities,\ntowns, villages and school districts) face\nmultiple cyber threats involving, but not\nlimited to, hacking, viruses, ransomware,\nmalware and other attacks on computers and\nother networks and systems. Entities or\nindividuals may attempt to gain unauthorized\naccess to the State\u2019s technology environment\nfor the purposes of misappropriating assets or\n\n88\n\ninformation or causing operational disruption\nand damage. In addition, the tactics used in\nmalicious attacks to obtain unauthorized\naccess to networks and systems change\nfrequently and are often not recognized until\nlaunched against a target. Accordingly, the\nState may be unable to fully anticipate these\ntechniques or implement adequate preventative\nmeasures. To mitigate the risk of business\noperations impact and/or damage from cyber\nincidents or cyber-attacks, the State invests\nin multiple forms of cybersecurity and\noperational controls. The State\u2019s Chief\nInformation Security Office (CISO) within the\nState\u2019s Office of Information Technology\nServices (ITS) maintains policies, standards,\nprograms, and services relating to the\nsecurity of State government networks. The\nCISO is responsible for annually assessing the\nmaturity of certain State agencies\u2019\ncybersecurity postures through the Nationwide\nCybersecurity Review. In addition, the CISO\nmaintains the New York State Cyber Command\nCenter team, which possesses digital forensics\ncapabilities, and manages cyber incident\nreporting and response. The CISO also\ndistributes real-time advisories and alerts,\nprovides managed security services, and\nimplements Statewide information security\nawareness training. The State has also\ndeveloped partnerships with local governments\nto better address cybersecurity threats. In\nFebruary 2022, the Governor announced the\ncreation of an information-sharing\npartnership, the Joint Security Operations\nCenter (JSOC). The JSOC is a partnership\nbetween the State and the cities of Albany,\nBuffalo, the City of New York, Rochester,\nSyracuse, and Yonkers. The JSOC combines\nlocal, State, and Federal cyber threat\ninformation in order to increase collaboration\non threat intelligence, reduce response times,\nand yield faster and more effective\nremediation in the event of a major cyber\nincident. The FY 2024 Enacted Budget provided\nfunding to expand New York\u2019s Shared Services\nProgram to help county and local governments\nand other regional partners acquire and deploy\nhigh quality cybersecurity services to bolster\ntheir cyber defenses. Occasionally, intrusions\ninto State digital systems have been detected,\nbut they have generally been contained. While\ncybersecurity procedures and controls are\nroutinely reviewed and tested, there can be no\nassurance that such security and operational\ncontrol measures will be completely successful\nat preventing future cyber threats and\nattacks. Successful attacks could adversely\nimpact the State, including disrupting\nbusiness operations, harming State networks\nand systems, or damaging State and local\ninfrastructure; and the costs of remediation\nand recovery could be substantial. The State\nhas also adopted regulations designed to\nprotect the financial services industry from\ncyberattacks. Banks, insurance companies and\nother covered entities regulated by DFS are,\nunless eligible for limited exemptions,\nrequired to: (a) maintain a cybersecurity\nprogram, (b) create written cybersecurity\npolicies and perform risk assessments, (c)\ndesignate someone with responsibility to\noversee the cybersecurity program, (d)\nannually certify compliance with the\ncybersecurity regulations, and (e) report to\nDFS cybersecurity events that have a\nreasonable likelihood of materially harming\nany substantial part of the entity\u2019s normal\noperation(s) or for which notice is required\nto any government body, self-regulatory\nagency, or supervisory body. SUNY Downstate\nHospital and the Long Island College Hospital\n(LICH). In May 2011, the real property and\nother assets of LICH were transferred to a New\nYork State not-for-profit corporation ( \u201c\nHoldings \u201d ), the sole member of which is\nSUNY. Pursuant to a court-approved settlement\nin 2014, SUNY agreed to sell the assets\nacquired from LICH to the Fortis Property\ngroup and NYU Langone. The initial closing of\nthe purchase agreement with Fortis was held in\nSeptember 2015, and a second closing with NYU\nLangone occurred in March 2020. The final\nclosing at which two remaining portions of the\nLICH properties would have been conveyed to\nFortis did not occur as scheduled, and in 2023\nHoldings terminated the purchase and sale\nagreement. Holdings has commenced litigation\nagainst Fortis to recover certain\ncontractually required payments, and that\nlitigation is ongoing. However, DOB has\ndetermined that the LICH transaction has been\nsufficiently resolved that it no longer poses\na material risk to the Financial Plan and will\ndiscontinue reporting on this transaction at\nthe end of the current fiscal year.\nSupranational Entities Risk. Certain of the\nFunds may invest in obligations issued or\nguaranteed by supranational entities ( e.g. ,\nthe World Bank, European Investment Bank,\nInter-American Development Bank, and Asia\nDevelopment Bank), which are often chartered\nto promote economic development. The\ngovernment members, or \u201c stockholders, \u201d\nusually make initial capital contributions to\nthe supranational entity and, in many cases,\nare committed to make additional capital\ncontributions if such entity is unable to\nrepay its borrowings. There is no guarantee\nthat one or more stockholders of the\nsupranational entity will continue to make any\nnecessary additional capital contributions. If\nsuch contributions are not made, the entity\nmay be unable to pay interest or repay\nprincipal on its debt securities, certain of\nthe Funds may have limited legal recourse in\nthe event of default, and certain of the Funds\nmay lose money on such investments.\n\n89\n\nTax Risks Associated with Municipal\nSecurities. As with any investment, you should\nconsider how your investment in shares of each\nMunicipal Bond Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in the relevant Prospectus and\nthis SAI is provided as general information.\nYou should consult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an investment in\nshares of each Municipal Bond Fund. Unless\nyour investment in shares is made through a\ntax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement\naccount, such as an individual retirement\naccount, you need to be aware of the possible\ntax consequences when each Municipal Bond Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Municipal Bond\nFund shares. In general, each Municipal Bond\nFund seeks to produce income that is generally\nexempt from federal income tax and will not\nbenefit investors in tax deferred retirement\naccounts such as IRAs or investors not subject\nto federal income tax. Further, the iShares\nCalifornia Muni Bond ETF generally invests in\nsecurities that produce income that is\ngenerally exempt from California's income tax,\nwhich will not provide any state tax benefit\nto investors who are not subject to\nCalifornia's state income tax and the iShares\nNew York Muni Bond ETF generally invests in\nsecurities that produce income that is\ngenerally exempt from New York's income tax,\nwhich will not provide any state tax benefit\nto investors who are not subject to New York's\nstate income tax. In response to the national\neconomic downturn in recent years,\ngovernmental cost burdens may be reallocated\namong federal, state and local governments.\nAlso, as a result of the downturn, many state\nand local governments are experiencing\nsignificant reductions in revenues and are\nconsequently experiencing difficulties meeting\nongoing expenses. Certain of these state or\nlocal governments may have difficulty paying\nprincipal or interest on their outstanding\ndebt and may experience ratings downgrades of\ntheir debt. U.S. Economic Trading Partners\nRisk. The U.S. is a significant, and in some\ncases the most significant, trading partner\nof, or foreign investor in, certain countries\nin which a Fund invests. As a result, economic\nconditions of such countries may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on a\ncountry\u2019s economic conditions and, as a\nresult, securities to which a Fund has\nexposure. Circumstances could arise that could\nprevent the timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government debt, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in substantial\nnegative consequences for the U.S. economy and\nthe global financial system. There are\nstrained relations between the U.S. and a\nnumber of foreign countries. If these\nrelations were to worsen, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S.\nissuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The\nU.S. has also experienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If this trend were to\ncontinue, it may have an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and many of the issuers in which\na Fund invests. U.S. Treasury Obligations\nRisk. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ\nfrom other securities in their interest rates,\nmaturities, times of issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers,\nchanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of the U.S. government may cause the\nvalue of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated\nAA+ by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the\nrating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause\nthe value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Because U.S.\ngovernment debt obligations are often used as\na benchmark for other borrowing arrangements,\na downgrade could also result in higher\ninterest rates for a range of borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse effect on the\nU.S. and global economy. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market pressures to meet\ngovernment funding needs, which may drive debt\ncost higher and lead the government to issue\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that the U.S. government will\nnot be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. If market\nparticipants determine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become unsustainable, the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary pressures,\nparticularly with respect to services\noutsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods and constrain or prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S., circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in losses to a\nFund and substantial negative consequences for\nthe U.S. economy and the global financial\nsystem.\n\n90\n\nValuation Risk. In certain circumstances, a\nFund\u2019s securities may be valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations. The\nvalue established for a security may be\ndifferent from what would be produced through\nthe use of another methodology or if the value\nhad been priced using market quotations.\nSecurities that are valued using methods other\nthan market quotations, including \u201c fair\nvalued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their value from one day to the\nnext than would be the case if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no\nassurance that a Fund could sell a security\nfor the value established for it at any time,\nand it is possible that a Fund could incur a\nloss if a security is sold for less than its\nestablished value. Risk of Investing in\nAfrica. Investments in securities of issuers\nin certain African countries involve\nheightened risks including, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, civil war, and social\ninstability as a result of religious, ethnic\nand/or socio-economic unrest or widespread\noutbreaks of disease and, in certain\ncountries, genocidal warfare. Certain\ncountries in Africa generally have less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries, and, consequently,\nthe risks of investing in foreign securities\nare magnified in such countries. Because\nsecurities markets of countries in Africa are\ngenerally underdeveloped and are generally\nless correlated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether. Market volatility may\nalso be heightened by the actions of a small\nnumber of investors. Brokerage firms in\ncertain countries in Africa may be fewer in\nnumber and less established than brokerage\nfirms in more developed markets. Since a Fund\nmay need to effect securities transactions\nthrough these brokerage firms, the Fund is\nsubject to the risk that these brokerage firms\nwill not be able to fulfill their obligations\nto the Fund ( i.e., counterparty risk). This\nrisk is magnified to the extent that a Fund\neffects securities transactions through a\nsingle brokerage firm or a small number of\nbrokerage firms. Certain governments in\nAfrican countries restrict or control to\nvarying degrees the ability of foreign\ninvestors to invest in securities of issuers\nlocated or operating in those countries.\nMoreover, certain countries in Africa require\ngovernmental approval or special licenses\nprior to investment by foreign investors and\nmay limit the amount of investment by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer, and may limit such foreign investment\nto a certain class of securities of an issuer\nthat may have less advantageous rights than\nthe classes available for purchase by domestic\ninvestors of the countries and/or impose\nadditional taxes on foreign investors. A delay\nin obtaining a government approval or a\nlicense would delay investments in a\nparticular country, and, as a result, a Fund\nmay not be able to invest in certain\nsecurities while approval is pending. The\ngovernment of a particular country may also\nwithdraw or decline to renew a license that\nenables a Fund to invest in such country.\nThese factors make investing in issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nsignificantly riskier than investing in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\ncountries, and any one of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa are generally not subject\nto the same rules and regulations as issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. Therefore, there may be less\nfinancial and other information publicly\navailable with regard to issuers located or\noperating in countries in Africa and such\nissuers are generally not subject to the\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which a Fund may invest\nmay levy withholding or other taxes on income\nsuch as dividends, interest and realized\ncapital gains. Although in certain countries\nin Africa a portion of these taxes are\nrecoverable, the non-recovered portion of\nforeign withholding taxes will reduce the\nincome received from investments in such\ncountries. Investment in countries in Africa\nmay be subject to a greater degree of risk\nassociated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, a\nFund could be adversely affected by delays in,\nor a refusal to grant, required governmental\napproval for repatriation of capital, as well\nas by the application to the Fund of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\na Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local\ngovernment approvals or take other actions,\neach of which may involve additional costs to\na Fund.\n\n91\n\nSecurities laws in many countries in Africa\nare relatively new and unsettled and,\nconsequently, there is a risk of rapid and\nunpredictable change in laws regarding foreign\ninvestment, securities regulation, title to\nsecurities and shareholder rights.\nAccordingly, foreign investors may be\nadversely affected by new or amended laws and\nregulations. In addition, there may be no\nsingle centralized securities exchange on\nwhich securities are traded in certain\ncountries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which a Fund invests\nmay operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Africa may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nAfrica. Some countries in Africa may be\naffected by a greater degree of public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Political instability and protests in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East have caused\nand may in the future cause significant\ndisruptions to many industries. In addition,\nthe outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa\nseverely challenged health care industries in\nthose countries and adversely impacted the\nregion\u2019s economy due to quarantines and\ndisruptions of trade, which has further\nincreased instability in the region. This\ninstability has demonstrated that political\nand social unrest can spread quickly through\nthe region, and that developments in one\ncountry can influence the political events in\nneighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in a Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities\n\n92\n\nwith certain of its neighboring countries.\nIncreased political and social unrest in these\ngeographic areas could adversely affect the\nperformance of investments in this region.\nCertain governments in this region administer\nprices on several basic goods, including fuel\nand electricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by a relevant Fund. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\ndependent on trading with certain key trading\npartners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in Central and South America. The\neconomies of certain Central and South\nAmerican countries have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility,\ninflation, currency devaluations, government\ndefaults, high unemployment rates and\npolitical instability which can adversely\naffect issuers in these countries. In\naddition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof the region's exports and many economies in\nthis region are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on other countries\nof this region. The governments of certain\ncountries in Central and South America may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on the securities\nin which the Fund invests. Diplomatic\ndevelopments may also adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Central\nand South America. Some countries in Central\nand South America may be affected by public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which the Fund invests may be the\nsubject of sanctions (for example, the U.S.\nhas imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan\nindividuals, corporate entities and the\nVenezuelan government) or have dealings with\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. The\nFund may be adversely affected if it invests\nin such issuers.\n\n93\n\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Certain of the Funds may\ninvest in securities of issuers domiciled in\nemerging market countries. Investments in\nemerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Funds\nare not actively managed and do not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of\n\n94\n\nemerging market country securities may also\naffect a Fund's ability to accurately value\nits portfolio securities or to acquire or\ndispose of securities at the price and time it\nwishes to do so or in order to meet redemption\nrequests. Many emerging market countries\nsuffer from uncertainty and corruption in\ntheir legal frameworks. Legislation may be\ndifficult to interpret and laws may be too new\nto provide any precedential value. Laws\nregarding foreign investment and private\nproperty may be weak or non-existent. Sudden\nchanges in governments may result in policies\nwhich are less favorable to investors such as\npolicies designed to expropriate or\nnationalize \u201c sovereign \u201d assets. Certain\nemerging market countries in the past have\nexpropriated large amounts of private\nproperty, in many cases with little or no\ncompensation, and there can be no assurance\nthat such expropriation will not occur in the\nfuture. Investment in the securities markets\nof certain emerging market countries is\nrestricted or controlled to varying degrees.\nThese restrictions may limit a Fund's\ninvestment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nFund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. A Fund's income\nand, in some cases, capital gains from foreign\nsecurities will be subject to applicable\ntaxation in certain of the emerging market\ncountries in which it invests, and treaties\nbetween the U.S. and such countries may not be\navailable in some cases to reduce the\notherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes a Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries. A\nFund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the EU. A number of countries\nwithin the EU are also members of the EMU (the\n\u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the euro as\ntheir currency. Eurozone membership requires\nmember states to comply with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates,\ndebt levels and fiscal and monetary controls,\neach of which may significantly affect every\ncountry in Europe. Changes in import or export\ntariffs, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro and other currencies of\ncertain EU countries which are not in the\neurozone, the default or threat of default by\nan EU member state on its sovereign debt,\nand/or an economic recession in an EU member\nstate may have a significant adverse effect on\nthe economies of other EU member states and\ntheir trading partners. Although certain\nEuropean countries are not in the eurozone,\nmany of these countries are obliged to meet\nthe criteria for joining the eurozone.\n\n95\n\nConsequently, these countries must comply with\nmany of the restrictions noted above. The\nEuropean financial markets have experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns, government debt\nlevels and the possible default of government\ndebt in several European countries, including,\nbut not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,\nFrance, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,\nSpain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further\neconomic deterioration, certain countries,\nwithout prior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Risk of Investing in the Middle\nEast. Many Middle Eastern countries have\nlittle or no democratic tradition, and the\npolitical and legal systems in such countries\nmay have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many\neconomies in the Middle East are highly\nreliant on income from the sale of oil and\nnatural gas or trade with countries involved\nin the sale of oil and natural gas, and their\neconomies are therefore vulnerable to changes\nin the market for oil and natural gas and\nforeign currency values. As global demand for\noil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle\nEastern economies may be significantly\nimpacted. In addition, many Middle Eastern\ngovernments have exercised and continue to\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. In certain\ncases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s government\nmay own or control many companies, including\nsome of the largest companies in the country.\nAccordingly, governmental actions in the\nfuture could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and a Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in a Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as\n\n96\n\na high concentration of investors and\nfinancial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle\nEastern countries typically are fewer in\nnumber and less capitalized than brokers in\nthe U.S. The legal systems in certain Middle\nEastern countries also may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund. For example, the potential\nliability of a shareholder in a U.S.\ncorporation with respect to acts of the\ncorporation generally is limited to the amount\nof the shareholder\u2019s investment. However, the\nnotion of limited liability is less clear in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund\ntherefore may be liable in certain Middle\nEastern countries for the acts of a\ncorporation in which it invests for an amount\ngreater than its actual investment in that\ncorporation. Similarly, the rights of\ninvestors in Middle Eastern issuers may be\nmore limited than those of shareholders of a\nU.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as a\nFund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of a Fund. For example, in certain\nof these countries, a Fund may be required to\ninvest initially through a local broker or\nother entity and then have the shares that\nwere purchased re-registered in the name of a\nFund. Re-registration in some instances may\nnot be possible on a timely basis. This may\nresult in a delay during which a Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where a Fund places a\npurchase order but is subsequently informed,\nat the time of re-registration, that the\npermissible allocation of the investment to\nforeign investors has already been filled and,\nconsequently, a Fund may not be able to invest\nin the relevant company. Substantial\nlimitations may exist in certain Middle\nEastern countries with respect to a Fund\u2019s\nability to repatriate investment income or\ncapital gains. A Fund could be adversely\naffected by delays in, or a refusal to grant,\nany required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to a Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which a Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which a Fund invests.\nThe U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest\ntrading and investment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are significantly\naffected by developments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total\nmerchandise trade among the three countries\nhas increased. However, political developments\nincluding the implementation of tariffs by the\nU.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the\nform of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could\n\n97\n\nnegatively affect North America\u2019s economic\noutlook and, as a result, the value of\nsecurities held by a Fund. Policy and\nlegislative changes in one country may have a\nsignificant effect on North American markets\ngenerally, as well as on the value of certain\nsecurities held by a Fund. Risk of Investing\nin Russia. Investing in the Russian securities\nmarket involves a high degree of risk and\nspecial considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities market, and should be considered\nhighly speculative. Risks include: the absence\nof developed legal structures governing\nprivate and foreign investments and private\nproperty; the possibility of the loss of all\nor a substantial portion of a Fund\u2019s assets\ninvested in Russia as a result of\nexpropriation; certain national policies which\nmay restrict the Fund\u2019s investment\nopportunities, including, without limitation,\nrestrictions on investing in issuers or\nindustries deemed sensitive to relevant\nnational interests; and potentially greater\nprice volatility in, significantly smaller\ncapitalization of, and relative illiquidity\nof, the Russian market. There can also be no\nassurance that a Fund\u2019s investments in the\nRussian securities market would not be\nexpropriated, nationalized or otherwise\nconfiscated. In the event of the settlement of\nany such claims or such expropriation,\nnationalization or other confiscation, a Fund\ncould lose its entire investment. In addition,\nit may be difficult and more costly to obtain\nand enforce a judgment in the Russian court\nsystem. Russia may also be subject to a\ngreater degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability than is the case in other\ndeveloped countries. Such instability may\nresult from, among other things, the\nfollowing: (i) an authoritarian government or\nmilitary involvement in political and economic\ndecision-making, including changes in\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means;\n(ii) popular unrest associated with demands\nfor improved political, economic and social\nconditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv)\nhostile relations, including armed conflict,\nwith neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic,\nreligious and racial disaffection. The Russian\neconomy is heavily dependent upon the export\nof a range of commodities including most\nindustrial metals, forestry products and oil\nand gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected\nby international commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. As Russia produces and\nexports large amounts of crude oil and gas,\nany acts of terrorism or armed conflict\ncausing disruptions of Russian oil and gas\nexports could negatively affect the Russian\neconomy and, thus, adversely affect the\nfinancial condition, results of operations or\nprospects of related companies. Current and\nfuture economic sanctions may also adversely\naffect the Russian oil, banking, mining,\nmetals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among\nother sectors. The Russian government may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in Russia, which could\nhave a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in Russia. In recent years,\nthe Russian government has begun to take\nbolder steps to re-assert its regional\ngeopolitical influence (including military\nsteps) and launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. Additionally,\nRussia is alleged to have participated in\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Such steps\nhave increased tensions between Russia and its\nneighbors and Western countries and may\nnegatively affect economic growth. Actual and\nthreatened responses by other nation-states to\nRussia\u2019s alleged cyber activity may have an\nadverse impact on the Russian economy and the\nRussian issuers of securities in which a Fund\ninvests. For example, the U.S. has added\ncertain foreign technology companies to the\nU.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Russian economy.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich a Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally.\n\n98\n\nRussia Sanctions . Governments in the U.S. and\nmany other countries (collectively, the \u201c\nSanctioning Bodies \u201d ) have imposed economic\nsanctions on certain Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, and Russian corporate\nand banking entities, including banning Russia\nfrom global payments systems that facilitate\ncross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies,\nor others, could also institute broader\nsanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even\nthe threat of further sanctions, may result in\nthe decline of the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities, a weakening of the ruble\nor other adverse consequences to the Russian\neconomy. These sanctions could also result in\nthe immediate freeze of Russian securities\nand/or funds invested in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell,\nreceive or deliver those securities and/or\nassets. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. The sanctions\nagainst certain Russian issuers include\nprohibitions on transacting in or dealing in\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers.\nCompliance with each of these sanctions has\nand may continue to impair the ability of a\nFund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver\nthe affected securities or other securities of\nsuch issuers. If it becomes impracticable or\nunlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject\nto, or otherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may\nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected\nsecurities in connection with creation\ntransactions and instead require a cash\ndeposit, which may also increase a Fund\u2019s\ntransaction costs. A Fund may also be legally\nrequired to freeze assets in a blocked\naccount. Sanctions have resulted in Russia\ntaking counter measures or retaliatory\nactions, which has impaired the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nretaliatory measures include the immediate\nfreeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due\nto such a freeze of these assets, including\ndepositary receipts, a Fund may need to\nliquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in a Fund receiving\nsubstantially lower prices for its securities.\nRussia may implement additional retaliatory\nmeasures, which may further impair the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities and the\nability of the Fund to receive dividend\npayments. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russian companies\nmay be unable to pay dividends and, if they\npay dividends, the Fund may be unable to\nreceive them. These sanctions, the decision by\nRussia to suspend trading on the Moscow\nExchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident\ninvestors from executing security sales, and\nother events have led to changes in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\u2019s Index Provider\nhas removed Russian securities from the\nUnderlying Index. To the extent that the Fund\nrebalances its portfolio and trades in non-\nRussian securities to seek to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index,\nthis may result in transaction costs and\nincreased tracking error. The Fund is\ncurrently restricted from trading in Russian\nsecurities, including those in its portfolio,\nwhile the Underlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. This disparity will also lead to\nincreased tracking error. The inability of the\nFund to trade in Russian securities may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to meet\nits investment objective. It is unknown when,\nor if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u2019s\nability to trade in Russian securities will\nresume. Also, if an affected security is\nincluded in a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index, a Fund\nmay, where practicable, seek to eliminate its\nholdings of the affected security by employing\nor augmenting its representative sampling\nstrategy to seek to track the investment\nresults of its Underlying Index. The use of\n(or increased use of) a representative\nsampling strategy may increase a Fund\u2019s\ntracking error risk. If the affected\nsecurities constitute a significant percentage\nof the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be\nable to effectively implement a representative\nsampling strategy, which may result in\nsignificant tracking error between a Fund\u2019s\nperformance and the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. Risk of Investing in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors (such\nas the Funds) to invest in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such\nability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors, including a\nlimitation on a Fund\u2019s ownership of the\nsecurities of any single issuer listed on the\nSaudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent a Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted at any time. A Fund may not\nbe able to obtain or maintain any such\nlicenses or approvals and may not be able to\nbuy and sell securities at full value. Major\ndisruptions or regulatory changes\n\n99\n\ncould occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any\nof which could negatively impact a Fund. These\nrisks may be exacerbated, compared to more\ndeveloped markets, given the limited history\nof foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also\nbe subject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand a Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental actions\nin the future could have a significant effect\non economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which\ncould affect private sector companies and a\nFund, as well as the value of securities in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on\nSaudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian\ncorporate entities, or even the threat of\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Saudi Arabian\nsecurities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or\nother adverse consequences to the Saudi\nArabian economy. Any sanctions could also\nresult in the immediate freeze of Saudi\nArabian securities and/or funds investing in\nprohibited assets, impairing the ability of a\nFund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those\nsecurities and/or assets. In addition, Saudi\nArabia\u2019s economy relies heavily on cheap,\nforeign labor, and changes in the availability\nof this labor supply could have an adverse\neffect on the economy. The securities markets\nin Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as\nthose in other countries. As a result,\nsecurities markets in Saudi Arabia are subject\nto greater risks associated with market\nvolatility, lower market capitalization, lower\ntrading volume, illiquidity, inflation,\ngreater price fluctuations, uncertainty\nregarding the existence of trading markets,\ngovernmental control and heavy regulation of\nlabor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi\nArabian companies tend to trade less\nfrequently than those of companies on\nexchanges in more developed markets. Such\ninfrequent trading may adversely affect the\npricing of these securities and a Fund\u2019s\nability to sell these securities in the\nfuture. Although the political situation in\nSaudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia\nhas historically experienced political\ninstability, and there remains the possibility\nthat the stability will not hold in the future\nor that instability in the larger Middle East\nregion could adversely impact the economy of\nSaudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by\nmilitary developments, government\ninterventions in the marketplace, terrorism,\nextremist attitudes, attempted social or\npolitical reforms, religious differences, or\nother factors. Additionally, anti-Western\nviews held by certain groups in the Middle\nEast may influence government policies\nregarding foreign investment. Further\ndevelopments in U.S. relations with Saudi\nArabia and other Middle-Eastern countries may\naffect these attitudes and policies. The U.S.\nis a significant trading partner of, or\nforeign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a\nresult, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia\nmay be particularly affected by changes in the\nU.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which a Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\n100\n\nCertain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may\noperate in, or have dealings with, countries\nsubject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed\nby the U.S. government and the United Nations\nand/or countries identified by the U.S.\ngovernment as state sponsors of terrorism. As\na result, an issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nwhich operates in, or has dealings with, such\ncountries. A Fund, as an investor in such\nissuers, will be indirectly subject to those\nrisks. Risk of Investing in the Automotive\nSub-Industry. The automotive sub-industry can\nbe highly cyclical, and companies in the\nautomotive sub-industry may suffer periodic\nlosses. The automotive sub-industry is also\nhighly competitive and there may be, at times,\nexcess capacity in the global and domestic\nautomotive sub-industry. Over the last several\ndecades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has\nexperienced periodic downturns; certain\nautomotive companies required stimulus from\nthe U.S. government, while others formed\nstrategic industry alliances in order to\nweather the substantially difficult market\nconditions. In general, the automotive sub-\nindustry is susceptible to labor disputes,\nproduct defect litigation, patent expiration,\nincreased pension liabilities, rise in\nmaterial or component prices and changing\nconsumer tastes. Risk of Investing in the\nBasic Materials Industry. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry could be adversely affected\nby commodity price volatility, inflation,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Capital Goods\nIndustry. Companies in the capital goods\nindustry may be affected by fluctuations in\nthe business cycle and by other factors\naffecting manufacturing demands. Companies in\nthe capital goods industry depend heavily on\ncorporate spending. Companies in the capital\ngoods industry may perform well during times\nof economic expansion, and as economic\nconditions worsen, the demand for capital\ngoods may decrease due to weakening demand,\nworsening business cash flows, tighter credit\ncontrols and deteriorating profitability.\nDuring times of economic volatility, corporate\nspending may fall and adversely affect the\ncapital goods industry. This industry may also\nbe affected by changes in interest rates,\ncorporate tax rates and other government\npolicies. Many capital goods are sold\ninternationally and such companies are subject\nto market conditions in other countries and\nregions. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nCyclical Industry. A Fund may invest in\nconsumer cyclical companies, which rely\nheavily on business cycles and economic\nconditions. Consumer cyclical companies\ninclude automotive manufacturers, retail\ncompanies, and housing-related companies. The\nconsumer cyclical industry can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer tastes and\ntrends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and\nsports arenas, camping and recreational\nequipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-\nrelated services, automobiles, hotels and\nmotels, and fast food and other restaurants)\nare subject to the risk that their products or\nservices may become obsolete quickly. The\nsuccess of these companies can depend heavily\non disposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation.\n\n101\n\nRisk of Investing in the Consumer Goods\nIndustry. Companies in the consumer goods\nindustry include companies involved in the\ndesign, production or distribution of goods\nfor consumers, including food, household,\nhome, personal and office products, clothing\nand textiles. The success of the consumer\ngoods industry is tied closely to the\nperformance of the domestic and international\neconomy, interest rates, exchange rates,\ncompetition, consumer confidence and consumer\ndisposable income. The consumer goods industry\nmay be affected by trends, marketing campaigns\nand other factors affecting consumer demand.\nGovernmental regulation affecting the use of\nvarious food additives may affect the\nprofitability of certain companies in the\nconsumer goods industry. Moreover,\ninternational events may affect food and\nbeverage companies that derive a substantial\nportion of their net income from foreign\ncountries. In addition, tobacco companies may\nbe adversely affected by new laws, regulations\nand litigation. Many consumer goods may be\nmarketed globally, and consumer goods\ncompanies may be affected by the demand and\nmarket conditions in other countries and\nregions. Companies in the consumer goods\nindustry may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and\nconsumer preferences may affect the success of\nconsumer products. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Services Industry. The success of\nfirms in the consumer services industry and\ncertain retailers (including food and\nbeverage, general retailers, media, and travel\nand leisure) is tied closely to the\nperformance of the domestic and international\neconomy, interest rates, exchange rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. The\nconsumer services industry depends heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer\nspending. Companies in the consumer services\nindustry may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the consumer\nservices industry are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. Changes in demographics and consumer\npreferences may affect the success of consumer\nservice providers. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in a\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund\ncould lose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental\n\n102\n\nentities and utilities, governmental budget\nconstraints may have a significant impact on\ncompanies in this sector. The energy sector is\nhighly regulated. Entities operating in the\nenergy sector are subject to significant\nregulation of nearly every aspect of their\noperations by governmental agencies. Such\nregulation can change rapidly or over time in\nboth scope and intensity. Stricter laws,\nregulations or enforcement policies could be\nenacted, which would likely increase\ncompliance costs and may materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of companies\nin the energy sector. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022 led to further\ndisruptions and increased volatility in the\nenergy and commodity futures markets due to\nactual and potential disruptions in the supply\nand demand for certain commodities, including\noil and natural gas. The U.S. and other actors\nhave enacted various sanctions and\nrestrictions on business dealings with Russia,\nwhich include restrictions on imports of oil,\nnatural gas and coal. The effect of the\ncurrent sanctions and restrictions, as well as\nthe extent and duration of the Russian\nmilitary action, additional sanctions and\nassociated market disruptions on the energy\nsector, are impossible to predict and depend\non a number of factors. The effect of these\nevents or any related developments could be\nsignificant and may have a severe adverse\neffect on the performance of a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in the Financials Sector. Companies\nin the financials sector include small,\nregional and money center banks, securities\nbrokerage firms, asset management companies,\nsavings banks and thrift institutions,\nspecialty finance companies ( e.g. , credit\ncard, mortgage providers), insurance and\ninsurance brokerage firms, consumer finance\nfirms, financial conglomerates and foreign\nbanking and financial companies. Most\nfinancial companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which a Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding market share and price competition.\nFinancial companies in foreign countries are\nsubject to market-specific and general\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers. In\naddition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions,\n\n103\n\ncompanies in the financials sector may\nexperience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Insurance Industry.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation in some countries and\ncan be significantly affected by changes in\ninterest rates, general economic conditions,\nprice and marketing competition, the\nimposition of premium rate caps or other\nchanges in government regulation or tax law.\nDifferent segments of the insurance industry\ncan be significantly affected by changes in\nmortality and morbidity rates, environmental\nclean-up costs and catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.\n\n104\n\nRisk of Investing in the Media Sub-Industry.\nCompanies in the media sub-industry may\nencounter distressed cash flows due to the\nneed to commit substantial capital to meet\nincreasing competition, particularly in\nformulating new products and services using\nnew technology. Media companies are subject to\nrisks that include cyclicality of revenues and\nearnings, a potential decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted individuals,\nchanging consumer tastes and interests,\ncompetition in the industry and the potential\nfor increased state and federal regulation.\nAdvertising spending is an important source of\nrevenue for media companies. During economic\ndownturns, advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media companies\ntend to generate less revenue. Risk of\nInvesting in Municipal Securities in the\nUtilities Sector. Certain municipal securities\nare issued by public bodies, including state\nand municipal utility authorities, to, among\nother things, finance the operation or\nexpansion of utility entities. Various future\neconomic and other conditions may adversely\naffect utility entities, including inflation,\nincreases in financing requirements, increases\nin raw material costs and other operating\ncosts, changes in demand for services and the\neffects of environmental and other\ngovernmental regulations. Municipal securities\nthat are issued to finance a particular\nutility project often depend on revenues from\nthat project to make principal and interest\npayments. Adverse conditions and developments\naffecting a particular utility project can\nresult in lower revenues to the issuer of the\nmunicipal securities. Certain utilities are\nsubject to specific risks. Gas utilities are\nsubject to risks of supply conditions and\nincreased competition from other providers of\nutility services. In addition, gas utilities\nare affected by gas prices, which may be\nmagnified to the extent that a gas utility\nenters into long-term contracts for the\npurchase or sale of gas at a fixed price,\nsince such prices may change significantly and\nto the disadvantage of the gas utility. Risk\nof Investing in the Real Estate Industry.\nCompanies in the real estate industry include\ncompanies that invest in real estate, such as\nREITs, real estate holding and operating\ncompanies or real estate development companies\n(collectively, \u201c Real Estate Companies \u201d ).\nInvesting in Real Estate Companies exposes\ninvestors to the risks of owning real estate\ndirectly, as well as to risks that relate\nspecifically to the way in which Real Estate\nCompanies are organized and operated. The real\nestate industry is highly sensitive to general\nand local economic conditions and\ndevelopments, and characterized by intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding.\nInvesting in Real Estate Companies involves\nvarious risks. Some risks that are specific to\nReal Estate Companies are discussed in greater\ndetail below. Concentration Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype. Economic downturns affecting a\nparticular region, industry or property type\nmay lead to a high volume of defaults within a\nshort period. Distressed Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may invest in distressed,\ndefaulted or out-of-favor bank loans.\nIdentification and implementation by a Real\nEstate Company of loan modification and\nrestructure programs involves a high degree of\nuncertainty. Even successful implementation\nmay still require adverse compromises and may\nnot prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies\nmay also invest in other debt instruments that\nmay become non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements,\n\n105\n\nthird-party leasing commissions and other\ncapital expenditures, the income and ability\nof a Real Estate Company to make payments of\nany interest and principal on its debt\nsecurities will be adversely affected. Loan\nForeclosure Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nforeclose on loans that the Real Estate\nCompany originated and/or acquired.\nForeclosure may generate negative publicity\nfor the underlying property that affects its\nmarket value. In addition to the length and\nexpense of such proceedings, the validity of\nthe terms of the applicable loan may not be\nrecognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims\nand defenses asserted by borrowers or other\nlenders may interfere with the enforcement of\nrights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel\nproceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also\ndelay resolution and limit the amount of\nrecovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate\nCompany even where the property underlying the\nloan is liquidated. Management Risk. Real\nEstate Companies are dependent upon management\nskills and may have limited financial\nresources. Real Estate Companies are generally\nnot diversified and may be subject to heavy\ncash flow dependency, default by borrowers and\nvoluntary liquidation. In addition,\ntransactions between Real Estate Companies and\ntheir affiliates may be subject to conflicts\nof interest, which may adversely affect a Real\nEstate Company\u2019s shareholders. A Real Estate\nCompany may also have joint venture\ninvestments in certain of its properties, and,\nconsequently, its ability to control decisions\nrelating to such properties may be limited.\nProperty Risk. Real Estate Companies may be\nsubject to risks relating to functional\nobsolescence or reduced desirability of\nproperties; extended vacancies due to economic\nconditions and tenant bankruptcies;\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or\ncondemnation losses. Real estate income and\nvalues also may be greatly affected by\ndemographic trends, such as population shifts\nor changes in consumer preferences and values,\nor increasing vacancies or declining rents\nresulting from legal, cultural, technological,\nglobal or local economic developments.\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in CMBS may\nalso be junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, a Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Retail Industry. The retail\nindustry may be affected by changes in\ndomestic and international economies, consumer\nconfidence, disposable household income and\nspending, and consumer tastes and preferences.\nCompanies in the retail industry face intense\ncompetition, which may have an adverse effect\non their profitability. The success of\ncompanies in the retail industry may be\nstrongly affected by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns and public\n\n106\n\nperceptions. Companies in the retail industry\nmay be dependent on outside financing, which\nmay be difficult to obtain. Many of these\ncompanies are dependent on third party\nsuppliers and distribution systems. Retail\ncompanies may be unable to protect their\nintellectual property rights or may be liable\nfor infringing the intellectual property\nrights of others. Risk of Investing in\nTechnology Companies. Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and personnel.\nThese companies may face rapid product\nobsolescence as well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product introduction and\ntechnological developments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine learning. Technology\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and distribution\nnetworks as well as issues at third-party\npartners. They are heavily dependent on patent\nand other intellectual property rights, and\nthe loss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their profitability.\nTechnology companies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal action. These\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by,\namong other things, actual or perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities or other defects in\ntheir products and services, which may result\nin lawsuits, government enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs. Risk of Investing\nin the Telecommunications Sector. The\ntelecommunications sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation. The costs of complying\nwith governmental regulations, delays or\nfailure to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively affect the\nbusiness of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the\nTransportation Infrastructure Industry.\nMunicipal securities include, among others,\nbonds payable from fuel taxes and tolls for\nmunicipal toll roads, as well as general\nairport bonds. Issuers in the transportation\ninfrastructure industry can be significantly\naffected by economic changes, fuel prices,\nlabor relations, technology developments,\nexchange rates, industry competition,\ninsurance costs and deteriorating public\ninfrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails,\nports and airports. Municipal securities that\nare issued to finance a particular\ntransportation project often depend on\nrevenues from that project to make principal\nand interest payments. Adverse conditions and\ndevelopments affecting a particular project\ncan result in lower revenues to the issuer of\nthe municipal securities. Other risk factors\nthat may affect the transportation\ninfrastructure industry include the risk of\nincreases in fuel and other operating costs\nand the effects of regulatory changes or other\ngovernment decisions. Risk of Investing in the\nUtilities Sector. The utilities sector may be\nadversely affected by changing commodity\nprices, government regulation stipulating\nrates charged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the construction of\nelectric transmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear generating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\n\n107\n\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation or\ncalculations (in the case of each of the\niShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and\niShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, the\ninformation will relate to each net asset\nvalue per share calculation or calculations).\nIn addition, certain information may also be\nmade available to certain parties: \u2022\nCommunications of Data Files: A Fund may make\navailable through the facilities of the\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c\nNSCC \u201d ) or through posting on the\nwww.iShares.com , prior to the opening of\ntrading on each business day, a list of a\nFund\u2019s holdings (generally pro-rata) that\nAuthorized Participants could deliver to a\nFund to settle purchases of a Fund ( i.e.\nDeposit Securities) or that Authorized\nParticipants would receive from a Fund to\nsettle redemptions of a Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption.\n\n108\n\nBFA employees may also discuss portfolio\nholdings-related information with\nbroker/dealers, in connection with settling a\nFund\u2019s transactions, as may be necessary to\nconduct business in the ordinary course in a\nmanner consistent with the disclosure in the\nFund\u2019s current registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted the index\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe BlackRock Indexes BlackRock High Yield\nSystematic Bond Index The Underlying Index is\nmaintained by the Index Provider. The Index\nProvider will also calculate the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund will use the Underlying Index\npursuant to a licensing agreement with the\nIndex Provider. The license states that the\nIndex Provider must provide the use of the\nUnderlying Index and related intellectual\nproperty at no cost to the Fund.\n\n109\n\nNumber of Components: approximately 255 Index\nDescription. The BlackRock High Yield\nSystematic Bond Index measures the performance\nof U.S. dollar-denominated, high yield\ncorporate bonds for sale in the U.S., as\ndetermined by the index provider. Component\nsecurities include publicly-issued debt of\nU.S. corporations, U.S. dollar-denominated,\npublicly issued debt of non-U.S. corporations\nor similar entities, and bonds offered\npursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act with\nor without registration rights. Components of\nthe Underlying Index primarily include\nsecurities of industrials companies. The bonds\nin the index are referred to as \u201c defensive \u201d\nby comparison to other groupings of high yield\nbonds in market-value-weighted indexes because\nthose included in the Underlying Index possess\nspecific characteristics that the Underlying\nIndex methodology has identified as reducing\nthe risk of default. The securities in the\nUnderlying Index must meet eligibility\ncriteria described in the \u201c Index Methodology\n\u201d section below. The Underlying Index\ndetermines constituent weights based on a\nproprietary methodology which first aims to\nsystematically screen out certain bonds with\nthe highest probability of default (a measure\nof credit quality) and then optimizes to\nimprove risk-adjusted returns by weighting\nmore heavily to bonds with attractive default-\nadjusted spreads (a measure of value) while\nmitigating portfolio risks and limiting\nturnover. Key investment characteristics like\nduration and yield are constrained to be\nwithin a specified range of a broader market-\nvalue-weighted high yield corporate bond\nuniverse. The Underlying Index is rebalanced\non the last business day of each month. Index\nMethodology. Bonds in the Underlying Index are\nselected from the universe of eligible bonds\nusing defined rules. Securities that satisfy\nall the following defined criteria will be\neligible for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex: (i) must be fixed-rate; (ii) must have\na composite rating below investment grade;\n(iii) must be denominated in U.S. dollars;\n(iv) must have a current face amount\noutstanding of at least $350 million; and (v)\nmust have at least one year remaining to final\nmaturity. In determining whether a bond has a\ncomposite rating of below-investment grade,\nratings from Moody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings, or\nFitch are considered. The securities in the\nUnderlying Index must be rated below-\ninvestment grade, which is below Baa3 by\nMoody\u2019s or below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or\nFitch. Eligibility in the Underlying Index is\ndetermined by the middle of the three\navailable ratings. When a rating from only two\nagencies is available, the lower rating is\nused. When a rating from only one agency is\navailable, that rating is used to determine\neligibility in the Underlying Index. The\nUnderlying Index determines constituent\nweights by optimizing to maximize risk-\nadjusted returns, and the weights must be\nwithin a specified range around a broader\nmarket-value-weighted universe of high yield\ncorporate bonds. Component Selection Criteria.\nEligible bonds are chosen by applying the\neligibility rules and optimization methodology\nlisted above. There is no maximum number of\nbond issues included per eligible issuer. The\nUnderlying Index is updated monthly on the\nlast business day of each month. BlackRock\nInvestment Grade Systematic Bond Index The\nUnderlying Index is maintained by the Index\nProvider. The Index Provider will also\ncalculate the Underlying Index. The Fund will\nuse the Underlying Index pursuant to a\nlicensing agreement with the Index Provider.\nThe license states that the Index Provider\nmust provide the use of the Underlying Index\nand related intellectual property at no cost\nto the Fund. Number of Components:\napproximately 424 Index Description. The\nBlackRock Investment Grade Systematic Bond\nIndex measures the performance of U.S. dollar-\ndenominated, investment-grade corporate bonds\nfor sale in the U.S., as determined by the\nIndex Provider. Component securities include\npublicly-issued debt of U.S. corporations and\nU.S. dollar-denominated, publicly issued debt\nof non-U.S. corporations or similar entities.\nComponents of the Underlying Index primarily\ninclude securities of financials and\nindustrials companies. The bonds in the index\nare referred to as \u201c enhanced \u201d by comparison\nto other groupings of investment grade bonds\nin market-value-weighted indexes because those\nincluded in the Underlying Index possess\nspecific characteristics that the Underlying\nIndex methodology has identified as providing\nsuperior risk-adjusted and total returns over\nlonger periods of time. The securities in the\nUnderlying Index must meet eligibility\ncriteria described in the \u201c Index Methodology\n\u201d section below. The Underlying Index\ndetermines constituent weights based on a\nproprietary methodology which first aims to\nsystematically screen out certain bonds with\nthe highest probability of default (a measure\nof credit quality) and then optimizes to\nimprove risk-adjusted returns by weighting\nmore heavily to bonds with attractive default-\nadjusted spreads (a measure of value) while\nmitigating portfolio risks and limiting\nturnover. This methodology, unlike the\nmethodologies used by traditional\n\n110\n\ncapitalization-weighted bond indexes, selects\na portion of the component bonds from the\nbroader universe of investment-grade bonds\nbased on the application of analytics\nmeasuring the probability of default. The\nresulting grouping of bonds is referred to as\n\u201c enhanced, \u201d by comparison to other groupings\nof investment-grade bonds, because the\nUnderlying Index seeks to provide superior\nrisk-adjusted and total returns over longer\nperiods of time than a comparable market\ncapitalization weighted index. Key investment\ncharacteristics like duration are constrained\nto be within a specified range of a broader\nmarket-value-weighted investment-grade bond\nuniverse. The Underlying Index is rebalanced\non the last business day of each month. Index\nMethodology. Bonds in the Underlying Index are\nselected from the universe of eligible bonds\nusing defined rules. Securities that satisfy\nall the following defined criteria will be\neligible for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex: (i) must be fixed-rate, although they\ncan carry a coupon that steps up ( i.e. ,\nchanges according to a predetermined\nschedule); (ii) must have a composite rating\nof investment grade; (iii) must be denominated\nin U.S. dollars; (iv) must have a current face\namount outstanding of at least $500 million or\nmore; and (v) must have at least one year\nremaining to final maturity. Fixed-to-Float\nbonds are eligible, provided that there is a\nminimum of 12 months until the transition date\nto the floating rate period. In determining\nwhether a bond has an average rating of\ninvestment grade, ratings from Moody\u2019s, S&P\nGlobal Ratings, or Fitch are considered.\nSecurities in the Underlying Index must be\nrated investment grade or higher using the\nmiddle rating of Moody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings,\nor Fitch. Eligibility in the Underlying Index\nis determined by the middle of the three\navailable ratings. When a rating from only two\nagencies is available, the lower ( \u201c more\nconservative \u201d ) rating is used. When a rating\nfrom only one agency is available, that rating\nis used to determine eligibility in the\nUnderlying Index. The Underlying Index\ndetermines constituent weights by optimizing\nto maximize risk-adjusted returns, and the\nweights must be within a specified range\naround a broader market-value-weighted\nuniverse of investment grade corporate bonds.\nComponent Selection Criteria. Eligible bonds\nare chosen by applying the eligibility rules\nand optimization methodology listed above.\nThere is no maximum number of bond issues\nincluded per eligible issuer. The Underlying\nIndex is updated monthly on the last business\nday of each month. The Bloomberg Indexes The\nBloomberg Indexes are maintained by Bloomberg\nFinance L.P. and its affiliates ( \u201c Bloomberg\n\u201d ), which is the index provider and is not\naffiliated with BFA.

To use the\nBloomberg MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index,\nBloomberg MSCI US Corporate 1-5 Year ESG Focus\nIndex, Bloomberg MSCI US Corporate ESG Focus\nIndex and Bloomberg MSCI US Universal Choice\nESG Screened Index, BFA or its affiliates have\nentered into a license agreement with MSCI ESG\nResearch LLC ( \u201c MSCI ESG Research \u201d ), which\nmay license the Bloomberg MSCI US Aggregate\nESG Focus Index, Bloomberg MSCI US Corporate\n1-5 Year ESG Focus Index, Bloomberg MSCI US\nCorporate ESG Focus Index and Bloomberg MSCI\nUS Universal Choice ESG Screened Index\npursuant to its agreement with Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (a subsidiary of Bloomberg)\nor an affiliate. Bloomberg MSCI US Aggregate\nESG Focus Index Number of Components:\napproximately 8,088 Index Description. The\nBloomberg MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index,\nthe Underlying Index, is designed to maximize\nexposure to favorable environmental, social\nand governance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) practices while\nseeking to exhibit risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the\nBloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, the parent\nindex. The Underlying Index is constructed by\nselecting constituents from the parent index\nand applying an optimization process to\ncertain constituents using ESG rating inputs\nfrom MSCI ESG Research in an effort to\nmaximize exposure to ESG factors for a target\ntracking error constraint of 10 basis points\nrelative to the parent index. To construct the\nUnderlying Index, the Fund\u2019s index provider\nbegins with the parent index and replicates\nits U.S. Treasury bond, MBS, CMBS and ABS\nexposures. These exposures are preserved at\nthe weights of the parent index and are not\nsubject to the index provider\u2019s optimization\nprocess, which is a quantitative process that\nseeks to determine optimal weights for\nsecurities to maximize exposure to securities\nof entities with higher MSCI ESG Research\nratings subject to seeking to maintain risk\nand return characteristics similar to the\nparent index. For the remaining constituents\nof the parent index, the index provider\nexcludes securities of entities without an\nMSCI ESG Research rating and: \u2022 tobacco\nproducers or companies with 15% or more of\ntheir revenue derived from tobacco products;\n\n111\n\n\u2022 civilian firearms producers or retailers\nthat derive 5% or more of their revenue, or\nmore than $20 million in revenue, from\ncivilian firearms-related products; \u2022 cluster\nbomb, landmine, depleted uranium, or\nchemical/biological weapon systems or\ncomponents manufacturers; and \u2022 any issuer\nwith 5% or more revenue derived from thermal\ncoal (power and heat) or oil sands. The index\nprovider also excludes securities of entities\ninvolved in very severe business controversies\n(as determined by MSCI ESG Research), and then\nfollows the index provider\u2019s optimization\nprocess. MSCI ESG Research identifies key ESG\ncontroversies, including, among other things,\nissues involving: (i) the environment ( e.g. ,\nbiodiversity and land use, toxic emissions and\nwaste, energy and climate change, water\nstress, non-hazardous operational waste, and\nsupply chain management); (ii) human rights\nand communities ( e.g. , impact on local\ncommunities, human rights concerns, and civil\nliberties); (iii) labor rights and supply\nchains ( e.g. , child labor, collective\nbargaining and union, health and safety,\ndiscrimination and workforce diversity, and\nlabor management relations); (iv) customers (\ne.g. , anti-competitive practices, customer\nrelations, privacy and data security, product\nsafety and quality, and marketing and\nadvertising); and (v) governance ( e.g. ,\nbribery and fraud, governance structures, and\ncontroversial investments). MSCI ESG Research\nthen rates each entity\u2019s exposure to these ESG\nissues and evaluates the extent to which the\nentity has created strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Entities\nare scored by MSCI ESG Research based on both\ntheir risk exposure and risk management, and\nthen ranked in comparison to their industry\npeers. Using MSCI ESG Research\u2019s ESG ratings,\nthe index provider then follows its\noptimization process. Index Methodology. The\nUnderlying Index consists of U.S. dollar-\ndenominated, investment-grade bonds from\nissuers generally evaluated for favorable ESG\npractices (as determined by MSCI ESG Research)\nwhile seeking to exhibit risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the parent\nindex. The securities in the Underlying Index\nmust have remaining maturities of greater than\nor equal to one year (except for ABS and CMBS,\nwhich must have a remaining average life of at\nleast one year, and for MBS, which must have a\nweighted average maturity of at least one\nyear). In addition, the securities included in\nthe Underlying Index must be fixed-rate,\ntaxable securities. The securities in the\nUnderlying Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month. Bloomberg MSCI US\nCorporate 1-5 Year ESG Focus Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 1,416 Index\nDescription. The Bloomberg MSCI US Corporate\n1-5 Year ESG Focus Index, the Underlying\nIndex, is designed to maximize exposure to\npositive ESG characteristics while seeking to\nexhibit risk and return characteristics\nsimilar to those of the Bloomberg US Corporate\n1-5 Years Index, the parent index. The\nUnderlying Index is constructed by selecting\nconstituents from the parent index through an\noptimization process using ESG rating inputs\nfrom MSCI ESG Research in an effort to\nmaximize exposure to ESG factors for a target\ntracking error constraint of 10 basis points\nrelative to the parent index. The Fund\u2019s index\nprovider begins with the parent index,\nexcludes securities of companies without an\nMSCI ESG Research rating and: \u2022 tobacco\nproducers or companies with 15% or more of\ntheir revenue derived from tobacco products; \u2022\ncivilian firearms producers or retailers that\nderive 5% or more of their revenue, or more\nthan $20 million in revenue, from civilian\nfirearms-related products; \u2022 cluster bomb,\nlandmine, depleted uranium, or\nchemical/biological weapon systems or\ncomponents manufacturers; and \u2022 any issuer\nwith 5% or more revenue derived from thermal\ncoal (power and heat) or oil sands.

Companies are scored by\nMSCI ESG Research based on both their risk\nexposure and risk management, and then ranked\nin comparison to their industry peers. Using\nMSCI ESG Research\u2019s ESG ratings, the index\nprovider then follows a quantitative process\nin an effort to determine optimal weights for\nsecurities to maximize exposure to securities\nof companies with higher ESG ratings subject\nto seeking to maintain risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the parent\nindex. Index Methodology. The Underlying Index\nconsists of U.S. dollar-denominated,\ninvestment-grade corporate bonds having\nremaining maturities between one and five\nyears and issued by companies that have\npositive ESG characteristics (as determined by\nMSCI ESG Research ratings). In addition, the\nsecurities included in the Underlying Index\nmust be fixed-rate, taxable corporate\nsecurities. Excluded from the Underlying Index\ninclude, but are not limited to, structured\nnotes, private placements and floating rate\nsecurities. The Underlying Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in\nthe Underlying Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month.

The Underlying Index is constructed by\nselecting constituents from the parent index\nthrough an optimization process using ESG\nrating inputs from MSCI ESG Research in an\neffort to maximize exposure to ESG factors for\na target tracking error constraint of 10 basis\npoints relative to the parent index. The\nFund\u2019s index provider begins with the parent\nindex, excludes companies without an MSCI ESG\nResearch rating and: \u2022 tobacco producers or\ncompanies with 15% or more of their revenue\nderived from tobacco products; \u2022 civilian\nfirearms producers or retailers that derive 5%\nor more of their revenue, or more than $20\nmillion in revenue, from civilian firearms-\nrelated products; \u2022 cluster bomb, landmine,\ndepleted uranium, or chemical/biological\nweapon systems or components manufacturers;\nand \u2022 any issuer with 5% or more revenue\nderived from thermal coal (power and heat) or\noil sands. The index provider also excludes\ncompanies involved in very severe business\ncontroversies (as determined by MSCI ESG\nResearch), and then follows the index\nprovider\u2019s optimization process. MSCI ESG\nResearch identifies key ESG controversies,\nincluding, among other things, issues\ninvolving: (i) the environment ( e.g.,\nbiodiversity and land use, toxic emissions and\nwaste, energy and climate change, water\nstress, non-hazardous operational waste, and\nsupply chain management); (ii) human rights\nand communities ( e.g., impact on local\ncommunities, human rights concerns, and civil\nliberties); (iii) labor rights and supply\nchains ( e.g., child labor, collective\nbargaining and union, health and safety,\ndiscrimination and workforce diversity, and\nlabor management relations); (iv) customers (\ne.g., anti-competitive practices, customer\nrelations, privacy and data security, product\nsafety and quality, and marketing and\nadvertising); and (v) governance ( e.g.,\nbribery and fraud, governance structures, and\ncontroversial investments).

Bloomberg U.S. Agency Bond Index\n\n113\n\nNumber of Components: approximately 393 Index\nDescription. The Bloomberg U.S. Agency Bond\nIndex measures the performance of the agency\nsector of the U.S. government bond market and\nis composed of investment-grade U.S. dollar-\ndenominated publicly-issued government agency\nbonds or debentures. The Underlying Index\nincludes callable and non-callable securities\nissued by U.S. government agencies, quasi-\nfederal corporations (as described under Index\nMethodology below), and corporate or non-U.S.\ndebt guaranteed by the U.S. government. In\naddition, the securities in the Underlying\nIndex must be fixed-rate and non-convertible\nand have $300 million or more of outstanding\nface value. As of February 29, 2024,\napproximately 73.04% of the composite market\nvalue of the bonds represented in the\nUnderlying Index was in the form of U.S.\nagency debentures. The largest issues within\nthe Underlying Index were FHLB, Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, with a composite market value\nweight in the Underlying Index of\napproximately 26.63%, 22.87%, and 23.53%,\nrespectively. Index Methodology. The\nUnderlying Index measures the performance of\nboth callable and non-callable U.S. dollar-\ndenominated government agency debentures,\nincluding securities of the following\ncategories: \u2022 U.S. government guaranteed\nsecurities: corporate and non-U.S. issuances\nthat carry direct guarantees from the U.S.\ngovernment; \u2022 U.S. government owned, not\nguaranteed, securities: issuances of quasi-\nfederal corporations ( i.e. , entities that\nare partially or wholly-owned by the U.S.\ngovernment); such issuances generally carry no\nexplicit guarantee of repayment from the U.S.\ngovernment; and \u2022 U.S. government sponsored\nsecurities: issuances of U.S. government\nsponsored entities (including Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac), which are not 100% government\nowned, but carry out government policies and\nbenefit from implied involvement of central\ngovernments, such as by benefiting from\ncertain government subsidies, credit\nprovisions, or other government support; such\nissuances generally have no guarantees from\nthe U.S. government. The Underlying Index is\nmarket value weighted and the securities in\nthe Underlying Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month. The Underlying\nIndex represents the U.S. Agency portion of\nthe Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, whose\neligible universe is defined by total market\nissuance, meeting the selection criteria\nmentioned above. Index Maintenance. The\nUnderlying Index constituents are reset on the\nlast business day of each month and remain\nstatic throughout the month. The universe of\nUnderlying Index constituents adjust for\nsecurities that become ineligible for\ninclusion in an Underlying Index during the\nmonth ( e.g. , because of downgrades or called\nbonds) or for issues that are newly eligible (\ne.g. , up-grades or newly issued bonds) on the\nlast business day of each month. The Bloomberg\nIndexes are valued using end of day bid side\nprices, as marked by Bloomberg. Intra-month\ncash flows contribute to monthly returns, but\nthey are not reinvested during the month and\ndo not earn a reinvestment return. Total\nreturns are calculated based on the sum of\nprice changes, gain/loss on repayments of\nprincipal, and coupon received or accrued,\nexpressed as a percentage of beginning market\nvalue. The Bloomberg Indexes are calculated\nonce a day and are available from major data\nvendors. Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 13,534\nIndex Description.

Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS\noccur through standardized contracts for\nfuture delivery in which the exact mortgage\npools to be delivered are not specified until\na few days prior to settlement (TBA\ntransactions). The Fund may enter into such\ncontracts on a regular basis. The Fund,\npending settlement of such contracts, will\ninvest its assets in high-quality, liquid\nshort-term instruments, including shares of\nBlackRock Cash Funds. The Fund will assume its\npro rata share of the fees and expenses of any\nmoney market fund that it may invest in, in\naddition to the Fund's own fees and expenses.\nThe Fund may also acquire interests in\nmortgage pools through means other than such\nstandardized contracts for future delivery.\nBloomberg U.S. Government/Credit Bond Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 9,467\nIndex Description.

The\nFund, pending\n\n115\n\nsettlement of such contracts, will invest its\nassets in liquid, short-term instruments,\nincluding shares of BlackRock Cash Funds. The\nFund will assume its pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses of any money market fund\nthat it may invest in, in addition to the\nFund's own fees and expenses. The Fund may\nalso acquire interests in mortgage pools\nthrough means other than such standardized\ncontracts for future delivery. Bloomberg U.S.\nUniversal 5-10 Year Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 6,301 Index\nDescription. The Bloomberg U.S. Universal 5-10\nYear Index measures the performance of U.S.\ndollar-denominated taxable bonds that are\nrated either investment-grade or high yield\nwith remaining effective maturities between\nfive and ten years. Index Methodology. The\nUnderlying Index includes U.S. Treasury bonds,\ngovernment-related bonds ( i.e. , U.S. and\nnon-U.S. agencies, sovereign, quasi-sovereign,\nsupranational and local authority debt),\ninvestment-grade and high yield U.S. corporate\nbonds, MBS, CMBS, ABS, Eurodollar bonds ( i.e.\n, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by\nforeign issuers outside the U.S.), bonds\nregistered with the SEC or exempt from\nregistration at the time of issuance, or\noffered pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933\nAct with or without registration rights ( \u201c\nRule 144A Bonds \u201d ) and emerging market bonds.\nThe securities in the Underlying Index must be\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and non-\nconvertible.

In addition, an issuing\nentity\u2019s general obligation debt is considered\nto be issued by a separate, distinct issuer\nfrom revenue bonds issued by the same entity.\nPre-refunded securities are not included in\nissuer weights and are not subject to any\nissuer caps, nor do they receive\nredistributions of any excess weights. Accrued\ninterest is calculated assuming next-day\nsettlement. Cash flows from bond payments,\nincluding interest coupons and principal\nrepayments of maturing or called bonds that\nare received during the month, are retained in\nthe index until the end of the month and then\nare removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash\ndoes not earn any reinvestment income while it\nis held in the index. Information concerning\nconstituent bond prices, timing and\nconventions and index governance and\nadministration is provided in the ICE Bond\nIndex Methodologies, which can be accessed on\nICE\u2019s public website\n(https://indices.theice.com), or by sending a\nrequest to iceindices@theice.com. Each index\nis rebalanced on the last calendar day of the\nmonth, based on information available up to\nand including the third business day before\nthe last business day of the month. New issues\nmust settle on or before the following\ncalendar month end rebalancing date in order\nto qualify for the coming month ( e.g. , an\nissue must settle on or before November 30 in\norder to be included in the index on October\n31). No changes are made to constituent\nholdings other than on month end rebalancing\ndates. ICE AMT-Free California Municipal Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 3,887\nIndex Description.

The\nMarkit iBoxx Indexes iBoxx MSCI ESG Advanced\nUSD Liquid Investment Grade Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 1,793 Index\nDescription. The iBoxx MSCI ESG Advanced USD\nLiquid Investment Grade Index is designed to\napply climate-based and values-based screens\nto the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Investment\nGrade Index (the \u201c parent index \u201d ), and also\nis designed to select issuers with average or\nabove ESG ratings relative to their sector\npeers, as identified by MSCI ESG Research. The\nUnderlying Index is a modified market value\nweighted index with a cap on each issuer of 3%\nof the Underlying Index at each monthly\nrebalancing. Bonds with the following\ncharacteristics are included in the Underlying\nIndex: fixed coupon bonds; step-up bonds;\nsinking funds and amortizing bonds; medium\nterm notes; certain senior fixed-to-floating\nrate bonds; Rule 144A offerings with a\nregistration right; callable bonds; and\nputable bonds. The following bond types are\nspecifically excluded from the Underlying\nIndex: preferred shares; optionally and\nmandatory convertible bonds; subordinated bank\nor insurance debt with mandatory conversion\nfeatures; bonds with other equity features\nattached; perpetual bonds; certain fixed-to-\nfloater bonds; floating rate notes; pay-in\nkind bonds; zero coupon bonds; zero step-ups;\nbonds with differences between accrual and\ncoupon payment periods; private placements;\nand retail bonds. Index Methodology. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, Markit begins\nwith the parent index and then applies a\nseries of climate-based and values-based\nscreens. The parent index is designed to\nreflect the performance of U.S. dollar-\ndenominated investment grade corporate bonds\nthat: (i) are issued by companies domiciled in\ncountries classified as developed markets by\nMarkit; (ii) have an average rating of\ninvestment grade (ratings from Fitch, Moody\u2019s,\nor S&P Global Ratings are considered; if more\nthan one agency provides a rating, the average\nrating is attached to the bond); (iii) have at\nleast $750 million of outstanding face value\nfor the specific bond issue; (iv) are from\nissuers with at least $2 billion outstanding\nface value of all of the issuer's bonds\neligible for inclusion in the parent index;\nand (v) have at least three years to maturity\nat rebalance (three years and six months to\nmaturity for new index insertions). As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, the Index Provider\nclassifies the following countries as\ndeveloped markets: Andorra, Australia,\nAustria, the Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei\nDarussalam, Canada, Cayman Islands, Cyprus,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nHong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao,\nMalta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the\nU.S.\n\n124\n\nThe climate-based screens remove issuers with\nan industry tie to fossil fuels ( e.g .,\nthermal coal, oil, and gas) including reserve\nownership, related revenues and power\ngeneration (as determined by MSCI ESG\nResearch); issuers classified by IHS Markit in\nthe Oil and Gas Market Sector; and issuers\nwith MSCI Environmental controversies scores\nbelow two (2). The values-based screens remove\na variety of controversial business activities\n(as determined by MSCI ESG Research) including\nadult entertainment, alcohol, civilian\nfirearms, controversial weapons, conventional\nweapons, for profit prisons, gambling,\ngenetically modified organisms, nuclear power,\nnuclear weapons, palm oil, predatory lending,\nand tobacco based on revenue or percentage of\nrevenue thresholds for certain categories (\ne.g . $500 million or 50%) and categorical\nexclusions for others ( e.g. nuclear weapons).\nThe values-based screens also remove issuers\nviolating the United Nations Global Compact.\nAdditionally, the index removes issuers with a\nMSCI ESG ratings below BBB and issuers with a\nMSCI ESG controversies score of less than one\n(1). To determine if companies are involved in\nESG controversies, MSCI assesses the possible\nnegative environmental, social, and/or\ngovernance impact of a company\u2019s operations or\nproducts on a scale from zero to ten, with\nzero being the most severe controversy rating.\nTo determine if companies are involved in\nenvironmental controversies, MSCI assesses the\npossible impact of a company\u2019s operations or\nproducts in environmental issues such as\nenergy and climate change, land use and\nbiodiversity, toxic emissions and waste, water\nstress and operational waste. The impact is\nrated on a scale from zero to ten, with zero\nbeing the most severe controversy rating. To\ndetermine ESG ratings, MSCI rates the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities on a scale of \u201c\nCCC \u201d (lowest) to \u201c AAA \u201d (highest). MSCI\nevaluates a company\u2019s risks and opportunities\nusing a sector-specific ESG Key Issues ( \u201c Key\nIssues \u201d ) ( e.g ., carbon emissions)\nselection and weighting model. Each company is\nscored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being\nthe highest, for each Key Issue before being\nprovided an ESG rating based on average Key\nIssue score. After applying the criteria\nmentioned above, the remaining securities are\nweighted based on market capitalization, with\nan issuer cap of 3% of the Underlying Index.\nThe securities in the Underlying Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each\nmonth.

The iBoxx USD Liquid Investment\nGrade BBB 0+ Index is designed to reflect the\nperformance of BBB (or its equivalent) fixed\nrate U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by\nU.S. and non-U.S. corporate issuers (as\ndetermined by Markit. Securities of varying\nmaturities are eligible for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. The Underlying Index offers\nexposure to liquid (according to Markit\u2019s\nliquidity screens, which could vary from other\nmeasures of liquidity) investment-grade\ncorporate bonds and is rebalanced on a monthly\nbasis. Only bonds from large issuers with at\nleast $1 billion in aggregate outstanding\nissuance and $500 million face value per bond\nare included in the Underlying Index. The\nUnderlying Index uses a modified market-value\nweighted methodology with a cap on each issuer\nof 3%. Index Methodology. Bonds in the\nUnderlying Index are selected from the\nuniverse of eligible bonds using defined\nrules. Currently, the bonds eligible for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index include\nfixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated corporate\nbonds that: (i) are issued by issuers\ndomiciled in the countries classified as\ndeveloped markets by the index provider; (ii)\nare rated BBB, or equivalently, by Fitch,\nMoody\u2019s, or S&P Global Ratings; (iii) are from\nissuers with at least $1 billion aggregate\noutstanding face value; (iv) have at least\n$500 million of outstanding face value; (v)\nhave a time to maturity of at least one year\nat issuance; and (vi) have at least six months\nto maturity for new index insertions. However,\nexisting bonds in the index are held to\nmaturity. Component Selection Criteria.\nEligible bonds are chosen by applying the\neligibility rules listed above. The Underlying\nIndex is a modified market-value weighted\nindex with a cap on each issuer at 3%. There\nis no maximum number of bond issues per issuer\neligible, but to avoid an over-concentration\nin any single-issuer, the methodology caps\nsingle-issuer exposure to no more than 3% of\nthe index weight. The Underlying Index is\nupdated monthly on the last business day of\neach month. The composition of the Underlying\nIndex is held constant for any given calendar\nmonth to ensure continuity during the month\nand to avoid jumps unrelated to the price\nmovements of the bonds. The inclusion and\nexclusion criteria above are applied at month-\nend. Bonds that were in the Underlying Index,\nbut that no longer satisfy all the criteria at\nmonth-end, will be removed from the Underlying\nIndex. A bond that drops out of the Underlying\nIndex at the rebalancing day is excluded\n\n127\n\nfrom reentering the index for a three-month\nperiod. The rule for the lockout period takes\nprecedence over the other rules for the\nUnderlying Index selection. A locked out bond\nwill not be selected, even if it qualifies for\nthe index. If a bond becomes eligible in the\nmiddle of the month, it will still need to\nsatisfy the criteria at the end of the month,\nand can be included only upon rebalancing at\nmonth-end. Any bond that enters the Underlying\nIndex must remain in the Underlying Index for\na minimum of six months provided it is not\ndowngraded to sub-investment grade, defaulted\nor fully redeemed in that period. Existing\nbonds in the Underlying Index that receive a\nrating upgrade can remain in the index if the\nsix-month minimum has not been satisfied. When\na bond is called, it remains in the Underlying\nIndex at its call price until the end of the\nmonth, after which it is removed. Changes in\nissue size that take place during the month\nare taken into consideration only at the next\nrebalancing date.

The Markit iBoxx \u00ae USD Liquid\nInvestment Grade Index measures the\nperformance as of February 29, 2024, of\napproximately 2,748 highly liquid investment-\ngrade corporate bonds. The Underlying Index is\na rules-based index consisting of highly\nliquid, investment-grade, U.S. dollar-\ndenominated corporate bonds that seeks to\nmaximize liquidity while maintaining\nrepresentation of the broader corporate bond\nmarket. Index Methodology. The Underlying\nIndex is a subset of the Markit iBoxx USD\nCorporate Bond Index, which as of February 29,\n2024 is an index of 7,936 investment-grade\nbonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are\nselected from the universe of eligible bonds\nin the Markit iBoxx USD Corporate Bond Index\nusing defined rules. Currently, the bonds\neligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index\nconsist of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate\nbonds that: (i) are issued by companies\ndomiciled in the countries classified as\ndeveloped markets by the index provider; (ii)\nhave an average rating of investment grade\n(ratings from Fitch, Moody\u2019s, or S&P Global\nRatings are considered; if more than one\nagency provides a rating, the average rating\nis attached to the bond); (iii) are from\nissuers with at least $2 billion outstanding\nface value; (iv) have at least $750 million of\noutstanding face value; (v) have at least\nthree years to maturity; and (vi) have at\nleast three years and 6 months to maturity for\nnew index insertions. Component Selection\nCriteria. Eligible bonds are chosen by\napplying the eligibility rules listed above.\nThe Underlying Index is a modified market\nvalue weighted index with a cap on each issuer\nat 3%. The number of bonds in the Underlying\nIndex may change and there is no constraint on\nthe number of index constituents. There is no\nmaximum number of bond issues per issuer\neligible, but to avoid an over-concentration\nin any single-issuer, the methodology caps\nsingle-issuer exposure to no\n\n128\n\nmore than 3% of the index weight, calculated\non the last business day of each month. The\nUnderlying Index is updated monthly on the\nlast business day of each month. The\ncomposition of the Underlying Index is held\nconstant for any given calendar month to\nensure continuity during the month and to\navoid jumps unrelated to the price movements\nof the bonds. The inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria above are applied at month-end, after\nthe close of business. Bonds that were in the\nUnderlying Index, but that no longer satisfy\nall the criteria at month-end, will be removed\nfrom the Underlying Index. If a bond becomes\neligible in the middle of the month, it will\nstill need to satisfy the criteria at the end\nof the month, and can be included only upon\nrebalancing at month-end. When a bond is\ncalled, it remains in the Underlying Index at\nits call price until the end of the month,\nafter which it is removed. Changes in issue\nsize that take place during the month are\ntaken into consideration only at the next\nrebalancing date.

Investment Policies The Board\nhas adopted as fundamental policies the\nfollowing numbered investment policies, which\ncannot be changed without the approval of the\nholders of a majority of the applicable Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities. A vote of a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof a Fund is defined in the 1940 Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. Each Fund has also adopted\ncertain non-fundamental investment policies,\nincluding its investment objective. Non-\nfundamental investment policies may be changed\nby the Board without shareholder approval.\nTherefore, each Fund may change its investment\nobjective and its Underlying Index without\nshareholder approval.

With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\neach Fund's industry classifications, each\nFund currently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits each Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires each Fund to maintain at all\ntimes an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300%\nof the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of\neach Fund's total assets (including amounts\nborrowed), minus liabilities other than\nborrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of\nall borrowings. Borrowing money to increase\nportfolio holdings is known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d\nCertain trading practices and investments,\nsuch as reverse repurchase agreements, may be\nconsidered to be borrowings or involve\nleverage and thus are subject to the\nInvestment Company Act restrictions. In\naccordance with Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act, when each Fund engages\nin reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions, the Fund may either\n(i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law.\n\n131\n\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to lending set forth in (7) above,\nthe Investment Company Act does not prohibit\neach Fund from making loans (including lending\nits securities); however, SEC staff\ninterpretations currently prohibit funds from\nlending more than one-third of their total\nassets (including lending its securities),\nexcept through the purchase of debt\nobligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies The\niShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares\n25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares BBB\nRated Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10\nYear USD Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\nESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF,\niShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond\nETF, iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and\niShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF.\nEach Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy\nnot to make short sales of securities or\nmaintain a short position, except to the\nextent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and\nSAI, as amended from time to time, and\napplicable law.

BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid\ninvestments pursuant to the Liquidity Program.\nExcept with regard to the fundamental policy\nrelating to senior securities set forth in (3)\nabove for all Funds, if any percentage\nrestriction described above is complied with\nat the time of an investment, a later increase\nor decrease in percentage resulting from a\nchange in values of assets will not constitute\na violation of such restriction. Under normal\ncircumstances (i) each of the iShares National\nMuni Bond ETF and the iShares Short-Term\nNational Muni Bond ETF will invest at least\n80% of the value of its net assets, plus the\namount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in investments the income of which\nis free from federal income tax, including\nAMT; (ii) the iShares California Muni Bond ETF\nwill invest at least 80% of the value of its\nnet assets, plus the amount of any borrowings\nfor investment purposes, in investments the\nincome of which is free from federal income\ntax, including AMT, and California income tax;\nand (iii) the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF\nwill invest at least 80% of the value of its\nnet assets, plus the amount of any borrowings\nfor investment purposes, in investments the\nincome of which is free from federal income\ntax, including AMT, and New York income tax.\nThese policies are fundamental policies of the\nMunicipal Bond Funds and may not be changed\nwithout a vote of a majority of each Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities, as defined in\nthe 1940 Act.

The iShares\nESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF has adopted\na non-fundamental policy to invest, under\nnormal circumstances, at least 80% of the\nvalue of its net assets, plus the amount of\nany borrowings for investment purposes, in the\ncomponent securities in the Fund's Underlying\nIndex and in TBA transactions with respect to\nthe percentage of its Underlying Index that\nconsists of mortgage pass-through securities.\nThe iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and\niShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF have\n\n132\n\nadopted an additional non-fundamental policy\nunder which the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond\nETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF,\nunder normal circumstances, will invest, at\nleast 80% of its net assets, plus the amount\nof any borrowings for investment purposes, in\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. The iShares 0-3\nMonth Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year\nTreasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares BBB Rated\nCorporate Bond ETF and iShares ESG Advanced\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF have\nadopted a non-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act\nto invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in the component securities in the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. The iShares ESG\nAdvanced Total USD Bond Market ETF has adopted\na non-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act to invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of the value of\nits net assets, plus the amount of any\nborrowings for investment purposes, in\ncomponent securities in the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex and in TBA transactions with respect to\nthe percentage of the Underlying Index that\nconsists of mortgage pass-through securities.\nThe iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and\niShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF\nhave adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act to invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of the value of\nits net assets, plus the amount of any\nborrowings for investment purposes, in\nsecurities in its Underlying Index and in TBA\ntransactions with respect to the percentage of\nits Underlying Index (if any) that consists of\nmortgage pass-through securities. Each Fund\nalso has adopted a policy to provide its\nshareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 prior\nwritten notice of any change in such policy.\nIf, subsequent to an investment, an 80%\nrequirement is no longer met, a Fund\u2019s future\ninvestments will be made in a manner that will\nbring the Fund into compliance with this\npolicy. Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to purchase securities\nof other investment companies, except to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter\nof policy, however, a Fund will not purchase\nshares of any registered open-end investment\ncompany or registered unit investment trust,\nin reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the\n\u201c fund of funds \u201d provisions) of the 1940 Act,\nat any time the Fund has knowledge that its\nshares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder each Fund's fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of each Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in each Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require each Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange.\n\n133\n\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Funds, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Funds\nrests with the Board. The Board has engaged\nBFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing BFA\nand other service providers in the operations\nof the Funds in accordance with the provisions\nof the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of\nstate and other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter.\nThe Board is currently composed of eleven\nmembers, nine of whom are Independent\nTrustees. The Board currently conducts regular\nin person meetings four times a year. In\naddition, the Board frequently holds special\nin person or telephonic meetings or informal\nconference calls to discuss specific matters\nthat may arise or require action between\nregular meetings. The Independent Trustees\nmeet regularly outside the presence of\nmanagement, in executive session or with other\nservice providers to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n141\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Funds'\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFunds. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such\n\n159\n\ntransactions. On any occasion when a Fund\nparticipates in a cross trade, BlackRock will\ncomply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock.\n\n160\n\nBlackRock has entered into an arrangement with\nMarkit Indices Limited, the index provider for\nunderlying fixed-income indexes used by\ncertain iShares funds, related to derivative\nfixed-income products that are based on such\niShares funds. BlackRock may receive certain\npayments for licensing intellectual property\nbelonging to BlackRock and for facilitating\nthe provision of data in connection with such\nderivative products, which may include\npayments based on the trading volumes of, or\nrevenues generated by, the derivative\nproducts. However, BlackRock will not receive\nany such payments on those derivative products\nutilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds\nor accounts. Other funds and accounts managed\nby BlackRock may from time to time transact in\nsuch derivative products, which could\ncontribute to the viability or success of such\nderivative products by making them more\nappealing to funds and accounts managed by\nthird parties, and in turn lead to increased\npayments to BlackRock. Trading activity in\nsuch derivative products could also\npotentially lead to increased purchase\nactivity with respect to these iShares funds\nand increased assets under management for\nBlackRock. A Fund may, subject to applicable\nlaw, purchase investments that are the subject\nof an underwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of a Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, a Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that\nthe commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of a Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel\nand other distributors) will be entitled to\nretain fees and other amounts that they\nreceive in connection with their service to\nthe Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. A Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with a Fund's establishment of its\nbusiness relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of\n\n161\n\nprogram-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-\nspecific indemnification exposure may affect\nthe amount of securities lending activity\nBlackRock may conduct at any given point in\ntime by reducing the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain loans (including by\nasset type, collateral type and/or revenue\nprofile). BlackRock uses a predetermined\nsystematic process in order to approximate pro\nrata allocation over time. In order to\nallocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock\nas a whole must have sufficient lending\ncapacity pursuant to the various program\nlimits ( i.e ., indemnification exposure limit\nand borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending\nportfolio must hold the asset at the time a\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to\n\n162\n\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Funds. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of\norders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf\nof such Funds. In addition, transactions in\nFund shares may be executed on MEMX if third\nparty brokers select MEMX as the appropriate\nvenue for the execution of such orders.\nBlackRock has adopted policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent conflicts of interest from\ninfluencing proxy voting decisions that it\nmakes on behalf of advisory clients, including\nthe Funds, and to help ensure that such\ndecisions are made in accordance with\nBlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its\nclients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such\nproxy voting policies and procedures, actual\nproxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have\nthe effect of favoring the interests of other\nclients or businesses of other divisions or\nunits of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock\nbelieves such voting decisions to be in\naccordance with its fiduciary obligations. For\na more detailed discussion of these policies\nand procedures, see the Proxy Voting Policy\nsection of this SAI. It is also possible that,\nfrom time to time, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other funds and\nseparately managed accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s\nassets may enhance liquidity, investment\nflexibility and diversification and may\ncontribute to economies of scale that tend to\nreduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock\nreserves the right, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, to sell into the market or\nredeem in Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts.\n\n163\n\nThird parties, including service providers to\nBlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events\n(including, but not limited to, marketing and\npromotional activities and presentations,\neducational training programs and conferences)\nfor registered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors. There\nis a potential conflict of interest as such\nsponsorships may defray the costs of such\nactivities to BlackRock, and may provide an\nincentive to BlackRock to retain such third\nparties to provide services to a Fund.\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients' accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by a Fund's pricing\nvendors, especially if such valuations are\nbased on broker-dealer quotes or other data\nsources unavailable to the Fund's pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations to a Fund's pricing vendors\nand/or fund accountants, there may be\ninstances where the Fund's pricing vendors or\nfund accountants assign a different valuation\nto a security or other investment than the\nvaluation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock. As\ndisclosed in more detail in the Determination\nof Net Asset Value section in this SAI, when\nmarket quotations are not readily available or\nare believed by BFA to be unreliable, each\nFund\u2019s investments are valued at fair value by\nBFA. BFA has been designated as each Fund\u2019s\nvaluation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under\nthe Investment Company Act and acts through\nBFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c 2a-5\nCommittee \u201d ), with assistance from other BFA\npricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses. BlackRock and its\ndirectors, officers and employees, may buy and\nsell securities or other investments for their\nown accounts and may have conflicts of\ninterest with respect to investments made on\nbehalf of a Fund. As a result of differing\ntrading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for a Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that a Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\neach Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding a Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by\naccessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will not\npurchase securities or other property from, or\nsell securities or other property to, a Fund,\nexcept that a Fund may in accordance with\nrules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act\nengage in transactions with another Fund or\naccounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a\nresult of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or the Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when\n\n164\n\nBlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds\nhave retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation Units of the Funds ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Funds may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. While BlackRock uses\ngood faith estimates of the expected costs to\nthe Funds in determining the rates for fees\ncollected by the Funds related to creation and\nredemption activity, BlackRock may have\nincentives to improve Fund performance through\nthe collection of these fees. As\n\n165\n\nthese charges are based on estimates, where\nthe charges exceed actual transaction- related\ncosts and/or expenses incurred by a Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Funds may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof their investment strategy. Index based\nfunds that seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Funds may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nthey would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts. Like the Funds, the\nother portfolios or accounts for which the\nPortfolio Managers are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day portfolio management\ngenerally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its\naffiliates, as applicable, for its advisory\nservices. One or more of those other\nportfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA\nor its affiliates a performance-based fee in\nlieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee\nfor its advisory services. A portfolio or\naccount with a performance-based fee would pay\nBFA\n\n170\n\nor its affiliates a portion of that\nportfolio's or account's gains, or would pay\nBFA or its affiliates more for its services\nthan would otherwise be the case if BFA or its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and its affiliates\nhave an obligation to allocate resources and\nopportunities equitably among portfolios and\naccounts and intend to do so, shareholders of\nthe Funds should be aware that, as with any\ngroup of portfolios and accounts managed by an\ninvestment adviser and/or its affiliates\npursuant to varying fee arrangements,\nincluding performance-based fee arrangements,\nthere is the potential for a conflict of\ninterest, which may result in the Portfolio\nManagers' favoring those portfolios or\naccounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of February 29, 2024:\n                                              \n  James Mauro                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts         Managed by  Total Assets   \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Scott                                       \n  Radell*                                     \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts         Managed by   Total Assets  \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                2   $130,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     2    881,000,000  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n* Portfolio Manager iShares High Yield\nSystematic Bond ETF and iShares Investment\nGrade Systematic Bond ETF only.\n                                              \n  Jeff                                        \n  Rosenberg*                                  \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts         Managed by   Total Assets  \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                2   $130,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0            N/A  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n* Portfolio Manager for iShares High Yield\nSystematic Bond ETF and iShares Investment\nGrade Systematic Bond ETF only.\n                                              \n  Karen                                       \n  Uyehara*                                    \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts         Managed by   Total Assets  \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                2   $130,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1    636,000,000  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n* Portfolio Manager for all Funds except\niShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and\niShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF.\n\n171\n\nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of February 29, 2024\n. BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements\nwith its portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. The discretionary\nincentive income for James Mauro, Scott\nRadell, Jeff Rosenberg and Karen Uyehara\nincludes as an additional consideration the\nperformance of actively-managed portfolios\nthey manage over 1, 3 and 5 year periods\nmeasured against the respective benchmark of\neach portfolio as well as peer group\nperformance. A portion of the discretionary\nincentive compensation for James Mauro, Scott\nRadell, Jeff Rosenberg and Karen Uyehara is\ndistributed in the form of deferred cash\nawards that notionally track the returns of\nselect BlackRock, Inc. investment products\nthey manage, which provides direct alignment\nof portfolio manager discretionary incentive\ncompensation with investment product results.\nDeferred cash awards vest ratably over a\nnumber of years and, once vested, settle in\nthe form of cash.

The Distributor's principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. Shares are continuously offered for\nsale by the Funds through the Distributor or\nits agent only in Creation Units, as described\nin the applicable Prospectus and below in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts\nless than Creation Units are generally not\ndistributed by the Distributor or its agent.\nThe Distributor or its agent will arrange for\nthe delivery of the applicable Prospectus and,\nupon request, this SAI to persons purchasing\nCreation Units and will maintain records of\nboth orders placed with it or its agents and\nconfirmations of acceptance furnished by it or\nits agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a\nmember of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor\nis also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50\nU.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the\nU.S. Virgin Islands and the District of\nColumbia.

To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Funds are categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of a Fund\u2019s asset class category\n(fixed-income, domestic equity, international\nequity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be\nsubject to a different fee arrangement, is\nbased on a methodology agreed to by the Trust\nand BTC. Pursuant to the Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement: (i) fixed-income funds, such\nas the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending\nincome (which excludes collateral investment\nfees), and (ii) this amount can never be less\nthan 70% of the sum of securities lending\nincome plus collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income (which includes, for\nthis purpose, collateral investment fees)\nearned across the iShares Complex (as defined\nin the Management \u2014 Trustees and Officers\nsection of this SAI) in a calendar year\nexceeds a specified threshold, each applicable\nfixed income fund, pursuant to the current\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement, will\nreceive for the remainder of that calendar\nyear securities lending income as follows: (i)\n85% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees) and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Funds by BTC in the most\nrecent fiscal year ended February 29, 2024\nprimarily included the following:\n\n178\n\n(1) selecting borrowers from an approved list\nof borrowers and executing a securities\nlending agreement as agent on behalf of the\nFunds with each such borrower; (2) negotiating\nthe terms of securities loans, including the\namount of fees; (3) directing the delivery of\nloaned securities; (4) monitoring the daily\nvalue of the loaned securities and directing\nthe payment of additional collateral or the\nreturn of excess collateral, as necessary; (5)\ninvesting cash collateral received in\nconnection with any loaned securities; (6)\nmonitoring distributions on loaned securities\n(for example, interest and dividend activity);\n(7) in the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination. The following\ntables show the dollar amounts of income and\nfees/compensation related to the securities\nlending activities of each Fund during its\nmost recent fiscal year ended February

BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Funds, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and not from the assets of\nthe Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities\u2019\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees\n\n186\n\npaid by the Funds, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Funds and other iShares funds,\nor for other activities, such as participation\nin marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Funds, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products. Payments of the\ntype described above are sometimes referred to\nas revenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\n\n187\n\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund\n(except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury\nBond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF)\nis generally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the NYSE (normally\n4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day\nthe NYSE is open. The NAV of each of the\niShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and\niShares Short Treasury Bond ETF is generally\ncalculated twice per day: as of 12:00 p.m.,\nEastern time and as of the close of regular\ntrading hours on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern time), on each business day the NYSE\nis open. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is\nas follows: Equity Investments. Equity\nsecurities traded on a recognized securities\nexchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on separate trading\nboards of a securities exchange or through a\nmarket system that provides contemporaneous\ntransaction pricing information (each an \u201c\nExchange \u201d ) are valued using information\nobtained via independent pricing services,\ngenerally at the closing price or, if an\nExchange closing price is not available, the\nlast traded price on that Exchange prior to\nthe time as of which the assets or liabilities\nare valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by a Fund on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such security, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Fixed-Income Investments. Fixed-income\nsecurities for which market quotations are\nreadily available are generally valued using\nsuch securities\u2019 current market value. A Fund\nvalues fixed-income portfolio securities using\nthe last available bid prices or current\nmarket quotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated prices) supplied\nby a Fund\u2019s approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. The pricing services may\nuse matrix pricing or valuation models that\nutilize certain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values, including transaction data (\ne.g ., recent representative bids and offers),\ncredit quality information, perceived market\nmovements, news, and other relevant\ninformation and by other methods, which may\ninclude consideration of: yields or prices of\nsecurities of comparable quality, coupon,\nmaturity and type; indications as to values\nfrom dealers; general market conditions;\nand/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round\n\n188\n\nlot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in\nsuch securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd\nlots may trade at lower prices than\ninstitutional round lots. The amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used with respect\nto debt obligations with 60 days or less\nremaining to maturity unless such method does\nnot represent fair value. Certain fixed-income\ninvestments, including asset-backed and\nmortgage-related securities, may be valued\nbased on valuation models that consider the\nestimated cash flows of each tranche of the\nissuer, establish a benchmark yield and\ndevelop an estimated tranche-specific spread\nto the benchmark yield based on the unique\nattributes of the tranche. Options, Futures,\nSwaps and Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded\nequity options (except those that are\ncustomized) for which market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at the mean of\nthe last bid and ask prices as quoted on the\nExchange or the board of trade on which such\noptions are traded. In the event that there is\nno mean price available for an exchange traded\nequity option held by a Fund on a day on which\na Fund values such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which a Fund values such option, the\nprior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used in the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could result in a\ndifference between a Fund\u2019s performance and\nthe performance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\n\n189\n\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On\nany day the NYSE is open and a foreign market\nor the primary exchange on which a foreign\nasset or liability is traded is closed, such\nasset or liability will be valued using the\nprior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not\naware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a\nFund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair\nValue Assets is subsequently reported to the\nBoard or a committee thereof. When determining\nthe price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will\nseek to determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith US GAAP, follow the requirements for\nvaluation set forth in Financial Accounting\nStandards Board Accounting Standards\nCodification Topic 820, \u201c Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c ASC 820 \u201d\n), which defines and establishes a framework\nfor measuring fair value under US GAAP and\nexpands financial statement disclosure\nrequirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, a Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In\n\n190\n\nreturn for such services, BFA may cause a Fund\nto pay a higher commission than other brokers\nwould charge if BFA determines in good faith\nthat the commission is reasonable in relation\nto the services provided. In selecting brokers\nor dealers to execute portfolio transactions,\nBFA seeks to obtain the best price and most\nfavorable execution for a Fund and may take\ninto account a variety of factors including:\n(i) the size, nature and character of the\nsecurity or instrument being traded and the\nmarkets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii)\nthe desired timing of the transaction; (iii)\nBFA\u2019s knowledge of the expected commission\nrates and spreads currently available; (iv)\nthe activity existing and expected in the\nmarket for the particular security or\ninstrument, including any anticipated\nexecution difficulties; (v) the full range of\nbrokerage services provided; (vi) the broker\u2019s\nor dealer\u2019s capital; (vii) the quality of\nresearch and research services provided;\n(viii) the reasonableness of the commission,\ndealer spread or its equivalent for the\nspecific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s knowledge\nof any actual or apparent operational problems\nof a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be\nselected because of their ability to handle\nspecial or difficult executions, such as may\nbe involved in large block trades, thinly\ntraded securities, or other circumstances.\nSection 28(e) of the 1934 Act ( \u201c Section\n28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S. investment adviser,\nunder certain circumstances, to cause an\naccount to pay a broker or dealer a commission\nfor effecting a transaction in securities that\nexceeds the amount another broker or dealer\nwould have charged for effecting the same\ntransaction in recognition of the value of\nbrokerage and research services provided by\nthat broker or dealer. This includes\ncommissions paid on riskless principal\ntransactions in securities under certain\nconditions. From time to time, a Fund may\npurchase new issues of securities in a fixed\nprice offering. In these situations, the\nbroker may be a member of the selling group\nthat will, in addition to selling securities,\nprovide BFA with research services. FINRA has\nadopted rules expressly permitting these types\nof arrangements under certain circumstances.\nGenerally, the broker will provide research \u201c\ncredits \u201d in these situations at a rate that\nis higher than that available for typical\nsecondary market transactions. These\narrangements may not fall within the safe\nharbor of Section 28(e). OTC issues, including\nmost fixed-income securities such as corporate\ndebt and U.S. Government securities, are\nnormally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis without a\nstated commission, through dealers acting for\ntheir own account and not as brokers. The\nFunds will primarily engage in transactions\nwith these dealers or deal directly with the\nissuer unless a better price or execution\ncould be obtained by using a broker. Prices\npaid to a dealer with respect to both foreign\nand domestic securities will generally include\na \u201c spread, \u201d which is the difference between\nthe prices at which the dealer is willing to\npurchase and sell the specific security at the\ntime, and includes the dealer\u2019s normal profit.\nUnder the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a\nFund and persons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid.\n\n191\n\nInvestment decisions for the Funds and for\nother investment accounts managed by BFA and\nthe other Affiliates are made independently of\neach other in light of differing conditions. A\nvariety of factors will be considered in\nmaking investment allocations. These factors\ninclude: (i) investment objectives or\nstrategies for particular accounts, including\nsector, industry, country or region and\ncapitalization weightings; (ii) tax\nconsiderations of an account; (iii) risk or\ninvestment concentration parameters for an\naccount; (iv) supply or demand for a security\nat a given price level; (v) size of available\ninvestment; (vi) cash availability and\nliquidity requirements for accounts; (vii)\nregulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum\ninvestment size of an account; (ix) relative\nsize of account; and (x) such other factors as\nmay be approved by BlackRock\u2019s general\ncounsel. Moreover, investments may not be\nallocated to one client account over another\nbased on any of the following considerations:\n(i) to favor one client account at the expense\nof another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid\nby one client account over another or to\nproduce greater performance compensation to\nBlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a\nrelationship with a client or prospective\nclient; (iv) to compensate a client for past\nservices or benefits rendered to BlackRock or\nto induce future services or benefits to be\nrendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or\nequalize investment performance among\ndifferent client accounts. BFA and the other\nAffiliates may deal, trade and invest for\ntheir own respective accounts in the types of\nsecurities in which the Funds may invest.\nInitial public offerings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of\nsecurities may be over-subscribed and\nsubsequently trade at a premium in the\nsecondary market. When BFA is given an\nopportunity to invest in such an initial\noffering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue, the\nsupply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFunds or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified\n\n192\n\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The table below\nsets forth the brokerage commissions paid by\neach Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any\ndifferences in brokerage commissions paid by a\nFund from year to year are principally due to\nincreases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s assets\nover those periods or the magnitude of changes\nto the components of a Fund's Underlying\nIndex:\n                                              \n  Fund             Broker\u2026  Broker\u2026  Broker\u2026  \n  iShar\u2026

If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Funds and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. Certain\nFunds may use TBA transactions, which are\nexpected to cause a higher portfolio turnover\nrate and may cause significant variation in\nportfolio turnover rate because TBA positions\nare rolled every month. High turnover rates\nmay result in comparatively greater brokerage\nexpenses. While each Fund's portfolio turnover\nrates are generally expected to be low, the\nportfolio turnover rate for that portion of\nthe iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF's,\niShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's,\niShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market\nETF's, iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond\nETF's and iShares MBS ETF's assets invested\nthrough TBA transactions, if any, is expected\nto be substantially higher because TBA\npositions are rolled every month. Higher\nturnover rates would likely result in\ncomparatively greater transaction costs.

The\ndecrease in the portfolio turnover was due to\na reduction of constituent changes during\nindex rebalances and therefore a decrease in\npurchase and sales transactions of the Fund.\nAdditional Information Concerning the Trust\nShares. The Trust issues shares of beneficial\ninterests in the funds with no par value. The\nBoard may designate additional iShares funds.\nEach share issued by a fund has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of that fund. Shares\nhave no preemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the relevant fund, and\nin the net distributable assets of such fund\non liquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial\n\n198\n\nowners of 10% of the shares of a fund ( \u201c\nInsiders \u201d ) may be subject to the insider\nreporting, short-swing profit and short sale\nprovisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and\nthe SEC\u2019s rules promulgated thereunder.\nBeneficial owners and Insiders should consult\nwith their own legal counsel concerning their\nobligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the\n1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the\nSEC staff. In accordance with the Trust's\ncurrent Agreement and Declaration of Trust\n(the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the Board\nmay, without shareholder approval (unless such\nshareholder approval is required by the\nDeclaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants.\n\n199\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspect of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests, or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\nDTC may decide to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to shares of the Trust at\nany time by giving reasonable notice to the\nTrust and discharging its responsibilities\nwith respect thereto under applicable law.\nUnder such circumstances, the Trust shall take\naction to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost.\nDistribution of Shares. In connection with\neach Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded\nthrough the sale of one or more Creation Units\nby each Fund to one or more initial investors.\nInitial investors participating in the seeding\nmay be Authorized Participants, a lead market\nmaker or other third party investor or an\naffiliate of each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser.\nEach such initial investor may sell some or\nall of the shares underlying the Creation\nUnit(s) held by them pursuant to the\nregistration statement for each Fund (each, a\n\u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d ), which shares have\nbeen registered to permit the resale from time\nto time after purchase. Each Fund will not\nreceive any of the proceeds from the resale by\nthe Selling Shareholders of these shares.\nSelling Shareholders may sell shares owned by\nthem directly or through broker-dealers, in\naccordance with applicable law, on any\nnational securities exchange on which the\nshares may be listed or quoted at the time of\nsale, through trading systems, in the OTC\nmarket or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on each Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing Exchange or\nthe bond markets close earlier than normal, a\nFund may require orders to be placed earlier\nin the day.

shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of a Fund,\ngenerally consists of the Deposit Securities\nand the Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities, is designed to generate\nperformance that has a collective investment\nprofile similar to that of the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of a given Fund until such\ntime as the next-announced Fund Deposit is\nmade available. The \u201c Cash Component \u201d is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares (per Creation Unit) and the \u201c\nDeposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal to\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing a\nCreation Unit. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate\nBond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond\nMarket ETF, iShares MBS ETF, iShares National\nMuni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National\nMuni Bond ETF (the \u201c Partial Cash Funds \u201d )\ngenerally offer Creation\n\n201\n\nUnits partially for cash, but may, in certain\ncircumstances, offer Creation Units solely for\ncash or solely in-kind. The iShares California\nMuni Bond ETF and iShares New York Muni Bond\nETF generally offer Creation Units for cash,\nbut may offer Creation Units partially for\ncash or solely in-kind. Please see the Cash\nPurchase Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the Deposit\nSecurity method for further information on\npurchasing Creation Units of the Funds. The\nidentity and number or par value of the\nDeposit Securities change pursuant to changes\nin the composition of a Fund's portfolio and\nas rebalancing adjustments and corporate\naction events are reflected from time to time\nby BFA with a view to the investment objective\nof the Fund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nrelevant Underlying Index. The Trust may\nrequire the substitution of an amount of cash\n( i.e. , a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount) to replace\nany Deposit Security of the Partial Cash Funds\nthat is a TBA transaction or an interest in a\nmortgage pass-through security. The amount of\ncash contributed will be equivalent to the\nprice of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-\nthrough security interest listed as a Deposit\nSecurity. A transaction fee may be charged on\nthe cash amount contributed in lieu of the TBA\ntransaction or mortgage pass-through security.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. Fund Deposits\nmay also be modified to position a fund\ntowards a forward index rebalance to reflect\nrevisions that account for index additions,\ndeletions, and re-weights. The Trust may, in\nits sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for a Fund (Creation\nUnits of the Partial Cash Funds are generally\noffered partially for cash and all or a\nsubstantial portion of the Deposit Securities\nof iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares\nNational Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni\nBond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni\nBond ETF may be substituted for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Funds, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Funds or one of their service\nproviders that allows such member or\nparticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of Creation Units is referred\nto as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d All\nshares of the Funds, however created, will be\nentered on the records of DTC in the name of\nCede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units.\nSuch Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of such Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and on behalf of itself\nor any investor on whose behalf it will act,\nto certain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\n\n202\n\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Placement of Creation Orders. Fund\nDeposits must be delivered through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), through DTC (for corporate and\nmunicipal securities) or through a central\ndepository account, such as with Euroclear or\nDTC, maintained by State Street or JPMorgan,\nas applicable or a sub-custodian (a \u201c Central\nDepository Account \u201d ). Any portion of a Fund\nDeposit that may not be delivered through the\nFed or DTC must be delivered through a Central\nDepository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers\nmade through DTC must be ordered by the DTC\nParticipant in a timely fashion so as to\nensure the delivery of the requisite number of\nDeposit Securities through DTC to the account\nof the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund\nDeposit transfers made through the Fed must be\ndeposited by the participant institution in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number or amount of Deposit\nSecurities or cash through the Fed to the\naccount of the Fund generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.\nFund Deposit transfers made through a Central\nDepository Account must be completed pursuant\nto the requirements established by the\ncustodian or sub-custodian for such Central\nDepository Account generally before 2:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. The \u201c\nSettlement Date \u201d for all funds is generally\nthe first business day after the Transmittal\nDate. All questions as to the number of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered, and the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time\nof receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to\nState Street or JPMorgan, as applicable\nthrough the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer\nsystem in a timely manner so as to be received\nby State Street or JPMorgan, as applicable\ngenerally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities are not received by\n3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement\nDate, the creation order may be canceled. Upon\nwritten notice to the Distributor, such\ncanceled order may be resubmitted the\nfollowing Business Day using a Fund Deposit as\nnewly constituted to reflect the then current\nNAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation\nUnits so created generally will occur no later\nthan the first Business Day following the day\non which the purchase order is deemed received\nby the Distributor, provided that the relevant\nFund Deposit has been received by the Funds\nprior to such time. Purchase Orders and\nSubmission Timing. An order to purchase shares\nof a Fund will be implemented as of the NAV\nnext determined after the Authorized\nParticipant has tendered the order, as\ndescribed in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. To initiate an order for a\nCreation Unit, an Authorized Participant must\nsubmit to the Distributor or its agent an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund\nthat is in proper form (pursuant to procedures\nset forth in the Authorized Participant\nAgreement) by the Fund\u2019s submission deadline,\nknown as the \u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d Generally, an\norder must be submitted before 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on any Business Day to receive\nthat day\u2019s NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month\nTreasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury\nBond ETF, an order must be tendered before\n12:00 p.m., Eastern time to receive the 12:00\np.m. NAV and before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time to\nreceive the 4:00 p.m. NAV. There may be a\ndifferent Cutoff Time for a Fund if a creation\norder will settle on a non-standard settlement\nbasis, as described in the handbook for\nAuthorized Participants. The Distributor or\nits agent will notify BFA and the custodian of\na purchase order. The custodian will then\nprovide such information to any appropriate\nsub-custodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants and may change from time to time.\nInvestors, other than Authorized Participants,\nare responsible for making arrangements for a\ncreation request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. Those\nplacing orders to purchase Creation Units\nthrough an Authorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe purchase order to the Distributor or its\nagent by the Cutoff Time on such Business Day.\n\n203\n\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of a Fund. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Various issues, including economic or\nmarket disruptions and communications or other\noperational failures, may impede the ability\nto reach the Distributor or its agent or an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent, in their discretion, may permit the\nsubmission of such orders and requests by or\nthrough an Authorized Participant at any time\n(including on days on which the Listing\nExchange is not open for business) via\ncommunication through the facilities of the\nDistributor\u2019s or its agent\u2019s proprietary\nwebsite maintained for this purpose. Purchase\norders and redemption requests, if accepted by\nthe Trust, will be processed based on the NAV\nnext determined after such acceptance in\naccordance with a Fund\u2019s Cutoff Time as\nprovided in the Authorized Participant\nAgreement and disclosed in this SAI.\nAcceptance of Orders for Creation Units.\nSubject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once a Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. Each Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, a Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Funds, State Street or\nJPMorgan, as applicable, the sub-custodian and\nthe Distributor or its agent are under no\nduty, however, to give notification of any\ndefects or irregularities in the delivery of\nFund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the applicable Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the applicable Fund will issue\nand cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.\nCreation Units are generally issued on a \u201c T+1\nbasis \u201d ( i.e. , one Business Day after trade\ndate). Each Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a different\nbasis, including a shorter settlement period,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with the\nDistributor, each Fund will issue Creation\nUnits to such Authorized Participant,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Funds. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby a Fund or its custodian on the contractual\nsettlement date. Information concerning the\nFunds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is\n\n204\n\navailable from the Distributor or its agent.\nThe Authorized Participant Agreement will\npermit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit\nSecurities at any time and will subject the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the cost to the Funds of\npurchasing such securities and the collateral\nincluding, without limitation, liability for\nrelated brokerage, borrowings and other\ncharges. In certain cases, Authorized\nParticipants may create and redeem Creation\nUnits on the same trade date and in these\ninstances, the Funds reserve the right to\nsettle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by each\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFunds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform the ETF Services. BRIL will receive\nfrom an Authorized Participant a standard\ntransaction fee on each creation order, which\nconsists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF\nServices (the \u201c ETF Servicing Fee \u201d ) and (2)\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts charged by a Fund custodian in\nconnection with the issuance of Creation Units\nfor such creation order ( \u201c Custody\nTransaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is entitled to\nretain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the\nETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will\nreimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the\napplicable Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund\u2019s Creation Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets and settlement\nlocations associated with the issuance of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth,\nfor each Fund, an estimate of the creation\ntransaction fee for a Creation Unit based on\ndata as of June 6, 2024. The actual fee\ncharged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses for a Fund and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, a Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. For the\niShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF\nand the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, in order to offset certain\npotential market impacts related to the use of\ncustom baskets in the fixed income market and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nif a creation transaction is executed solely\nor partially in-kind, the Authorized\nParticipant may be assessed a fee, payable to\nthe Fund, which will be identical for each\nCreation Unit of the applicable Fund on the\nday of the transaction (up to the maximum\namount shown below). The fee is an estimate\nbased on historical data that is indicative of\nmarket impact. Authorized Participants will\nalso bear the costs of transferring the\nDeposit Securities to the Funds. Certain\nfees/costs associated with creation\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\neach Fund's estimated creation transaction fee\nbased on data as of June 6, 2024 and maximum\nadditional charge (as described above):\n

Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of a Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Funds will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Partial\nCash Funds generally redeem Creation Units\npartially for cash. However, the Funds reserve\nthe right to distribute securities and other\nportfolio instruments in-kind as payment for\nCreation Units being redeemed. Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Funds. Each Fund\npublishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of a\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\n\n206\n\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nFund Securities received on redemption may not\nbe identical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for a\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to replace any Fund\nSecurity of the Partial Cash Funds that is a\nTBA transaction or mortgage pass-through\nsecurity. In such cases, a transaction fee may\nbe charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of\nthe TBA transaction or mortgage pass through\nsecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities\n(except for the Partial Cash Funds, which\ngenerally redeem Creation Units partially for\ncash), and the iShares California Muni Bond\nETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares\nNew York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term\nNational Muni Bond ETF which may substitute\nall or a substantial portion of the Fund\nSecurities for cash, but each Fund reserves\nthe right to utilize a cash option for\nredemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may,\nin its sole discretion, provide such redeeming\nAuthorized Participant a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified (\ne.g., Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds\nare generally redeemed partially for cash and\nthe iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares\nNational Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni\nBond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni\nBond ETF which may substitute cash for all or\na substantial portion of the Fund Securities\nfor cash), they will be effected in\nessentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities and other instruments it\nwould otherwise receive through an in-kind\nredemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be\npaid to an in-kind redeemer. Costs Associated\nwith Redemption Transactions. A standard\nredemption transaction fee is imposed to\noffset transfer and other transaction costs\nthat may be incurred by the relevant Fund. As\ndescribed above, under an ETF Services\nAgreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an\naffiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF\nServices. BRIL will receive from an Authorized\nParticipant a standard transaction fee on each\nredemption order, which consists of (1) the\nETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction\nCosts. BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF\nServicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services\nAgreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody\nTransaction Costs to the applicable Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being redeemed, which amount\nwill vary among different Funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a Fund\u2019s Redemption\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per\n\n207\n\norder based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets, and settlement locations\nassociated with the redemption of a Creation\nUnit. The following table sets forth, for each\nFund, an estimate of the redemption\ntransaction fee for a Creation Unit based on\ndata as of June 6, 2024. The actual fee\ncharged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a redemption order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses for a Fund and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, if a redemption\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, a Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. For the\niShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF\nand the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, in order to offset certain\npotential market impacts related to the use of\ncustom baskets in the fixed income market and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nif a redemption transaction is executed solely\nor partially in-kind, the Authorized\nParticipant may be assessed a fee, payable to\nthe Fund, which will be identical for each\nCreation Unit of the applicable Fund on the\nday of the transaction (up to the maximum\namount shown below). The fee is an estimate\nbased on historical data that is indicative of\nmarket impact. Authorized Participants will\nalso bear the costs of transferring the Fund\nSecurities from a Fund to their account on\ntheir order. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith redemption transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth each Fund's estimated\nredemption transaction fee based on data as of\nJune 6, 2024 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n

Placement of\nRedemption Orders. An order to redeem shares\nof a Fund will be implemented as of the NAV\nnext determined after the Authorized\nParticipant has tendered the order, as\ndescribed in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. To initiate a redemption order,\nan Authorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto redeem shares of a Fund that is in proper\nform (pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement) by the\nCutoff Time. Generally, an order must be\nsubmitted before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nFor the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF\nand iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, an order\nmust be tendered before 12:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime to receive the 12:00 p.m. NAV and before\n4:00 p.m., Eastern time to receive the 4:00\np.m. NAV. There may be a different Cutoff Time\nfor a Fund if a redemption order will settle\non a non-standard settlement basis, as\ndescribed in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. In addition, on days when the\nListing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a\nFund may require orders to redeem Creation\nUnits to be placed earlier that day. Investors\nthat are not Authorized Participants are\nresponsible for making arrangements for a\nredemption request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. The\nAuthorized Participant must transmit the\nrequest for redemption in the form required by\nthe Funds to the Distributor or its agent in\naccordance with procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nshould be aware that their particular broker\nmay not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\nrequests to redeem Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant who has executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant on\nbehalf of itself or another redeeming investor\nwithin the time periods specified above; and\n(iii) all other procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement are properly\nfollowed. Upon receiving a redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent shall notify the\napplicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent\nof such redemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered.\n\n209\n\nDeliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund\ngenerally are made within one Business Day (\ni.e. , T+1). However, for the iShares 0-3\nMonth Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short\nTreasury Bond ETF, a redemption order that is\ntendered before 12:00 p.m., Eastern time\ngenerally will settle on a \u201c T+0 basis \u201d (\ni.e. , on trade date). Each Fund reserves the\nright to settle redemption transactions on a\ndifferent basis, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. If a Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, a Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if a Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. Delayed settlement\nmay occur due to a number of different\nreasons, including, without limitation,\nsettlement cycles for the underlying\nsecurities, unscheduled market closings, an\neffort to link distribution to dividend record\ndates and ex-dates and newly announced\nholidays. For example, the redemption\nsettlement process may be extended because of\nthe occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S.\nmarket or in the U.S. bond market that is not\na holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant's agreement with the Distributor\nor its agent, in the event an Authorized\nParticipant has submitted a redemption request\nin proper form but is unable to transfer all\nor part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to\na Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a\nFund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of such\nredemption request, the Distributor or its\nagent will accept the redemption request in\nreliance on the undertaking by the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing shares as\nsoon as possible. Such undertaking shall be\nsecured by the Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. Such collateral must be\ndelivered no later than the time specified by\na Fund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of such\nredemption request and shall be held by State\nStreet or JPMorgan, as applicable and marked-\nto-market daily. The fees of State Street or\nJPMorgan, as applicable and any sub-custodians\nin respect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Funds to\nacquire shares of the Funds at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Funds of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s)\non days that the Listing Exchange is closed or\nare otherwise not Business Days for such Fund,\nshareholders may not be able to redeem their\nshares of such Fund or purchase or sell shares\nof such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days\nwhen the NAV of such a Fund could be\nsignificantly affected by events in the\nrelevant non-U.S. markets. Under normal\ncircumstances, each of the iShares 0-3 Month\nTreasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury\nBond ETF may postpone and/or suspend\nredemption and payment beyond one business day\nonly as follows: (i) for any period during\nwhich there is a non-routine closure of the\nFedwire or applicable Federal Reserve Banks;\n(ii) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (iii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iv) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its net asset value is not\nreasonably practicable; (v) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC; (vi)\nfor any period during which the Fund, as part\nof a necessary liquidation of the Fund, has\nproperly postponed and/or suspended redemption\nof shares and payment in accordance with\nfederal securities laws; or (vii) on the\nFund\u2019s ex-dividend dates. Any such suspension\nor postponement described above will be\nconsistent with the Fund\u2019s obligations under\nSection 22(e)of the 1940 Act. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to any Fund\n(other than the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury\nBond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF):\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund will accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of\n\n210\n\ncustom baskets. Such policies and procedures\nprovide the parameters for the construction\nand acceptance of custom baskets that are in\nthe best interests of a Fund and its\nshareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for each Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific federal, state, local and non-U.S.\ntax consequences of investing in a Fund. The\nsummary is based on the laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect on the date of this SAI, all of which\nare subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\ncontinue to qualify for treatment as a\nseparate RIC under Subchapter M of the\nInternal Revenue Code. To qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually\ndistribute at least 90% of its investment\ncompany taxable income (which includes\ndividends, interest and net short-term capital\ngains) and meet several other requirements.\nAmong such other requirements are the\nfollowing: (i) at least 90% of each Fund\u2019s\nannual gross income must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock or securities or non-U.S.\ncurrencies, other income (including, but not\nlimited to, gains from options, futures or\nforward contracts) derived with respect to its\nbusiness of investing in such stock,\nsecurities or currencies, and net income\nderived from interests in qualified publicly-\ntraded partnerships ( i.e. , partnerships that\nare traded on an established securities market\nor tradable on a secondary market, other than\na partnership that derives at least 90% of its\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund\u2019s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities of any one issuer, of two or more\nissuers of which 20% or more of the voting\nstock is held by the Fund and that are engaged\nin the same or similar trades or businesses or\nrelated trades or businesses (other than the\nsecurities of other RICs) or the securities of\none or more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income. Although\nin general the passive loss rules of the\nInternal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs,\nsuch rules do apply to a RIC with respect to\nitems attributable to an interest in a\nqualified publicly-traded partnership. A\nFund\u2019s investments in\n\n211\n\npartnerships, including in qualified publicly-\ntraded partnerships, may result in the Fund\nbeing subject to state, local, or non-U.S.\nincome, franchise or withholding tax\nliabilities. Taxation of RICs. As a RIC, a\nFund will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on the portion of its taxable\ninvestment income and capital gains that it\ndistributes to its shareholders, provided that\nit satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. To satisfy the minimum\ndistribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e. , income other than\nits net realized long-term capital gain over\nits net realized short-term capital loss),\nplus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii)\n90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. A Fund will be subject to income\ntax at regular corporate rates on any taxable\nincome or gains that it does not distribute to\nits shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify\nfor any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet\nthe distribution requirement, all of its\ntaxable income will be subject to tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends-received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund\nfails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must\npay out its earnings and profits accumulated\nin that year in order to qualify again as a\nRIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e. , the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Net Capital Loss\nCarryforwards. Net capital loss carryforwards\nmay be applied against any net realized\ncapital gains in each succeeding year, until\nthey have been reduced to zero. In the event\nthat a Fund were to experience an ownership\nchange as defined under the Internal Revenue\nCode, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards as\nset forth in the table below as of February\n29, 2024, the tax year-end for the Funds\nlisted:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares 0-3 Month                 $221,144  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 1-3 Year               987,179,677  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 1-5 Year                            \n  Investment                     419,486,614  \n  GradeCorporate Bond                         \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares 3-7 Year               783,635,164  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 5-10 Year                           \n  Investment                     597,245,704  \n  GradeCorporate Bond                         \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares 7-10 Year            3,175,828,313  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 10+ Year                            \n  Investment                      85,136,614  \n  GradeCorporate Bond                         \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares 10-20 Year             938,207,745  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 20+ Year             5,817,636,963  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n  iShares 25+ Year                            \n  Treasury STRIPS                 68,022,849  \n  BondETF                                     \n  iShares Agency Bond             24,421,586  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares BBB Rated                  967,836  \n  Corporate Bond ETF                          \n  iShares Broad USD                           \n  Investment                     133,995,749  \n  GradeCorporate Bond                         \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares California              22,434,768  \n  Muni Bond ETF                               \n  iShares Core 5-10                6,188,677  \n  Year USD Bond ETF                           \n                                              \n212\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares Core 10+                12,719,513  \n  Year USD Bond ETF                           \n  iShares Core U.S.            1,591,095,355  \n  Aggregate Bond ETF                          \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Advanced                                    \n  InvestmentGrade                  1,229,795  \n  Corporate                                   \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Advanced Total USD              28,347,698  \n  BondMarket ETF                              \n  iShares ESG Aware                           \n  1-5 Year                        26,221,063  \n  USDCorporate Bond                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG Aware                           \n  U.S. Aggregate                  61,858,536  \n  BondETF                                     \n  iShares ESG Aware                           \n  USD Corporate                   38,466,047  \n  BondETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Government/Credit                5,025,016  \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  iShares High Yield              16,666,884  \n  Systematic Bond ETF                         \n  iShares iBoxx $                             \n  High Yield                   1,889,354,790  \n  CorporateBond ETF                           \n  iShares iBoxx $                             \n  Investment                   1,721,281,747  \n  GradeCorporate Bond                         \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  IntermediateGovern\u2026             33,218,302  \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  iShares Investment                          \n  Grade                           20,183,666  \n  SystematicBond ETF                          \n  iShares MBS ETF                584,170,780  \n  iShares National               374,742,492  \n  Muni Bond ETF                               \n  iShares New York                 7,332,102  \n  Muni Bond ETF                               \n  iShares Short-Term                          \n  National Muni                   42,321,909  \n  BondETF                                     \n  iShares Short                   48,260,472  \n  Treasury Bond ETF                           \n                                              \nExcise Tax. A Fund will be subject to a 4%\nexcise tax on certain undistributed income if\nit does not distribute to its shareholders in\neach calendar year at least 98% of its\nordinary income for the calendar year plus at\nleast 98.2% of its capital gain net income for\nthe 12 months ended October 31 of such year.\nFor this purpose, however, any ordinary income\nor capital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or capital gain distribution declared\nby a Fund in October, November or December of\nany calendar year and payable to shareholders\nof record on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its net tax-\nexempt income, investment company taxable\nincome and any net realized long-term capital\ngains in excess of net realized short-term\ncapital losses (including any capital loss\ncarryovers). However, if a Fund retains for\ninvestment an amount equal to all or a portion\nof its net long-term capital gains in excess\nof its net short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers), it\nwill be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat\nrate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that\nevent, the Fund will report such retained\namounts as undistributed capital gains in a\nnotice to its shareholders who (a) will be\nrequired to include in income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, as long-term capital\ngains, their proportionate shares of the\nundistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to\ncredit\n\n213\n\ntheir proportionate shares of the tax paid by\nthe Fund on the undistributed amount against\ntheir U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if\nany, and to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gain dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income.\nLong-term capital gains are eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for\nnon-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts. If an individual receives a regular\ndividend qualifying for the long-term capital\ngain rates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of a Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of a\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. The Fund's capital loss carryovers,\nif any, carried from taxable years beginning\nbefore 2011 do not reduce current earnings and\nprofits, even if such carryforwards offset\ncurrent year realized gains. Shareholders\nreceiving dividends or distributions in the\nform of additional shares should be treated\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes as\nreceiving a distribution in an amount equal to\nthe amount of money that the shareholders\nreceiving cash dividends or distributions will\nreceive and should have a cost basis in the\nshares received equal to such amount. No\ndeduction would be allowed to an investor for\ninterest on indebtedness incurred or continued\nto purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the\nextent the interest deduction would relate to\nexempt-interest dividends received. A 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on net investment income, including,\nbut not limited to, interest, dividends, and\nnet gain from investments, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly), and of estates\nand trusts. Investors considering buying\nshares just prior to a dividend or capital\ngain distribution should be aware that,\nalthough the price of shares purchased at that\ntime may reflect the amount of the forthcoming\ndistribution, such dividend or distribution\nmay nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund\nis the holder of record of any security on the\nrecord date for any dividends payable with\nrespect to such security, such dividends will\nbe included in the Fund\u2019s gross income not as\nof the date received but as of the later of\n(i) the date such security became ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividends ( i.e ., the\ndate on which a buyer of the security would\nnot be entitled to receive the declared, but\nunpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund\nacquired such security. Accordingly, in order\nto satisfy its income distribution\nrequirements, a Fund may be required to pay\ndividends based on anticipated earnings, and\nshareholders may receive dividends in an\nearlier year than would otherwise be the case.\nIn certain situations, a Fund may, for a\ntaxable year, defer all or a portion of its\nnet capital loss (or if there is no net\ncapital loss, then any net long-term or short-\nterm capital loss) realized after October and\nits late-year ordinary loss (defined as the\nsum of the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains, plus the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions.\n\n214\n\nSales of Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of\nshares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by a Fund will be treated\nas a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss\nwill be treated as capital gain or loss if the\nshares are capital assets in the shareholder\u2019s\nhands and will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if the shares are held for more than one\nyear and short-term capital gain or loss if\nthe shares are held for one year or less. Any\nloss realized on a sale or exchange will be\ndisallowed to the extent the shares disposed\nof are replaced, including replacement through\nthe reinvesting of dividends or capital gains\ndistributions, or by an option, or contract to\nacquire substantially identical shares, within\na 61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents a shareholder from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting his or her investment within a family\nof mutual funds. Backup Withholding. In\ncertain cases, a Fund will be required to\nwithhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S.\nTreasury such amounts withheld from any\ndistributions paid to a shareholder who: (i)\nhas failed to provide a correct taxpayer\nidentification number; (ii) is subject to\nbackup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has\nfailed to certify to a Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding; or (iv) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and any amount withheld\nmay be credited against a shareholder's U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. Sections 351 and\n362. The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has\nthe right to reject an order for a purchase of\nshares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nshares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of a given Fund and if,\npursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If a Fund\u2019s basis in such securities\non the date of deposit was less than market\nvalue on such date, the Fund, upon disposition\nof the securities, would recognize more\ntaxable gain or less taxable loss than if its\nbasis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to a Fund or\nits shareholders. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. Tax-Exempt Interest Income.\nDividends paid by the Municipal Bond Funds\nthat are properly reported as exempt-interest\ndividends will not be subject to regular\nfederal income tax. Each Municipal Bond Fund\nintends to invest its assets in a manner such\nthat dividend distributions to its\nshareholders will generally be exempt from\nU.S. federal income taxation. Dividends paid\nby the Fund will be exempt from federal income\ntax (though not necessarily exempt from state\nand local taxation) to the extent of the\nFund\u2019s tax-exempt interest income as long as\n50% or more of the value of the Fund\u2019s assets\nat the end of each quarter is invested in\nstate, municipal and other bonds that are\nexcluded from gross income for federal income\ntax purposes and as long as the Fund properly\nreports such dividends as exempt-interest\ndividends. So long as, at the close of each\nquarter of the taxable year of the California\nFund, at least 50% of the value of the\nCalifornia Fund\u2019s total assets consists of\nobligations of the U.S. and of the State of\nCalifornia and its political subdivisions, the\ninterest on which is exempt from California\npersonal income tax and California corporate\nincome tax ( \u201c CA-exempt Obligations \u201d ),\nexempt-interest dividends (i) paid by the\nCalifornia Fund in an amount not exceeding the\ninterest received on such CA-exempt\nObligations during the California Fund\u2019s\ntaxable year, and (ii) reported by the\nCalifornia Fund as exempt-interest dividends\n(in a written notice mailed to the California\nFund\u2019s shareholders) will be treated as an\nitem of interest excludable from income for\nCalifornia personal income tax purposes and\ncorporate income tax purposes. Exempt-interest\ndividends paid to a corporate shareholder\nsubject to California corporate franchise tax,\nhowever, will be taxable as ordinary income\nfor purposes of such tax. Distributions\nderived from interest on tax-exempt\nobligations issued by governmental authorities\nin\n\n215\n\nstates other than California or on other\nobligations or investments the interest on\nwhich is not exempt from California personal\nincome tax or corporate income tax, and\ndistributions to shareholders derived from\nshort-term or long-term capital gains, will be\ntaxed as ordinary income for California\npersonal and corporate income tax purposes and\nCalifornia corporate franchise tax purposes.\nInterest on indebtedness incurred or continued\nby a shareholder of the California Fund to\npurchase or carry shares of the California\nFund generally will not be deductible for\nCalifornia personal or corporate income tax\npurposes. It should be noted that California\nlaw deviates from the provisions of Subchapter\nM of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal\nRevenue Code, relating to regulated investment\ncompanies in certain potentially material\nrespects. The foregoing is a general,\nabbreviated summary of certain of the\nprovisions of California law presently in\neffect that govern the taxation of the\nshareholders of the California Fund. These\nprovisions are subject to change by\nlegislative or administrative action, and any\nsuch change may be retroactive. Shareholders\nare advised to consult with their own tax\nadvisors for more detailed information\nconcerning California tax matters. Individual\nshareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond\nETF will not be required to include in their\ngross income for New York State and City\npurposes any portion of distributions received\nfrom the Fund that are directly attributable\nto (i) interest earned on tax-exempt\nobligations issued by New York State or any\npolitical subdivision thereof (including New\nYork City) or (ii) interest earned on\nobligations of U.S. possessions or territories\nthat is exempt from state taxation pursuant to\nfederal law, provided that the Fund qualifies\nas a RIC and satisfies the requirement that at\nleast 50% of its assets at the close of each\nquarter of its taxable year constitute such\nobligations. Distributions from the Fund that\nare attributable to sources other than those\ndescribed in the preceding sentence (including\ninterest on obligations of other states and\ntheir political subdivisions) will generally\nbe taxable to individual shareholders as\nordinary income. Shareholders of the iShares\nNew York Muni Bond ETF that are subject to New\nYork State corporation franchise tax or New\nYork City general corporation tax will be\nrequired to include exempt-interest dividends\npaid by the Fund in their \u201c entire net income\n\u201d for purposes of such taxes and will be\nrequired to include their shares of the Fund\nin their investment capital for purposes of\nsuch taxes. If a shareholder is subject to\nunincorporated business taxation by New York\nCity, income and gains distributed by the Fund\nwill be subject to such taxation except to the\nextent such distributions are directly\nattributable to interest earned on tax-exempt\nobligations issued by New York State or any\npolitical subdivision thereof (including New\nYork City). However, shareholders of the Fund\nwill not be subject to the unincorporated\nbusiness tax imposed by New York City solely\nby reason of their ownership of shares in the\nFund. Shares of the iShares New York Muni Bond\nETF will not be subject to property taxes\nimposed by New York State or City. Interest on\nindebtedness incurred by shareholders to\npurchase or carry shares of New York Municipal\nIncome generally will not be deductible for\nNew York State personal income tax purposes.\nInterest income on the Fund that is\ndistributed to its shareholders will generally\nnot be taxable to the Fund for purposes of New\nYork State corporation franchise tax or New\nYork City general corporation tax. The\nforegoing is a general, abbreviated summary of\ncertain of the provisions of the tax laws of\nNew York State and City presently in effect as\nthey directly govern the taxation of\nshareholders of the Fund. These provisions are\nsubject to change by legislative or\nadministrative action, and any such change may\nbe retroactive with respect to New York\nMunicipal Income transactions. Shareholders\nare advised to consult with their own tax\nadvisers for more detailed information\nconcerning New York State and City matters.\nTaxation of Certain Derivatives. A Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of the Fund as a RIC.\n\n216\n\nA Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c section\n1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All section 1256\ncontracts held by the Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). The cost of any\npayments made by the Fund on a swap\ntransaction will be netted pro rata against\nboth tax exempt and taxable gross income. With\nrespect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may\nbe required to currently recognize income or\nloss with respect to future payments on such\nswaps or may elect under certain circumstances\nto mark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Periodic\nnet payments that would otherwise constitute\nordinary deductions but are allocable under\nthe Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest\ndividends will not be allowed as deductions\nbut instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.\nMarket Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a bond, including a tax-exempt\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount ( \u201c OID \u201d ). To the\nextent a Fund does not include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Non-U.S. Investments. Income\n(including, in some cases, capital gains)\nreceived by certain of the Funds from\ninvestments in non-U.S. securities may be\nsubject to withholding and other taxes imposed\nby non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between\ncertain countries and the U.S. may reduce or\neliminate such taxes in some cases. If more\nthan 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets at the close\nof its taxable year consists of securities of\nnon-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for\nU.S. income tax purposes to treat non-U.S.\nincome taxes paid by it as paid by its\nshareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make\nthis election in some, but not necessarily\nall, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to\nmake an election, shareholders of the Fund\nwould be required to take into account an\namount equal to their pro rata portions of\nsuch non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable\nincome and then treat an amount equal to those\nnon-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax\ndeduction or as a foreign tax credit against\ntheir U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after\nany year for which it makes such an election,\na Fund will report to its shareholders the\namount per share of such non-U.S. income tax\nthat must be included in each shareholder\u2019s\ngross income and the amount which will be\navailable for the deduction or credit. No\ndeduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by\na shareholder who does not itemize deductions.\nCertain limitations will be imposed on the\nextent to which the credit (but not the\ndeduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed.\nUnder Section 988 of the Internal Revenue\nCode, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime a Fund accrues income or receivables or\nexpenses or other liabilities denominated in a\nnon-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually\ncollects such income or pays such liabilities\nare generally treated as ordinary income or\nordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)\nrealized on debt instruments will be treated\nas Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent\nattributable to changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the currencies in\nwhich the instruments are denominated.\nSimilarly, gain or losses on non-U.S.\ncurrency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts,\ncertain non-U.S. currency options or futures\ncontracts and the disposition of debt\nsecurities denominated in non-U.S. currency,\nto the extent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless the Fund were\nto elect otherwise. Original Issue Discount.\nOID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the\nterm of the bond and is tax-exempt to the\nholder of the bond. STRIPS are treated as\nnewly issued debt instruments having OID.\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to\ninflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated\ninterest on such bonds is taken into income by\na Fund under its regular method of accounting\nfor interest income. The amount of a positive\ninflation adjustment, which results in an\nincrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, is treated as OID. The OID\nis included in a Fund\u2019s gross income ratably\nduring the\n\n217\n\nperiod ending with the maturity of the bond,\nunder the general OID inclusion rules. The\namount of a Fund\u2019s OID in a taxable year with\nrespect to a bond will increase a Fund\u2019s\ntaxable income for such year without a\ncorresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, a Fund may need to use\nother sources of cash to satisfy its\ndistributions for such year. The amount of\nnegative inflation adjustment, which results\nin a decrease in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, reduces the\namount of interest (including stated,\ninterest, OID, and market discount, if any)\notherwise includible in a Fund\u2019s income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year.\nReporting. If a shareholder recognizes a loss\nwith respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million\nor more for an individual shareholder or $10\nmillion or more for a corporate shareholder,\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases exempted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The\nfact that a loss is reportable under these\nregulations does not affect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, a Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or\npartner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of a\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over a\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, a Fund may report all, some or\nnone of its potentially eligible dividends as\nsuch qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of\n\n218\n\ncertain U.S. real property interests.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisors concerning the particular tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in the\nFund. A foreign shareholder also may be\nsubject to certain \u201c wash sale \u201d rules to\nprevent the avoidance of the tax filing and\npayment obligations discussed above through\nthe sale and repurchase of Fund shares.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisors concerning the particular tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in a\nFund. Separately, a 30% withholding tax is\ncurrently imposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items paid to: (i)\nforeign financial institutions, including\nnon-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree\nto collect and disclose to the IRS information\nregarding their direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation including the names, addresses and\ntaxpayer identification numbers of direct and\nindirect U.S. account holders; comply with due\ndiligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information as to\ntheir account holders, or (ii) in the event\nthat an applicable intergovernmental agreement\nand implementing legislation are adopted,\nprovide local revenue authorities with similar\naccount holder information. Other foreign\nentities will need to provide the name,\naddress and taxpayer identification number of\neach substantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership, unless certain exceptions apply.\nShares of a Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations only and is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. Purchasers of shares should consult\ntheir own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such shares,\nincluding consequences under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing\ndiscussion is based on applicable provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,\njudicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date of this\nSAI. Changes in applicable authority could\nmaterially affect the conclusions discussed\nabove, and such changes often occur.

The\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\n( \u201c AIFMD \u201d ) imposes detailed and\nprescriptive obligations on fund managers\nestablished in the EU ( \u201c EU Operative\nProvisions \u201d ). These do not currently apply\nto managers established outside of the EU,\nsuch as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only\nrequired to comply with certain disclosure,\nreporting and transparency obligations of\nAIFMD ( \u201c AIFMD Disclosure Provisions \u201d ) if\nsuch managers market a fund to EU investors.\nWhere the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate\nto EU Operative Provisions that do not apply\nto BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made.\nThese EU Operative Provisions include\nprescriptive rules on: measuring and capping\nleverage in line with known European\nstandards; the treatment of investors; the use\nof \u201c depositaries \u201d ; and coverage for\nprofessional liability risks. AIFMD imposes\ncertain conditions on the marketing of funds,\nsuch as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD\nrequires that an \u2018alternative investment fund\nmanager\u2019 ( \u201c AIFM \u201d ) be identified to meet\nsuch conditions where such marketing is\nsought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal\nentity responsible for performing the\nportfolio and risk management of the Funds,\nshall be the AIFM. AIFMD requires disclosure\non an ongoing basis of certain information\nrelating to the use of special arrangements,\nleverage, rights of reuse of collateral,\nguarantees granted under leverage arrangements\nand the use of gates, side pockets and similar\nliquidity management tools. Given that the\nFunds do not use any special arrangements or\nallow for collateral reuse, it is not intended\nthat such disclosures will need to be made by\nthe Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the\nextent relevant and appropriate, disclose in\nits annual report information on the Fund's\nleverage, risk profile and risk management\nsystems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also\ndisclose material changes, if any, to the\nliquidity management systems and procedures\nemployed in respect of the Fund. BFA has\nregistered the following Funds for marketing\nto investors in the Netherlands and the U.K.:\niShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF\niShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF BFA has registered the iShares 7-10\nYear Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 20+ Year\nTreasury Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate\nBond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF and iShares iBoxx $ High\nYield Corporate Bond ETF for marketing to\ninvestors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden\nand the U.K. Investors\u2019 Rights. Each Fund\nrelies on the services of BFA and its other\nservice providers, including the Distributor,\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent.\nFurther information about the duties and roles\nof these service providers is set out in this\nSAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund\nare not parties to the relevant agreement with\nthese service providers and do not have\nexpress contractual rights against the Fund or\nits service providers, except certain\ninstitutional investors that are Authorized\nParticipants may have certain express\ncontractual rights with respect to the\nDistributor under the terms of the relevant\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nmay have certain legal rights under federal or\nstate law against a Fund or its service\nproviders. In the event that an investor\nconsiders that it may have a claim against a\nFund, or against any service provider in\nconnection with its investment in a Fund, such\ninvestor should consult its own legal advisor.\n\n220\n\nBy contract, Authorized Participants\nirrevocably submit to the non-exclusive\njurisdiction of any New York State or U.S.\nfederal court sitting in New York City over\nany suit, action or proceeding arising out of\nor relating to the Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Jurisdiction over other claims,\nwhether by investors or Authorized\nParticipants, will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case and the law of the\njurisdiction in which the proceeding is\nbrought.\n\n221\n\nAppendix A - iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies Open-End Fund Proxy Voting Policy\nProcedures Governing Delegation of Proxy\nVoting to Fund Advisers Effective Date: August\n1, 2021 Last Review Date: August 25, 2023\nOpen-End Mutual Funds (including money market\nfunds) Exchange-Traded Funds Objective and\nScope Set forth below is the Open-End Fund\nProxy Voting Policy. Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nAppendix B \u2013 Description of Fixed-Income\nRatings A rating is generally assigned to a\nfixed-income security at the time of issuance\nby a credit rating agency designated as a\nNRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time\nto time revise such ratings, they undertake no\nobligation to do so, and the ratings given to\nsecurities at issuance do not necessarily\nrepresent ratings which would be given to\nthese securities on a particular subsequent\ndate. NRSROs may rate specific investments (\ne.g. , bonds), issuers ( e.g. , corporations,\ngovernments and financial institutions) and/or\nprograms ( e.g. , commercial paper programs).\nHowever, certain types of investments may not\nbe rated by NRSROs, such as certain\ngovernment/sovereign obligations, US agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, time deposits at\nfinancial institutions, and derivative\ninstruments such as credit default swaps. For\nthese types of investments, as well as US\nTreasury securities (some of which are not\nrated), where a NRSRO has not rated the\nspecific investment but has rated the\ninvestment\u2019s issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, BFA\nmay consider the investment to have the same\nNRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, as\napplicable. In the case of municipal\nsecurities, where one NRSRO provides multiple\nratings for the same security ( e.g. , \u201c\nunderlying, \u201d \u201c insured \u201d and/or \u201c enhanced \u201d\nratings), BFA may consider the security to\nhave the highest of the multiple ratings. New\nissue securities (regardless of type) may not\nbe rated by a NRSRO at the time of their\ninitial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or\nterm sheets for new issue securities may\ninclude an expected rating for the security\n(as determined by the underwriter and/or\nissuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of\nthe security. If applicable, when deciding\nwhether to purchase a new issue security that\nhas not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may\nattribute an expected rating to the security\nbased on: (i) the expected rating of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security;\n(ii) the NRSRO\u2019s rating for the issuer of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security; or\n(iii) with respect to asset-backed securities,\nthe rating of a prior issuance having a\nsimilar structure or the same sponsor. Where\nthe investment objective of a Fund is to track\nthe performance of an index that includes\ncredit ratings eligibility criteria as part of\nits index methodology, a Fund may purchase any\nsecurity within the index, such security\nhaving been determined by the index provider\nas meeting its credit ratings eligibility\ncriteria. The credit ratings practices of an\nindex provider may differ from BlackRock\u2019s\npractices, as described above. Further, a Fund\nmay invest, directly or indirectly, in\nsecurities that are not rated by a rating\nagency or securities with a credit rating that\ndiffers from the credit rating specified in\nits index methodology in various\ncircumstances, including where a security is\ndowngraded but not yet removed from an index,\nfollowing the removal of a security from an\nindex prior to its sale by the Fund or as a\nresult of a corporate action or restructuring\naffecting an issuer of a security held by a\nFund. Fixed-income securities which are\nunrated may expose the investor to risks with\nrespect to capacity to pay interest or repay\nprincipal which are similar to the risks of\nlower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of\nthese securities is dependent on the\ninvestment adviser\u2019s judgment, analysis and\nexperience in the evaluation of such\nsecurities. Investors should note that the\nassignment of a rating to a security by an\nNRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent\ndevelopments on the issuer\u2019s ability to make\ninterest and principal payments or on the\nlikelihood of default. Securities deemed to be\nhigh yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.\nThe descriptions below relate to general long-\nterm and short-term obligations of an issuer.\nMoody\u2019s Ratings Long-Term Obligations Aaa:\nObligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the\nhighest quality, subject to the lowest level\nof credit risk. Aa: Obligations rated Aa are\njudged to be of high quality and are subject\nto very low credit risk. A: Obligations rated\nA are judged to be upper-medium grade and are\nsubject to low credit risk. Baa: Obligations\nrated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and\nsubject to moderate credit risk and as such\nmay possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics.\n\nB-1\n\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be\nspeculative and are subject to substantial\ncredit risk. B: Obligations rated B are\nconsidered speculative and are subject to high\ncredit risk. Caa: Obligations rated Caa are\njudged to be speculative, of poor standing and\nare subject to very high credit risk. Ca:\nObligations rated Ca are highly speculative\nand are likely in, or very near, default, with\nsome prospect of recovery of principal and\ninterest. C: Obligations rated C are the\nlowest rated and are typically in default,\nwith little prospect for recovery of principal\nor interest. Note: Moody's appends numerical\nmodifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating\nclassification from Aa through Caa. The\nmodifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks\nin the higher end of its generic rating\ncategory; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range\nranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a\nranking in the lower end of that generic\nrating category. Absence of Rating: Where no\nrating has been assigned or where a rating has\nbeen withdrawn, it may be for reasons\nunrelated to the creditworthiness of the\nissue. Should no rating be assigned, the\nreason may be one of the following: 1. An\napplication was not received or accepted. 2.\nThe issue or issuer belongs to a group of\nsecurities or entities that are not rated as a\nmatter of policy. 3. There is a lack of\nessential data pertaining to the issue or\nissuer. 4. The issue was privately placed, in\nwhich case the rating is not published in\nMoody\u2019s publications. Withdrawal may occur if\nnew and material circumstances arise, the\neffects of which preclude satisfactory\nanalysis; if there is no longer available\nreasonable up-to-date data to permit a\njudgment to be formed; if a bond is called for\nredemption; or for other reasons. Short-Term\nObligations Moody\u2019s short-term debt ratings\nare opinions of the ability of issuers to\nhonor short-term financial obligations,\ngenerally with an original maturity not\nexceeding thirteen months. Moody's employs the\nfollowing designations to indicate the\nrelative repayment ability of rated issuers:\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions)\nrated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay\nshort-term debt obligations. P-2: Issuers (or\nsupporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a\nstrong ability to repay short-term debt\nobligations. P-3: Issuers (or supporting\ninstitutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable\nability to repay short-term obligations. NP:\nIssuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not\nPrime do not fall within any of the Prime\nrating categories. US Municipal Short-Term\nDebt Obligations There are three rating\ncategories for short-term municipal\nobligations that are considered investment-\ngrade and are designated as Municipal\nInvestment Grade (MIG). In addition, those\nshort-term obligations that are of speculative\nquality are designated SG, or speculative\ngrade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of\nthe obligation. MIG 1: This designation\ndenotes superior credit quality. Excellent\nprotection is afforded by established cash\nflows, highly reliable liquidity support, or\ndemonstrated broad-based access to the market\nfor refinancing. MIG 2: This designation\ndenotes strong credit quality. Margins of\nprotection are ample, although not as large as\nin the preceding group. MIG 3: This\ndesignation denotes acceptable credit quality.\nLiquidity and cash-flow protection may be\nnarrow, and market access for refinancing is\nlikely to be less well-established.\n\nB-2\n\nSG: This designation denotes speculative-grade\ncredit quality. Debt instruments in this\ncategory may lack sufficient margins of\nprotection. S&P Global Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: An obligation rated AAA has\nthe highest rating assigned by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nextremely strong. AA: An obligation rated AA\ndiffers from the highest-rated obligations\nonly to a small degree. The obligor\u2019s capacity\nto meet its financial commitment is very\nstrong. A: An obligation rated A is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher-rated\ncategories. However, the obligor\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is still strong. BBB: An obligation\nrated BBB exhibits adequate protection\nparameters. However, adverse economic\nconditions or changing circumstances are more\nlikely to lead to a weakened capacity of the\nobligor to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation. BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:\nObligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are\nregarded as having significant speculative\ncharacteristics. BB indicates the least degree\nof speculation and C the highest. While such\nobligations will likely have some quality and\nprotective characteristics, these may be\noutweighed by large uncertainties or major\nexposures to adverse conditions. BB: An\nobligation rated BB is less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues.\nHowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nor exposure to adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions which could lead to the\nobligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. B: An\nobligation rated B is more vulnerable to\nnonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the\nobligor currently has the capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation.\nAdverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions will likely impair the obligor\u2019s\ncapacity or willingness to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. CCC: An\nobligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable\nto nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable\nbusiness, financial, and economic conditions\nfor the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. In the event of\nadverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions, the obligor is not likely to have\nthe capacity to meet its financial commitment\non the obligation. CC: An obligation rated CC\nis currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.\nThe CC rating is used when a default has not\nyet occurred, but S&P Global Ratings expects\ndefault to be a virtual certainty, regardless\nof the anticipated time to default. C: An\nobligation rated C is currently highly\nvulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation\nis expected to have lower relative seniority\nor lower ultimate recovery compared to\nobligations that are rated higher. D: An\nobligation rated D is in default or in breach\nof an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital\ninstruments, the D rating category is used\nwhen payments on an obligation are not made on\nthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings\nbelieves that such payments will be made\nwithin five business days in the absence of a\nstated grace period or within the earlier of\nthe stated grace period or 30 calendar days.\nThe D rating also will be used upon the filing\nof a bankruptcy petition or the taking of\nsimilar action and where default on an\nobligation is a virtual certainty, for example\ndue to automatic stay provisions. An\nobligation's rating is lowered to D if it is\nsubject to a distressed exchange offer. NR: NR\nindicates no rating has been requested, or\nthat there is insufficient information on\nwhich to base a rating, or that S&P Global\nRatings does not rate a particular obligation\nas a matter of policy. Note: The ratings from\nAA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a\nplus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative\nstanding within the major rating categories.\nShort-Term Obligations\n\nB-3\n\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is\nrated in the highest category by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor's capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nstrong. Within this category, certain\nobligations are designated with a plus sign\n(+). This indicates that the obligor's\ncapacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthese obligations is extremely strong. A-2: A\nshort-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rating\ncategories. However, the obligor's capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is satisfactory. A-3: A short-term\nobligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters. However, adverse\neconomic conditions or changing circumstances\nare more likely to lead to a weakened capacity\nof the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. B: A short-term\nobligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable\nand has significant speculative\ncharacteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments;\nhowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nwhich could lead to the obligor's inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments. C:\nA short-term obligation rated C is currently\nvulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon\nfavorable business, financial, and economic\nconditions for the obligor to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. D: A\nshort-term obligation rated D is in default or\nin breach of an imputed promise. For non-\nhybrid capital instruments, the D rating\ncategory is used when payments on an\nobligation are not made on the date due,\nunless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace\nperiod. However, any stated grace period\nlonger than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The D rating also will\nbe used upon the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual\ncertainty, for example due to automatic stay\nprovisions. An obligation's rating is lowered\nto D if it is subject to a distressed exchange\noffer. Municipal Short-Term Obligations An S&P\nU.S. municipal note rating reflects S&P Global\nRatings opinion about the liquidity factors\nand market access risks unique to the notes.\nNotes due in three years or less will likely\nreceive a note rating. Notes with an original\nmaturity of more than three years will most\nlikely receive a long-term debt rating. SP-1:\nStrong capacity to pay principal and interest.\nAn issue determined to possess a very strong\ncapacity to pay debt service is given a plus\n(+) designation. SP-2: Satisfactory capacity\nto pay principal and interest, with some\nvulnerability to adverse financial and\neconomic changes over the term of the notes.\nSP-3: Speculative capacity to pay principal\nand interest. Fitch Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA\nratings denote the lowest expectation of\ncredit risk. They are assigned only in cases\nof exceptionally strong capacity for payment\nof financial commitments. This capacity is\nhighly unlikely to be adversely affected by\nforeseeable events. AA: Very high credit\nquality. AA ratings denote expectations of\nvery low credit risk. They indicate very\nstrong capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable\nevents. A: High credit quality. A ratings\ndenote expectations of low credit risk. The\ncapacity for payment of financial commitments\nis considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions than is the\ncase for higher ratings. BBB: Good credit\nquality. BBB ratings indicate that\nexpectations of credit risk are currently low.\nThe capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments is considered adequate but adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions are more\nlikely to impair this capacity.\n\nB-4\n\nBB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk,\nparticularly in the event of adverse changes\nin business or economic conditions over time;\nhowever, business or financial alternatives\nmay be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly speculative.\nB ratings indicate that material credit risk\nis present. CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC\nratings indicate that substantial credit risk\nis present. CC: Very high levels of credit\nrisk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of\ncredit risk. C: Exceptionally high levels of\ncredit risk. C indicates exceptionally high\nlevels of credit risk. Defaulted obligations\ntypically are not assigned RD or D ratings,\nbut are instead rated in the B to C rating\ncategories, depending upon their recovery\nprospects and other relevant characteristics.\nThis approach better aligns obligations that\nhave comparable overall expected loss but\nvarying vulnerability to default and loss.\nNote: The modifiers \u201c + \u201d or \u201c - \u201d may be\nappended to a rating to denote relative status\nwithin major rating categories. Such suffixes\nare not added to the AAA obligation rating\ncategory, or to corporate finance obligation\nratings in the categories below CCC. The\nsubscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to\ndenote embedded market risk which is beyond\nthe scope of the rating. The designation is\nintended to make clear that the rating solely\naddresses the counterparty risk of the issuing\nbank. It is not meant to indicate any\nlimitation in the analysis of the counterparty\nrisk, which in all other respects follows\npublished Fitch criteria for analyzing the\nissuing financial institution. Fitch does not\nrate these instruments where the principal is\nto any degree subject to market risk. Short-\nTerm Obligations (Corporate and Public\nFinance) A short-term issuer or obligation\nrating is based in all cases on the short-term\nvulnerability to default of the rated entity\nor security stream and relates to the capacity\nto meet financial obligations in accordance\nwith the documentation governing the relevant\nobligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to\nobligations whose initial maturity is viewed\nas \u201c short-term \u201d based on market convention.\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for\ncorporate, sovereign, and structured\nobligations, and up to 36 months for\nobligations in U.S. public finance markets.\nF1: Highest short-term credit quality.\nIndicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for\ntimely payment of financial commitments; may\nhave an added \u201c + \u201d to denote any\nexceptionally strong credit feature. F2: Good\nshort-term credit quality. Good intrinsic\ncapacity for timely payment of financial\ncommitments. F3: Fair short-term credit\nquality. The intrinsic capacity for timely\npayment of financial commitments is adequate.\nB: Speculative short-term credit quality.\nMinimal capacity for timely payment of\nfinancial commitments, plus heightened\nvulnerability to near term adverse changes in\nfinancial and economic conditions. C: High\nshort-term default risk. Default is a real\npossibility. RD: Restricted default. Indicates\nan entity that has defaulted on one or more of\nits financial commitments, although it\ncontinues to meet other financial obligations.\nTypically applicable to entity ratings only.\nD: Default. Indicates a broad-based default\nevent for an entity, or the default of a\nshort-term obligation. IS-SAI-02-1224\n\nB-5\n"
