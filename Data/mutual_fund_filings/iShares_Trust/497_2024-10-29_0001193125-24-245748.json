Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined in the Portfolio\nHolding Information section of this SAI)\nmaintain with the Trust collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of any Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks of the Fund The Fund\nallocates and reallocates its assets among a\ncombination of Underlying Funds in proportions\nbased on its own comprehensive investment\nstrategy. The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n( \u201c ETF \u201d ) and does not seek to replicate the\nperformance of a specified index and may have\na higher degree of portfolio turnover than\nsuch index funds. The Fund is one of a group\nof funds referred to as the \u201c LifePath ETFs, \u201d\neach of which seeks to provide for retirement\noutcomes based on quantitatively measured risk\nthat investors on average may be willing to\naccept given a particular time horizon. Set\nforth below is more detailed information\nregarding types of instruments in which the\nUnderlying Funds, and in some cases, the Fund,\nmay invest, strategies BFA may employ in\npursuit of the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestment objective, and related risks.\nAsset-Backed and Commercial Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities. Certain of the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in asset-backed securities ( \u201c ABS\n\u201d ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities\n( \u201c CMBS \u201d ). ABS are securities backed by\ninstallment contracts, credit-card receivables\nor other assets. CMBS are securities backed by\ncommercial real estate properties. Both ABS\nand CMBS represent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of\nassets in which payments of both interest and\nprincipal on the securities are made on a\nregular basis. The payments are, in effect, \u201c\npassed through \u201d to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). The average\nlife of ABS and CMBS varies with the\nmaturities of the underlying instruments and,\nas a result of prepayments, can often be less\nthan the original maturity of the assets\nunderlying the securities. For this and other\nreasons, the stated maturity of an ABS or CMBS\nmay be shortened, and the security\u2019s total\nreturn may be difficult to predict precisely.\nAlso see Mortgage Pass-Through Securities and\nMortgage Securities below. Beginning in the\nsecond half of 2007 through 2009, the market\nfor ABS and mortgage-backed securities ( \u201c MBS\n\u201d ) experienced substantially, often\ndramatically, lower valuations and reduced\nliquidity. These instruments continue to be\nsubject to liquidity constraints, price\nvolatility, credit downgrades and increases in\ndefault rates and, therefore, may be more\ndifficult to value and more difficult to\ndispose of than previously. Bonds. Certain of\nthe Underlying Funds may invest in bonds. A\nbond is an interest-bearing security issued by\na U.S. or non-U.S. company or governmental\nunit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual\nobligation to pay interest at a stated rate on\nspecific dates and to repay principal (the\nbond\u2019s face value) periodically or on a\nspecified maturity date. Bonds generally are\nused by issuers to borrow money from\ninvestors. An issuer may have the right to\nredeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity, in\nwhich case a fund may have to reinvest the\nproceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a\nfund may have to reinvest interest income or\npayments received when bonds mature, sometimes\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear\ninterest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that is\nfixed for the life of the bond. The value of a\nfixed-rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. When\nan investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a\nprice that is greater than its face value, the\ninvestor is purchasing the bond at a premium.\nConversely, when an investor purchases a\nfixed-rate bond at a price that is less than\nits face value, the investor is purchasing the\nbond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are\npurchased at a discount pay less current\nincome than securities with comparable yields\nthat are purchased at face value, with the\nresult that prices for such fixed-rate\nsecurities can be more volatile than prices\nfor such securities that are purchased at face\nvalue. Other types of bonds bear interest at\nan interest rate that is adjusted\nperiodically. Interest rates on \u201c floating\nrate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds may be\nhigher or lower than current market rates for\nfixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with\nsimilar final maturities. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c\nfloating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline\nif their interest rates do not rise as much,\nor as quickly, as interest rates in general.\nAn Underlying Fund may treat some of these\nbonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio.\nGenerally,\n\n2\n\nprices of higher quality issues tend to\nfluctuate less with changes in market interest\nrates than prices of lower quality issues and\nprices of longer maturity issues tend to\nfluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity\nissues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated\nobligations. Senior obligations generally have\nthe first claim on an issuer\u2019s earnings and\nassets and, in the event of liquidation, are\npaid before subordinated obligations. Bonds\nmay be unsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s\ngeneral creditworthiness) or secured (backed\nby specified collateral). Borrowing. The Fund\nmay borrow for temporary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Corporate Bonds.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may invest in\ninvestment grade and/or high yield corporate\nbonds. The investment return of corporate\nbonds reflects interest earned on the security\nand changes in the market value of the\nsecurity. The market value of a corporate bond\nmay be affected by changes in the market rate\nof interest, the credit rating of the issuer,\nthe issuer\u2019s performance and perceptions of\nthe issuer in the marketplace. There is a risk\nthat the issuers of the securities may not be\nable to meet their obligations on interest or\nprincipal payments at the time called for by\nan instrument. Currency Transactions. A\ncurrency forward contract is an over-the-\ncounter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to purchase or\nsell a specific currency at a future date,\nwhich may be any fixed number of days greater\nthan two days from the date on which the\ncontract is agreed upon by the parties, at a\nprice set at the time of the contract. A non-\ndeliverable currency forward is an OTC\ncurrency forward settled in a specified\ncurrency, on a specified date, based on the\ndifference between the agreed-upon exchange\nrate and the market exchange rate. A currency\nfutures contract is a contract that trades on\nan organized futures exchange involving an\nobligation to deliver or acquire a specified\namount of a specific currency, at a specified\nprice and at a specified future time. Currency\nfutures contracts may be settled on a net cash\npayment basis rather than by the sale and\ndelivery of the underlying currency. The\nUnderlying Funds that may engage in currency\ntransactions do not expect to engage in\ncurrency transactions for the purpose of\nhedging against declines in the value of the\nUnderlying Funds' assets that are denominated\nin a non-U.S. currency. An Underlying Fund may\nenter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Underlying Fund's\nperformance and may lower the Underlying\nFund\u2019s return. Each Underlying Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforwards, options or futures positions were\npoorly correlated with its other investments\nor if it could not close out its positions\nbecause of an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, each Underlying Fund could incur\ntransaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions.\n\n3\n\nDiversification Status. The Fund is classified\nas a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This\nmeans that the Fund may not purchase\nsecurities of an issuer (other than (i)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\nand (ii) securities of other investment\ncompanies) if, with respect to 75% of its\ntotal assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets would be invested in securities\nof that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof that issuer. With respect to the remaining\n25% of its total assets, the Fund may invest\nmore than 5% of its assets in one issuer.\nUnder the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its\nclassification from diversified to non-\ndiversified without shareholder approval. The\nFund intends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Equity Securities. Equity\nsecurities generally have greater price\nvolatility than fixed-income securities. The\nmarket price of equity securities may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nEquity securities may decline in value due to\nfactors affecting equity securities markets\ngenerally; particular industries, sectors or\ngeographic regions represented in those\nmarkets; or individual issuers. The types of\ndevelopments that may affect an issuer of an\nequity security include management\nperformance, financial leverage and reduced\ndemand for the issuer's goods or services.\nCommon and preferred stock represent equity or\nownership interests in an issuer. Preferred\nstock, however, pays dividends at a specified\nrate and has precedence over common stock in\nthe payment of dividends. In the event an\nissuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,\nthe claims of owners of bonds and preferred\nstock take precedence over the claims of those\nwho own common stock. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by the Fund and certain of\nthe Underlying Funds to access its investable\nuniverse, simulate investments that would\notherwise be eligible, facilitate trading or\nto reduce transaction costs. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nThe Fund or an Underlying Fund will not use\nfutures, options on futures or securities\noptions for speculative purposes. The Fund and\neach Underlying Fund intend to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Underlying Funds, has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d in\naccordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with\nrespect to such Funds or an Underlying Fund,\nis not subject to registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA.\nSee the Regulation Regarding Derivatives\nsection of this SAI for more information.\nFutures contracts provide for the future sale\nby one party and purchase by another party of\na specified amount of a specific instrument or\nindex at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Stock index contracts are\nbased on investments that reflect the market\nvalue of common stock of the firms included in\nthe investments. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund will be required to deposit\nwith the broker an amount of cash or cash\nequivalents known as \u201c initial margin, \u201d which\nis similar to a performance bond or good faith\ndeposit on the contract and is returned to the\nFund or an Underlying Fund upon termination of\nthe futures contract if all contractual\nobligations have been satisfied. Subsequent\npayments, known as \u201c variation margin, \u201d will\nbe made to and from the broker daily as the\nprice of the instrument or index underlying\nthe futures contract fluctuates, making the\nlong and short positions in the futures\ncontract more or less valuable, a process\nknown as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any time\nprior to the expiration of a futures contract,\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund may elect to\nclose the position by taking an opposite\nposition, which will operate to terminate the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract.\n\n4\n\nThe potential for loss related to the purchase\nof an option on a futures contract is limited\nto the premium paid for the option plus\ntransaction costs. Because the value of the\noption is fixed at the point of sale, there\nare no daily cash payments by the purchaser to\nreflect changes in the value of the underlying\ncontract; however, the value of the option\nchanges daily and that change would be\nreflected in the NAV of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. The potential for loss\nrelated to writing call options is unlimited.\nThe potential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase and write put and call options on\nfutures contracts that are traded on an\nexchange as a hedge against changes in value\nof its portfolio securities or in anticipation\nof the purchase of securities, and may enter\ninto closing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by the Fund to obtain access to or\ndispose of securities that are otherwise\neligible investments at favorable prices, to\ninvest cash in a securities index that offers\nsimilar exposure to that being sought by the\nFund or otherwise to achieve the Fund's\nobjective. A call option gives a holder the\nright to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase put options to hedge its portfolio\nagainst the risk of a decline in the market\nvalue of securities held and may purchase call\noptions to hedge against an increase in the\nprice of securities it is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nwrite put and call options along with a long\nposition in options to increase its ability to\nhedge against a change in the market value of\nthe securities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase or sell securities options on a U.S.\nor non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC\nmarket through a transaction with a dealer.\nOptions on a securities index are typically\nsettled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). Investments in Underlying Funds.\nEach Underlying Fund is a type of investment\ncompany referred to as an exchange-traded fund\n( \u201c ETF \u201d ). Each Underlying Fund is designed\nto track a particular index and is advised by\nBFA. Shares of the Underlying Funds are listed\nfor trading on national securities exchanges\nand trade throughout the day on those\nexchanges and other secondary markets. There\ncan be no assurance that the requirements of\nthe national securities exchanges necessary to\nmaintain the listing of shares of the\nUnderlying Funds will continue to be met. A\nnational securities exchange may, but is not\nrequired to, remove the shares of the\nUnderlying Funds from listing if, among other\nthings: (i) following the initial 12-month\nperiod beginning upon the commencement of\ntrading of an Underlying Fund, there are fewer\nthan 50 record and/or beneficial holders of\nthe shares for 30 or more consecutive trading\ndays, (ii) the value of an Underlying Fund's\nunderlying index is no longer calculated or\navailable, or (iii) any other event shall\noccur or condition exist that, in the opinion\nof the national securities exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the national securities\nexchange inadvisable. A national securities\nexchange will remove the shares of an\nUnderlying Fund from listing and trading upon\ntermination of such Underlying Fund. Shares of\neach Underlying Fund trade on exchanges at\nprices at, above or below their most recent\nNAV. The per share NAV of each Underlying Fund\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of such Underlying Fund's holdings since\nthe most recent calculation. The trading\nprices of an Underlying Fund's shares\nfluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan NAV. The trading prices of an Underlying\nFund's shares may deviate significantly from\nNAV during periods of market volatility. Any\nof these factors may lead to an Underlying\nFund's shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with an Underlying Fund's\nNAV due to timing reasons as well as market\nsupply and demand factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to an Underlying Fund's creations\nand redemptions or the existence of extreme\nmarket volatility may result in trading prices\nof Underlying Fund shares that differ\nsignificantly from NAV. If the Fund purchases\nshares of the Underlying Funds at a time when\nthe market price of an Underlying Fund's\nshares are at a premium to the NAV or sells at\na time when the market price of an Underlying\nFund is at a discount to the NAV, then the\nFund may sustain losses. As in the case of\nother publicly-traded securities, brokers'\ncommissions on buying or selling shares of the\nUnderlying Funds will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels. An\ninvestment in an ETF generally presents the\nsame primary risks as an investment in an\nopen-end investment company that is not\nexchange-traded and that has the same\ninvestment objectives, strategies, and\npolicies. However, ETFs are subject to the\nfollowing risks that do not apply to an open-\nend investment company that is not exchange-\ntraded: (i) the market price of the ETF's\nshares may trade at a discount to their net\nasset value; (ii) an active trading market for\nan ETF's shares may not develop or be\nmaintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's\n\n5\n\nshares may be halted if the listing exchange's\nofficials deem such action appropriate, the\nshares are delisted from the exchange, or the\nactivation of market-wide \u201c circuit breakers \u201d\n(which are tied to large swings in stock\nprices) halts stock trading generally. Lending\nPortfolio Securities. The Fund may lend\nportfolio securities to certain borrowers that\nBFA determines to be creditworthy, including\nborrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers\nprovide collateral that is maintained in an\namount at least equal to the current market\nvalue of the securities loaned. No securities\nloan shall be made on behalf of the Fund if,\nas a result, the aggregate value of all\nsecurities loans of the Fund exceeds one-third\nof the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nThe Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that\nthe Fund engages in securities lending,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities lending agent for\nthe Fund, subject to the overall supervision\nof BFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d )\nserves as custodian for the Fund in connection\nwith certain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the Fund\u2019s securities as agreed,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to participate in a\ncorporate action event may be impacted, or the\nFund may experience losses if the proceeds\nreceived from liquidating the collateral do\nnot at least equal the value of the loaned\nsecurity at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nThis latter event could trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. The Fund could lose\nmoney if its short-term investment of the\ncollateral declines in value over the period\nof the loan. Substitute payments received by\nthe Fund representing dividends paid on\nsecurities loaned out by the Fund will not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. BTC will\ntake into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nprogram. Substitute payments received on tax-\nexempt securities loaned out will not be tax-\nexempt income. There could also be changes in\nthe status of issuers under applicable laws\nand regulations, including tax regulations,\nthat may impact the regulatory or tax\ntreatment of loaned securities and could, for\nexample, result in a delay in the payment of\ndividend equivalent payments owed to the Fund\n(as permitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate\nsuch agreements, foreclose upon collateral,\nexercise other default rights or restrict\ntransfers of credit support in the event that\nthe counterparty and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to certain types of resolution or\ninsolvency proceedings. It is possible that\nthese requirements, as well as potential\nadditional government\n\n6\n\nregulation and other developments in the\nmarket, could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nability to terminate existing securities\nlending agreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including ETFs such as the\nFund, to establish a liquidity risk management\nprogram (the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and\nenhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity.\nAs required by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund\nhas implemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by the Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that the Fund\ncould not meet requests to redeem shares\nissued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment-\nspecific considerations under the Liquidity\nProgram. There are exclusions from certain\nportions of the liquidity risk management\nprogram requirements for \u201c in-kind \u201d ETFs, as\ndefined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent\nthat an investment is deemed to be an illiquid\ninvestment or a less liquid investment, the\nFund can expect to be exposed to greater\nliquidity risk. Non-Diversification Risk.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may be\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat the Underlying Funds may invest a large\npercentage of its assets in securities issued\nby or representing a small number of issuers.\nAs a result, the Underlying Funds may be more\nsusceptible to the risks associated with these\nparticular issuers or to a single economic,\npolitical or regulatory occurrence affecting\nthese issuers. Non-U.S. Securities and\nEmerging Markets Securities. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in the securities\nof non-U.S. issuers, which involves special\nrisks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\npotentially confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability which could\naffect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries,\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital, generally less liquid\nand less efficient securities markets,\ngenerally greater price volatility, less\npublicly available information about issuers,\nhigher transaction and custody costs, delays\nand risks attendant in settlement procedures,\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations, less developed judicial systems\nto settle disputes, lesser liquidity and\nsignificantly smaller market capitalization of\nmost non-U.S. securities markets, substantial\ngovernment interference with the economy and\ntransaction costs of foreign currency\nconversions. The Underlying Funds may have\ndifficulty valuing such securities due to\nthese or other considerations. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual foreign economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nwith respect to growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nIn addition, changes in foreign exchange rates\nalso will affect the value of securities\ndenominated or quoted in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. Certain foreign markets have\nspecific geographical risks such as a\nheightened likelihood of earthquakes,\ntsunamis, or volcanoes. Certain foreign\nmarkets also experience acts of terrorism,\nterritorial disputes or other defense\nconcerns. These situations may have a\nsignificant impact on the economies of, and\ninvestments in, these geographic areas. To the\nextent an Underlying Fund invests in publicly\ntraded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers,\ncertain investments in such stocks may be in\nthe form of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c\nADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs\n\u201d ) and European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs\n\u201d ) (collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nforeign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as Continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, in\nbearer form, are designed for use in European\nsecurities markets. GDRs are tradable both in\nthe U.S. and in Europe and are designed for\nuse throughout the world. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest in depositary\nreceipts through \u201c sponsored \u201d or \u201c\nunsponsored \u201d facilities. A sponsored facility\nis established jointly by the issuer of the\nunderlying security and a depositary, whereas\na depositary may establish an unsponsored\nfacility without participation by the issuer\nof the deposited security. Holders of\nunsponsored depositary receipts generally bear\nall the costs of such facilities and the\ndepositary of an unsponsored facility\nfrequently is under no obligation to\ndistribute interest holder communications\nreceived from the issuer of the deposited\nsecurity or to pass through voting rights to\nthe holders of such receipts in respect of the\ndeposited securities. The issuers of\nunsponsored depositary receipts are not\nobligated to disclose\n\n7\n\nmaterial information in the U.S. and,\ntherefore, there may be less information\navailable regarding such issuers and there may\nnot be a correlation between such information\nand the market value of the depositary\nreceipts. Depositary receipts are generally\nsubject to the same risks as the foreign\nsecurities that they evidence or into which\nthey may be converted. In addition to\ninvestment risks associated with the\nunderlying issuer, depositary receipts expose\neach Underlying Fund to additional risks\nassociated with the non-uniform terms that\napply to depositary receipt programs, credit\nexposure to the depository bank and to the\nsponsors and other parties with whom the\ndepository bank establishes the programs,\ncurrency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored\nprograms, which are not sanctioned by the\nissuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Obligations of Foreign\nGovernments, Supranational Entities and Banks\n. The Fund and certain of the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in U.S. dollar-denominated short-\nterm obligations issued or guaranteed by one\nor more foreign governments or any of their\npolitical subdivisions, agencies or\ninstrumentalities that are determined by BFA\nto be of comparable quality to the other\nobligations in which such Underlying Funds may\ninvest. Certain foreign governments,\nspecifically foreign governments in emerging\nmarkets, historically have encountered\ndifficulties in servicing their debt\nobligations, withheld payments of principal\nand interest, and declared moratoria on the\npayment of principal and interest on their\nsovereign debts. Certain of the Underlying\nFunds may also invest in debt obligations of\nsupranational entities. Supranational entities\ninclude international organizations designated\nor supported by governmental entities to\npromote economic reconstruction or development\nand international banking institutions and\nrelated government agencies. Examples include\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (the World Bank), the Asian\nDevelopment Bank and the InterAmerican\nDevelopment Bank. The percentage of the\nUnderlying Funds\u2019 assets invested in\nobligations of foreign governments and\nsupranational entities will vary depending on\nthe relative yields of such securities, the\neconomic and financial markets of the\ncountries in which the investments are made\nand the interest rate climate of such\ncountries. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest a portion of their total assets in\nhigh-quality, short-term (one year or less)\ndebt obligations of foreign branches of U.S.\nbanks or U.S. branches of foreign banks that\nare denominated in and pay interest in U.S.\ndollars. Emerging Markets. Some non-U.S.\nmarkets in which certain of the Underlying\nFunds invest are considered to be emerging\nmarkets. Investment in these emerging markets\nsubjects an Underlying Fund to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in developed markets.\nThis is due to, among other things, greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume,\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nrisk of market shut down and more governmental\nlimitations on foreign investment policy than\nthose typically found in developed markets.\nRatings. An investment-grade rating generally\nmeans the security or issuer is rated\ninvestment-grade by one or more of Moody\u2019s,\nS&P Global Ratings, Fitch, Dominion Bond\nRating Service Limited ( \u201c Dominion \u201d ), or\nanother credit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by BFA.\nGenerally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by\nMoody\u2019s, BBBL or above by Dominion or BBB- or\nabove by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch are\nconsidered \u201c investment-grade \u201d securities,\nbonds rated Baa are considered medium grade\nobligations subject to moderate credit risk\nand may possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics, while bonds rated BBB are\nregarded as having adequate capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments. Subsequent to purchase\nby the applicable Underlying Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its rating\nmay be reduced below an investment-grade\nrating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or Fitch are\ngenerally considered below investment-grade\nquality and are obligations of issuers that\nare generally considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer\u2019s\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and,\ntherefore, carry greater investment risk,\nincluding the possibility of issuer default\nand bankruptcy and increased market price\nvolatility. Such lower-rated securities are\ncommonly referred to as \u201c junk bonds \u201d and are\nsubject to a substantial degree of credit\nrisk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a\ndescription of each rating category of\nMoody's, S&P Global Ratings, Fitch and\nDominion and BFA's treatment of investments\nthat are not rated by any of the rating\nagencies. Regulation Regarding Derivatives.\nThe CFTC subjects advisers to registered\ninvestment companies to regulation by the CFTC\nif a fund that is advised by the adviser\neither (i) invests, directly or indirectly,\nmore than a prescribed level of its\nliquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures,\noptions and swaps ( \u201c CFTC Derivatives \u201d ) or\n(ii) markets itself as providing investment\nexposure to such instruments. The CFTC also\nsubjects advisers to registered investment\ncompanies to regulation\n\n8\n\nby the CFTC if the registered investment\ncompany invests in one or more commodity\npools. To the extent the Fund uses CFTC\nDerivatives, it intends to do so below such\nprescribed levels and intends not to market\nitself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a vehicle\nfor trading such instruments. BFA has claimed\nan exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\npursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) has investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and investment companies\nthat may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any\nof the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed\nby the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not\nhave transparency into the holdings of these\nunderlying funds because they are not advised\nby BFA. To address this issue of lack of\ntransparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for the Fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of the Fund.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to the Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in the Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits the Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Fund,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which the Fund\nis or may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions (e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if the Fund elects to\ntreat these transactions as Derivatives\nTransactions under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-\nissued or forward-settling securities (e.g.,\nfirm and standby commitments, including to-be-\nannounced ( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar\nrolls) and non-standard settlement cycle\nsecurities, unless the Fund intends to\nphysically settle the transaction and the\ntransaction will settle within 35 days of its\ntrade date (the \u201c Delayed-Settlement\nSecurities Provision \u201d ). Unless the Fund is\nrelying on the Limited Derivatives User\nException (as defined below), the Fund must\ncomply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to its\nDerivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among\nother things, requires the Fund to adopt and\nimplement a comprehensive written derivatives\nrisk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d ) and\ncomply with a relative or absolute limit on\nFund leverage risk calculated based on value-\nat-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is administered\nby a \u201c derivatives risk manager, \u201d who is\nappointed by the Board, including a majority\nof Independent Directors/Trustees, and\nperiodically reviews the DRMP and reports to\nthe Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ).\n\n9\n\nRepurchase Agreements. A repurchase agreement\nis an instrument under which the purchaser (\ni.e. , an Underlying Fund) acquires a security\nand the seller agrees, at the time of the\nsale, to repurchase the security at a mutually\nagreed-upon time and price, thereby\ndetermining the yield during the purchaser\u2019s\nholding period. Repurchase agreements may be\nconstrued to be collateralized loans by the\npurchaser to the seller secured by the\nsecurities transferred to the purchaser. If a\nrepurchase agreement is construed to be a\ncollateralized loan, the underlying securities\nwill not be considered to be owned by an\nUnderlying Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Underlying Fund may\nsuffer time delays and incur costs or losses\nin connection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nan Underlying Fund that utilizes them. Such\nrisks are not unique to the Underlying Funds,\nbut are inherent in repurchase agreements. The\nUnderlying Funds seek to minimize such risks,\nbut because of the inherent legal\nuncertainties involved in repurchase\nagreements, such risks cannot be eliminated.\nLower quality collateral and collateral with a\nlonger maturity may be subject to greater\nprice fluctuations than higher quality\ncollateral and collateral with a shorter\nmaturity. If the repurchase agreement\ncounterparty were to default, lower quality\ncollateral may be more difficult to liquidate\nthan higher quality collateral. Should the\ncounterparty default and the amount of\ncollateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, an\nUnderlying Fund would likely retain the status\nof an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (\ni.e. , the position an Underlying Fund would\nnormally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to\nits investment policies, other unsecured debt\nsecurities of the defaulting counterparty)\nwith respect to the amount of the shortfall.\nAs an unsecured creditor, an Underlying Fund\nwould be at risk of losing some or all of the\nprincipal and income involved in the\ntransaction. Reverse Repurchase Agreements.\nReverse repurchase agreements involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. Generally, the\neffect of such transactions is that the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund can recover all or most\nof the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund or an Underlying Fund is able\nto keep some of the interest income associated\nwith those securities. Such transactions are\nadvantageous only if the Fund or an Underlying\nFund has an opportunity to earn a rate of\ninterest on the cash derived from these\ntransactions that is greater than the interest\ncost of obtaining the same amount of cash.\nOpportunities to realize earnings from the use\nof the proceeds equal to or greater than the\ninterest required to be paid may not always be\navailable, and the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nintends to use the reverse repurchase\ntechnique only when BFA believes it will be\nadvantageous to the Fund or an Underlying\nFund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund or Underlying Fund\u2019s assets.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements is a\nform of leverage, and the proceeds obtained\nthrough reverse repurchase agreements may be\ninvested in additional securities. Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act permits the\nFund or an Underlying Fund to enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that the\nFund or an Underlying Fund either (i) complies\nwith the 300% asset coverage ratio with\nrespect to such transactions and any other\nborrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats\nsuch transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives \u201d above.) Securities of Investment\nCompanies. Each Underlying Fund may invest in\nthe securities of other investment companies\n(including money market funds) to the extent\npermitted by law, regulation, exemptive order\nor SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a\nfund\u2019s investment in investment companies is\nlimited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i)\n3% of the total outstanding voting stock of\nany one investment company, (ii) 5% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which an Underlying Fund invests\ncan be expected to incur fees and expenses for\noperations, such as investment advisory and\nadministration fees, which would be in\naddition to those incurred by an Underlying\nFund.\n\n10\n\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\nthe Fund's pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable). An Underlying Fund\nmay purchase ETF shares for the same reason it\nwould purchase (and as an alternative to\npurchasing) futures contracts \u2013 to obtain\nrelatively low-cost exposure to the stock\nmarket while maintaining flexibility to meet\nthe liquidity needs of the Underlying Fund.\nETF shares enjoy several advantages over\nfutures contracts. Depending on the market,\nthe holding period, and other factors, ETF\nshares can be less costly than futures\ncontracts. In addition, ETF shares can be\npurchased for smaller sums and offer exposure\nto market sectors and styles for which there\nis no suitable or liquid futures contract. An\nUnderlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares\nfor other purposes, including improving its\nability to track its underlying index. An\nUnderlying Fund may invest in shares of ETFs\nthat are advised by BFA. Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. The\nFund and the Underlying Funds may invest in\nshort-term instruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019\nacceptances, fixed-time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global\nRatings, or if unrated, of comparable quality\nas determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by the Fund. Any\nof these instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. See Risks of the Underlying\nFunds below. Swap Agreements. Swap agreements\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on a pre-determined\nunderlying investment or notional amount. In\nreturn, the other party agrees to make\nperiodic payments to the first party based on\nthe return (or a differential in rate of\nreturn) earned or realized on the underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. Swap agreements\nwill usually be performed on a net basis, with\neach Underlying Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of an Underlying\nFund\u2019s obligations over its entitlements with\nrespect to each swap is accrued on a daily\nbasis. The Fund or certain Underlying Funds\nmay enter into currency swaps, interest rate\nswaps and index swaps. The use of swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. These transactions\ngenerally do not involve the delivery of\nsecurities or other underlying assets.\nTracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. U.S. Government\nObligations. The Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay invest in various types of U.S. government\nobligations. U.S. government obligations are a\ntype of bond and include securities issued or\nguaranteed as to principal and interest by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities. Payment of principal and\ninterest on U.S. government obligations (i)\nmay be backed by the full faith and credit of\nthe U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the\nissuing or guaranteeing agency or\ninstrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac and FHLB notes). In the latter\ncase, the Fund or an Underlying Fund must look\nprincipally to the agency or instrumentality\nissuing or guaranteeing the obligation for\nultimate repayment, which agency or\ninstrumentality may be privately owned. There\ncan be no assurance that the U.S. government\nwould provide financial support to its\nagencies or instrumentalities where it is not\nobligated to do so. As a general matter, the\nvalue of debt\n\n11\n\ninstruments, including U.S. government\nobligations, declines when market interest\nrates increase and rises when market interest\nrates decrease. Certain types of U.S.\ngovernment obligations are subject to\nfluctuations in yield or value due to their\nstructure or contract terms. Future\nDevelopments. The Board may, in the future,\nauthorize each Underlying Fund to invest in\nsecurities contracts and investments, other\nthan those listed in this SAI and in the\nProspectus, provided they are consistent with\nthe Fund's or Underlying Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. Because the Fund expects to obtain\nits exposure to the securities substantially\nthrough its investment in the Underlying\nFunds, shareholders should be aware that the\nrisks of investment in particular types of\nsecurities, economic sectors and geographic\nlocations discussed below may be borne by the\nFund through its investment in the Underlying\nFunds. Through its investment in the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund will also bear the\nrisks described below associated with the\nUnderlying Funds' use of portfolio management\ntechniques, such as borrowing arrangements and\nuse of derivatives, in addition to the risks\nassociated with those activities if the Fund\nengages in them directly. An investment in the\nFund should be made with an understanding that\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities,\nincluding its investment in the Underlying\nFunds, may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof stocks in general, and other factors that\naffect the market. The order of the below risk\nfactors does not indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Call Risk. During periods of\nfalling interest rates, an issuer of a\ncallable bond held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or repay the\nsecurity before its stated maturity, and the\nFund or an Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in securities with lower\nyields, which would result in a decline in\nincome, or in securities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable features.\nCommodities Investment Risk. Exposure to\ncommodities markets may subject the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to greater volatility than\ninvestments in traditional securities. The\ncommodities markets have experienced periods\nof extreme volatility. Similar future market\nconditions may result in rapid and substantial\nvaluation increases or decreases in the Fund\u2019s\nor Underlying Fund's holdings. The commodities\nmarkets may fluctuate widely based on a\nvariety of factors. Movements in commodity\ninvestment prices are outside of the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's control and may not be\nanticipated by BFA. Price movements may be\ninfluenced by, among other things:\ngovernmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal,\nmonetary and exchange control programs and\npolicies; changing market and economic\nconditions; market liquidity; weather and\nclimate conditions, including droughts and\nfloods; livestock disease; changing supply and\ndemand relationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities.\n\n12\n\nA decrease in the production of a physical\ncommodity or a decrease in the volume of such\ncommodity available for transportation,\nmining, processing, storage or distribution\nmay adversely impact the financial performance\nof a commodity or commodity-related company\nthat devotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. The Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, certain debt obligations may\nbe paid off substantially more slowly than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply, resulting in a\ndecline in the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\nincome and potentially in the value of the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's investments.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\n\n13\n\npolitical impacts, as well as general concern\nand uncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate\nother pre-existing political, social and\neconomic risks in certain countries or\nglobally. These impacts, which could adversely\naffect a Fund and its investments, could be\npresent for an extended period of time. In\naddition, markets may experience temporary\nclosures, extreme volatility, severe losses,\nreduced liquidity and increased trading costs.\nSuch events may adversely affect a Fund and\nits investments and may impact a Fund\u2019s\nability to purchase or sell securities or\nother assets. Market or economic disruptions\ncould cause elevated tracking error and\nincreased premiums or discounts to a Fund's\nNAV. Additionally, a Fund could be adversely\nimpacted if an outbreak impairs the operations\nof its service providers, including BFA.\nGovernmental and quasi-governmental may\nrespond to an outbreak and any resulting\ndisruptions with a variety of fiscal and\nmonetary policy changes, such as changes in\ninterest rates. A reversal of these policies,\nor the ineffectiveness of such policies, is\nlikely to increase market volatility, which\ncould adversely affect a Fund\u2019s investments.\nOperational Risk. BFA and the Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Prepayment Risk. During\nperiods of falling interest rates, issuers of\ncertain debt obligations may repay principal\nprior to the security\u2019s maturity, which may\ncause the Fund or an Underlying Fund to have\nto reinvest in securities with lower yields or\nhigher risk of default, resulting in a decline\nin the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's income or\nreturn potential. Also, if a security subject\nto prepayment had been purchased at a premium,\nthe value of the premium would be lost in the\nevent of prepayment. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may be exposed to financial instruments\nthat recently transitioned from, or continue\nto be tied to, the London Interbank Offered\nRate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d ) to determine payment\nobligations, financing terms, hedging\nstrategies or investment value. The United\nKingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority ( \u201c FCA\n\u201d ), which regulates LIBOR, has ceased\npublishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023,\nhowever, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR\nsettings will continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may have instruments linked to\nother interbank offered rates that may also\ncease to be published in the future. Risk of\nDerivatives. A derivative is a financial\ncontract, the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying\nasset, such as a security, a commodity (such\nas gold or silver), a currency or an index (a\nmeasure of value or rates, such as the S&P 500\nor the prime lending rate). The Fund and\ncertain Underlying Funds may invest in stock\nindex futures contracts, securities options\nand other derivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's losses may be greater if\n\n14\n\nit invests in derivatives than if it invests\nonly in conventional securities. Derivatives\nare also subject to counterparty risk, which\nis the risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage. When a derivative is\nused as a hedge against a position that the\nFund holds or is committed to purchase, any\nloss generated by the derivative generally\nshould be substantially offset by gains on the\nhedged investment, and vice versa. While\nhedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can\nalso reduce or eliminate gains, and in some\ncases, hedging can cause losses that are not\noffset by gains, and the Fund will recognize\nlosses on both the investment and the hedge.\nHedges are sometimes subject to imperfect\nmatching between the derivative and the\nunderlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that the Fund\u2019s hedging\ntransactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risks of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of an Underlying Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof preferred or common stocks in general and\nother factors that affect the market. An\ninvestment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in equity securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of\nissuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the stock market may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of shares of\nan Underlying Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as market confidence and\nperceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Holders of common stocks incur more\nrisk than holders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders\ngenerally have rights to receive payments from\nthe issuer inferior to the rights of creditors\nor holders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however, is\nsubject to market fluctuations prior to\nmaturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Risk of Futures and Options on\nFutures Transactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nunderlying instrument. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of loss of margin deposits\nin the event of bankruptcy of a broker with\nwhom the Fund has an open position in the\nfutures contract or option. The purchase of\nput or call options will be based upon\npredictions by BFA as to anticipated trends,\nwhich predictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of\n\n15\n\ncontract, no trades may be made on that day at\na price beyond that limit. It is possible that\nfutures contract prices could move to the\ndaily limit for several consecutive trading\ndays with little or no trading, thereby\npreventing prompt liquidation of futures\npositions and subjecting the Fund to\nsubstantial losses. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would be required to\nmake daily cash payments of variation margin.\nRisk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities.\nNon-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign\nexchanges and OTC in the respective countries\ncovered by the Fund or an Underlying Fund. The\nrisks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities\ntypically include market fluctuations caused\nby such factors as economic and political\ndevelopments, changes in interest rates and\nperceived trends in bond prices. Investing in\na fund whose portfolio contains securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the securities of U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include securities markets that\nmay lack sufficient liquidity or may be less\nefficient; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization of most non-U.S.\nsecurities markets; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy; higher rates of inflation; greater\nsocial, economic, and political uncertainty;\nthe risk of nationalization or expropriation\nof assets; and different bankruptcy and\ninsolvency regimes which may stay or prevent\nrecovery in the event of an issuer\u2019s default.\nRisk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity\nSecurities. An investment in non-U.S. equity\nsecurities involves risks similar to those of\ninvesting in portfolios of equity securities\ntraded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks\ninclude market fluctuations caused by such\nfactors as economic and political developments\nin those foreign countries, changes in\ninterest rates and perceived trends in stock\nprices. Investing in securities issued by\nissuers domiciled in countries other than the\ndomicile of the investor and denominated in\ncurrencies other than an investor\u2019s local\ncurrency entails certain considerations and\nrisks not typically encountered by the\ninvestor in making investments in its home\ncountry and in that country\u2019s currency. These\nconsiderations include favorable or\nunfavorable changes in interest rates,\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations and the costs that may be incurred\nin connection with conversions between various\ncurrencies. Because certain Underlying Funds\ninvest in non-U.S. equity securities,\ninvesting in this Fund also involves certain\nrisks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in a fund whose\nportfolio contains exclusively securities of\nU.S. issuers. These risks include generally\nless liquid and less efficient securities\nmarkets; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Underlying Funds; higher transaction and\ncustody costs; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy and businesses; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nis contractually obligated to make. Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund or an Underlying Fund will have\ncontractual remedies pursuant to the\nagreements related to the transaction.\nHowever, such remedies may be subject to\nbankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could\naffect the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's rights\nas a creditor ( e.g. , the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may not receive the net amount\nof payments that it is contractually entitled\nto receive). The Fund or an Underlying Fund is\nrequired to post and collect variation margin\nand initial margin (comprised of specified\nliquid securities subject to haircuts) in\nconnection with trading of OTC swaps. These\nrequirements may raise the costs for the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's investment in\nswaps. Tracking Error Risk. The Underlying\nFunds may be subject to tracking error, which\nis the divergence of a fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of its underlying index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments held in a\nfund\u2019s portfolio and those included in an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s underlying index, pricing\ndifferences, transaction costs incurred by the\nUnderlying Funds, Underlying Funds\u2019 holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by an Underlying Fund or\ndistributions paid to an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to maintain\npass-through tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to minimize\n\n16\n\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to an Underlying Fund\u2019s underlying\nindex or the costs to an Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result because a fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while such a fund\u2019s\nunderlying index does not. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by an Underlying Funds, BFA may\nconduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the re-\nbalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does\nso, such a fund will be subject to increased\ntracking error due to the divergence in the\nsecurities included in its portfolio from its\nunderlying index. The application of the\nabove-mentioned analysis and screening to an\nUnderlying Fund and its underlying index is in\nthe sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates\n(without any guarantees). The analysis and\nscreening may not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nsuch a Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more\nsuch securities declines in value. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations Risk. U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of\nissuance and other characteristics. Similar to\nother issuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's\nU.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S.\nTreasury securities are rated AA+ by S&P\nGlobal Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of\nU.S. Treasury securities may cause the value\nof the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Because U.S. government debt\nobligations are often used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a downgrade\ncould also result in higher interest rates for\na range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the\ninternational bond markets and have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the U.S. and\nglobal economy. A high national debt level may\nincrease market pressures to meet government\nfunding needs, which may drive debt cost\nhigher and lead the government to issue\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that the U.S. government will\nnot be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. If market\nparticipants determine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become unsustainable, the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary pressures,\nparticularly with respect to services\noutsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods and constrain or prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S., circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in losses to the\nFund and substantial negative consequences for\nthe U.S. economy and the global financial\nsystem. Risk of Investing in Africa.\nInvestments in securities of issuers in\ncertain African countries involve heightened\nrisks including, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, political instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military involvement in\ngovernmental decision-making, armed conflict,\ncivil war, and social instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic\nunrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and,\nin certain countries, genocidal warfare.\nCertain countries in Africa generally have\nless developed capital markets than\ntraditional emerging market countries, and,\nconsequently, the risks of investing in\nforeign securities are magnified in such\ncountries. Because securities markets of\ncountries in Africa are generally\nunderdeveloped and are generally less\ncorrelated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether.\n\n17\n\nMarket volatility may also be heightened by\nthe actions of a small number of investors.\nBrokerage firms in certain countries in Africa\nmay be fewer in number and less established\nthan brokerage firms in more developed\nmarkets. Since the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay need to effect securities transactions\nthrough these brokerage firms, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund is subject to the risk that\nthese brokerage firms will not be able to\nfulfill their obligations to the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund ( i.e., counterparty risk).\nThis risk is magnified to the extent that the\nFund or an Underlying Fund effects securities\ntransactions through a single brokerage firm\nor a small number of brokerage firms. Certain\ngovernments in African countries restrict or\ncontrol to varying degrees the ability of\nforeign investors to invest in securities of\nissuers located or operating in those\ncountries. Moreover, certain countries in\nAfrica require governmental approval or\nspecial licenses prior to investment by\nforeign investors and may limit the amount of\ninvestment by foreign investors in a\nparticular industry and/or issuer, and may\nlimit such foreign investment to a certain\nclass of securities of an issuer that may have\nless advantageous rights than the classes\navailable for purchase by domestic investors\nof the countries and/or impose additional\ntaxes on foreign investors. A delay in\nobtaining a government approval or a license\nwould delay investments in a particular\ncountry, and, as a result, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may not be able to invest in\ncertain securities while approval is pending.\nThe government of a particular country may\nalso withdraw or decline to renew a license\nthat enables the Fund or an Underlying Fund to\ninvest in such country. These factors make\ninvesting in issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa significantly riskier than\ninvesting in issuers located or operating in\nmore developed countries, and any one of these\nfactors could cause a decline in the value of\nthe Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa are generally not subject\nto the same rules and regulations as issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. Therefore, there may be less\nfinancial and other information publicly\navailable with regard to issuers located or\noperating in countries in Africa and such\nissuers are generally not subject to the\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest may levy\nwithholding or other taxes on income such as\ndividends, interest and realized capital\ngains. Although in certain countries in Africa\na portion of these taxes are recoverable, the\nnon-recovered portion of foreign withholding\ntaxes will reduce the income received from\ninvestments in such countries. Investment in\ncountries in Africa may be subject to a\ngreater degree of risk associated with\ngovernmental approval in connection with the\nrepatriation of investment income, capital or\nthe proceeds of sales of securities by foreign\ninvestors. In addition, there is the risk that\nif an African country\u2019s balance of payments\ndeclines, such African country may impose\ntemporary restrictions on foreign capital\nremittances. Consequently, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund could be adversely affected by\ndelays in, or a refusal to grant, required\ngovernmental approval for repatriation of\ncapital, as well as by the application to the\nFund or the Underlying Funds of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund to adopt\nspecial procedures, seek local government\napprovals or take other actions, each of which\nmay involve additional costs to the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. Securities laws in many\ncountries in Africa are relatively new and\nunsettled and, consequently, there is a risk\nof rapid and unpredictable change in laws\nregarding foreign investment, securities\nregulation, title to securities and\nshareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign\ninvestors may be adversely affected by new or\namended laws and regulations. In addition,\nthere may be no single centralized securities\nexchange on which securities are traded in\ncertain countries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests may operate in, or\n\n18\n\nhave dealings with, countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations, and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. A\nFund or an Underlying Fund, as an investor in\nsuch issuers, will be indirectly subject to\nthose risks. The governments of certain\ncountries in Africa may exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of the private\nsector and may own or control many companies.\nFuture government actions could have a\nsignificant effect on the economic conditions\nin such countries, which could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Africa.\nSome countries in Africa may be affected by a\ngreater degree of public corruption and crime,\nincluding organized crime. Political\ninstability and protests in North Africa and\nthe Middle East have caused and may in the\nfuture cause significant disruptions to many\nindustries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola\nin Western Africa severely challenged health\ncare industries in those countries and\nadversely impacted the region\u2019s economy due to\nquarantines and disruptions of trade, which\nhas further increased instability in the\nregion. This instability has demonstrated that\npolitical and social unrest can spread quickly\nthrough the region, and that developments in\none country can influence the political events\nin neighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in a Fund or\nan Underlying Fund. Risk of Investing in Asia.\nInvestments in securities of issuers in\ncertain Asian countries involve risks not\ntypically associated with investments in\nsecurities of issuers in other regions. Such\nheightened risks include, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of\nintellectual property, data and other security\nbreaches (especially of data stored\nelectronically), political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict and social instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse\n\n19\n\neconomic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by the relevant Underlying\nFunds. The economies of Australia and New\nZealand are dependent on trading with certain\nkey trading partners, including Asia and the\nU.S. The economies of Australia and New\nZealand are heavily dependent on the mining\nsector. Passage of new regulations limiting\nforeign ownership of companies in the mining\nsector or imposition of new taxes on profits\nof mining companies may dissuade foreign\ninvestment, and as a result, have a negative\nimpact on companies to which the Underlying\nFunds have exposure. Risk of Investing in\nCentral and South America. The economies of\ncertain Central and South American countries\nhave experienced high interest rates, economic\nvolatility, inflation, currency devaluations,\ngovernment defaults, high unemployment rates\nand political instability which can adversely\naffect issuers in these countries. In\naddition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof the region's exports and many economies in\nthis region are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on other countries\nof this region. The governments of certain\ncountries in Central and South America may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on the securities\nin which the Fund or an Underlying Fund\ninvests. Diplomatic developments may also\nadversely affect investments in certain\ncountries in Central and South America. Some\ncountries in Central and South America may be\naffected by public corruption and crime,\nincluding organized crime. Certain countries\nin Central and South America may be heavily\ndependent upon international trade and,\nconsequently, have been and may continue to be\nnegatively affected by trade barriers,\nexchange controls, managed adjustments in\nrelative currency values and other\nprotectionist measures imposed or negotiated\nby the countries with which they trade. These\ncountries also have been and may continue to\nbe adversely affected by economic conditions\nin the countries with which they trade. In\naddition, certain issuers located in countries\nin Central and South America in which the\nUnderlying Fund invests may be the subject of\nsanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed\nsanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals,\ncorporate entities and the Venezuelan\ngovernment) or have dealings with countries\nsubject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed\nby the U.S. government and the United Nations\nand/or countries identified by the U.S.\ngovernment as state sponsors of terrorism. An\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer that has\ndealings with such countries. The Underlying\nFunds may be adversely affected if they invest\nin such issuers. Risk of Investing in China.\nInvestments in securities of companies\ndomiciled in China involve a high degree of\nrisk and special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities markets. Such heightened risks\ninclude, among others, an authoritarian\ngovernment, popular unrest associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions, the impact of regional\nconflict on the economy and hostile relations\nwith neighboring countries. Military\nconflicts, either in response to internal\nsocial unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\n\n20\n\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. China could be\naffected by military events on the Korean\npeninsula or internal instability within North\nKorea. These situations may cause uncertainty\nin the Chinese market and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking, and investing in\nChina involves risk of loss due to\nexpropriation, nationalization, confiscation\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested. The Fund may\ninvest in securities issued by variable\ninterest entities ( \u201c VIEs \u201d ), which are\nsubject to the investment risks associated\nwith the underlying Chinese operating company.\nA VIE enters into service contracts and other\ncontracts with the Chinese operating company,\nwhich provide the VIE with exposure to the\ncompany. Although the VIE has no equity\nownership of the Chinese operating company,\nthe contractual arrangements permit the VIE to\nconsolidate the Chinese operating company into\nits financial statements. Intervention by the\nChinese government with respect to VIEs could\nsignificantly affect the Chinese operating\ncompany\u2019s performance and the enforceability\nof the VIE\u2019s contractual arrangements with the\nChinese company. In addition, there is less\nregulation and monitoring of Chinese\nsecurities markets and the activities of\ninvestors, brokers and other participants than\nin the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities\nin China, including Chinese companies that are\nlisted on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulation as are U.S.\nissuers with respect to such matters as\ninsider trading rules, tender offer\nregulation, accounting standards or auditor\noversight, stockholder proxy requirements and\nthe requirements mandating timely and accurate\ndisclosure of information. Securities markets\nin China are in the process of change and\nfurther development. This may lead to trading\nvolatility, difficulty in the settlement and\nrecording of transactions and difficulty in\ninterpreting and applying the relevant\nregulation. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Underlying Funds\ndo not select investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. While the Chinese\neconomy has experienced past periods of rapid\ngrowth, there is no assurance that such growth\nrates will recur. China may experience\nsubstantial rates of inflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic recessions, causing a\nnegative effect on the economy and securities\nmarket. China\u2019s economy is heavily dependent\non export growth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the Chinese issuers of securities in which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund invests. For\nexample, the U.S. has added certain foreign\ntechnology companies to the U.S. Department of\nCommerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s \u201c\nEntity List, \u201d which is a list of companies\nbelieved to pose a national security risk to\nthe U.S. Actions like these may have\nunanticipated and disruptive effects on the\nChinese economy. Any such response that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. The tax laws and\nregulations in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n( \u201c PRC \u201d ) are subject to change, including\nthe issuance of authoritative guidance or\nenforcement, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThe interpretation, applicability and\nenforcement of such laws by PRC tax\nauthorities are not as consistent and\ntransparent as those of more developed\nnations, and may vary over time and from\nregion to region. The application and\nenforcement of PRC tax rules could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund and its investors,\nparticularly in relation to capital gains\nwithholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In\naddition, the accounting, auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards and practices\napplicable to Chinese companies may be less\nrigorous, and may result in significant\ndifferences between financial statements\nprepared in accordance with the PRC accounting\nstandards and practice and those prepared in\naccordance with international accounting\nstandards.\n\n21\n\nRisk of Investing in the Chinese Equity\nMarkets. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest in H-shares (securities of companies\nincorporated in the PRC that are denominated\nin Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong ( \u201c SEHK \u201d )), A-shares\n(securities of companies incorporated in the\nPRC that are denominated in renminbi and\nlisted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange ( \u201c SSE\n\u201d ) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange ( \u201c SZSE \u201d\n)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies\nincorporated in the PRC that are denominated\nin U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or\nHong Kong dollars (in the case of the SZSE)\nand listed on the SSE and the SZSE). The\nUnderlying Funds may also invest in certain\nHong Kong-listed securities known as Red-Chips\n(securities issued by companies that are\nincorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions\nand that are controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by entities owned by the national\ngovernment or local governments in the PRC and\nderive substantial revenues from or allocate\nsubstantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips\n(securities issued by companies that are\nincorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions\nand that are controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by individuals in the PRC and\nderive substantial revenues from or allocate\nsubstantial assets in the PRC). Securities\nlisted on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into\ntwo classes: A-shares, which are mostly\nlimited to domestic investors, and B-shares,\nwhich are allocated for both international and\ndomestic investors. The A-shares market is\ngenerally subject to greater government\nrestrictions, including trading suspensions,\nwhich may lead to increased liquidity risks.\nThe B-shares market is generally smaller and\nless liquid and has a smaller issuer base than\nthe A-shares market, which may lead to\nsignificant price volatility. B-shares,\nH-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that\nalso issue A-shares may trade at significant\ndiscounts to their A-shares counterparts. The\nissuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese\ncompanies and the ability to obtain a \u201c back-\ndoor listing \u201d through Red-Chips or P-Chips is\nstill regarded by the Chinese authorities as\nan experiment in economic reform. \u201c Back-door\nlisting \u201d is a means by which a mainland\nChinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to\nobtain quick access to international listing\nand international capital. These share\nmechanisms are subject to the political and\neconomic policies in China. Market\ndevelopments, adverse investor perceptions,\nregulatory and government intervention\n(including the possibility of widespread\ntrading suspensions implemented by regulators)\nand other factors may make it difficult to\nacquire, dispose of or value Chinese\nsecurities, which would lead to adverse\neffects to the Fund. Risk of Investing in\nA-shares through Stock Connect. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in A-shares\nthrough the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect\nprogram ( \u201c Shanghai Connect \u201d ) or the\nShenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program ( \u201c\nShenzhen Connect, \u201d and together with Shanghai\nConnect, \u201c Stock Connect \u201d ). Stock Connect is\na securities trading and clearing program with\nan aim to achieve mutual stock market access\nbetween the PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect\nwas developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and\nClearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of\nShanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of\nShenzhen Connect), and China Securities\nDepository and Clearing Corporation Limited (\n\u201c CSDCC \u201d ). Under Stock Connect, the Fund\u2019s\ntrading of eligible A-shares listed on the SSE\nor the SZSE, as applicable, would be\neffectuated through its Hong Kong brokers.\nInvesting in A-shares through Stock Connect is\nsubject to trading, clearance, settlement and\nother procedures, which could pose risks to\nthe Fund. Although no individual investment\nquotas or licensing requirements apply to\ninvestors in Stock Connect, trading through\nStock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the\n\u201c Daily Quota \u201d ), which limits the maximum\nnet purchases under Stock Connect each day.\nThe Daily Quota does not belong to the Fund\nand is utilized on a first-come-first-serve\nbasis. As such, buy orders for A-shares would\nbe rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded\n(although the Fund will be permitted to sell\nA-shares regardless of the Daily Quota\nbalance). The Daily Quota may restrict the\nFund\u2019s ability to invest in A-shares through\nStock Connect on a timely basis, which could\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to effectively\npursue its investment strategy. The Daily\nQuota is also subject to change. A-shares\npurchased through Stock Connect generally may\nonly be sold or otherwise transferred through\nStock Connect and in accordance with\napplicable rules. In order to comply with\napplicable local market rules and to\nfacilitate orderly operations of the Fund,\nincluding the timely settlement of Stock\nConnect trades placed by or on behalf of the\nFund, BFA utilizes an operating model that\nwill only be used by iShares ETFs with\ninvestments in A-shares through Stock Connect.\nSuch operating model may reduce the risks of\ntrade failures; however, it will also allow\nStock Connect trades to be settled without\nprior verification by the Fund. Accordingly,\nthis operating model may subject the Fund to\nadditional risks, including an increased risk\nof inadvertently exceeding certain trade or\nother restrictions or limits placed on the\nFund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened\nrisk of erroneous trades, which may negatively\nimpact the Fund. While A-shares must be\ndesignated as eligible to be traded through\nStock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed\non the SSE, the \u201c SSE Securities, \u201d and such\neligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the \u201c\nSZSE Securities \u201d ), those A-shares may also\nlose such\n\n22\n\ndesignation, and if this occurs, such A-shares\nmay be sold but could no longer be purchased\nthrough Stock Connect. With respect to sell\norders through Stock Connect, the SEHK carries\nout pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has\nsufficient A-shares in its account before the\nmarket opens on the trading day. Accordingly,\nif there are insufficient A-shares in an\ninvestor\u2019s account before the market opens on\nthe trading day, the sell order will be\nrejected, which may adversely impact the\nFund\u2019s performance. In addition, Stock Connect\noperates only on days when both the Chinese\nand the Hong Kong markets are open for trading\nand when banking services are available in\nboth markets on the corresponding settlement\ndays. Therefore, an investment in A-shares\nthrough Stock Connect may subject the Fund to\nthe risk of price fluctuations on days when\nthe Chinese markets are open, but Stock\nConnect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE\nand SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading\nthrough Stock Connect under certain\ncircumstances. Where such a suspension of\ntrading is effected, the Fund\u2019s ability to\naccess A-shares through Stock Connect will be\nadversely affected. In addition, if one or\nboth of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are\nclosed on a U.S. trading day, the Fund may not\nbe able to acquire or dispose of A-shares\nthrough Stock Connect in a timely manner,\nwhich could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. The Fund\u2019s investments in\nA-shares through Stock Connect are held by its\ncustodian in accounts in the Central Clearing\nand Settlement System ( \u201c CCASS \u201d ) maintained\nby the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company\nLimited ( \u201c HKSCC \u201d ), which in turn holds the\nA-shares, as the nominee holder, through an\nomnibus securities account in its name\nregistered with the CSDCC. The precise nature\nand rights of the Fund as the beneficial owner\nof the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities\nthrough HKSCC as nominee is not well defined\nunder PRC law. There is a lack of a clear\ndefinition of, and distinction between, legal\nownership and beneficial ownership under PRC\nlaw, and there have been few cases involving a\nnominee account structure in the PRC courts.\nThe exact nature and methods of enforcement of\nthe rights and interests of the Fund under PRC\nlaw is also uncertain. In the unlikely event\nthat HKSCC becomes subject to winding up\nproceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that\nthe SSE Securities or SZSE Securities may not\nbe regarded as held for the beneficial\nownership of the Fund or as part of the\ngeneral assets of HKSCC available for general\ndistribution to its creditors. Notwithstanding\nthe fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary\ninterests in the SSE Securities or SZSE\nSecurities held in its omnibus stock account\nin the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar\nfor SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still\ntreat HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it\nhandles corporate actions in respect of such\nSSE Securities or SZSE Securities. HKSCC\nmonitors the corporate actions affecting SSE\nSecurities and SZSE Securities and keeps\nparticipants of CCASS informed of all such\ncorporate actions that require CCASS\nparticipants to take steps in order to\nparticipate in them. The Fund will therefore\ndepend on HKSCC for both settlement and\nnotification and implementation of corporate\nactions. The HKSCC is responsible for the\nclearing, settlement and provision of\ndepositary, nominee and other related services\nof the trades executed by Hong Kong market\nparticipants and investors. Accordingly,\ninvestors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE\nSecurities directly; rather, they are held\nthrough their brokers\u2019 or custodians\u2019 accounts\nwith CCASS. The HKSCC and the CSDCC establish\nclearing links and each has become a\nparticipant of the other to facilitate\nclearing and settlement of cross-border\ntrades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be\ndeclared as a defaulter, HKSCC\u2019s liabilities\nin Stock Connect under its market contracts\nwith clearing participants will be limited to\nassisting clearing participants in pursuing\ntheir claims against the CSDCC. In that event,\nthe Fund may suffer delays in the recovery\nprocess or may not be able to fully recover\nits losses from the CSDCC. Market participants\nare able to participate in Stock Connect\nsubject to meeting certain information\ntechnology capability, risk management and\nother requirements as may be specified by the\nrelevant exchange and/or clearing house.\nFurther, the \u201c connectivity \u201d in Stock Connect\nrequires the routing of orders across the\nborders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This\nrequires the development of new information\ntechnology systems on the part of the SEHK and\nexchange participants. There is no assurance\nthat these systems will function properly or\nwill continue to be adapted to changes and\ndevelopments in both markets. In the event\nthat the relevant systems fail to function\nproperly, trading in A-shares through Stock\nConnect could be disrupted, and the Fund\u2019s\nability to achieve its investment objective\nmay be adversely affected. The Shanghai\nConnect program, launched in November 2014,\nand the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in\nDecember 2016, do not have an extensive\noperating history. Stock Connect is subject to\nregulations promulgated by regulatory\nauthorities and implementation rules made by\nthe stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong.\nThere is no certainty as to how the current\nregulations will be applied or interpreted\ngoing forward, and new or revised regulations\nmay be issued from time to time by the\nregulators and stock exchanges in China and\nHong Kong in connection with operations, legal\nenforcement and cross-border trades under\nStock Connect. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that Stock Connect will\n\n23\n\nnot be discontinued. The Fund may be adversely\naffected as a result of such changes.\nFurthermore, the securities regimes and legal\nsystems of China and Hong Kong differ\nsignificantly and issues may arise based on\nthese differences. Further, different fees,\ncosts and taxes are imposed on foreign\ninvestors acquiring A-shares through Stock\nConnect, and these fees, costs and taxes may\nbe higher than comparable fees, costs and\ntaxes imposed on owners of other Chinese\nsecurities providing similar investment\nexposure. A-Share Market Suspension Risk.\nA-shares may only be bought from, or sold to,\nthe Fund at times when the relevant A-shares\nmay be sold or purchased on the relevant\nChinese stock exchange. The A-shares market\ncan have a higher propensity for trading\nsuspensions than many other global equity\nmarkets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks\ncould lead to greater market execution risk,\nvaluation risks and liquidity risks and costs\nfor the Fund, as well as for Authorized\nParticipants that create and redeem Creation\nUnits of the Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently\napply a daily limit, set at 10%, of the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in the prices of\nA-shares during a single trading day. The\ndaily limit refers to price movements only and\ndoes not restrict trading within the relevant\nlimit. There can be no assurance that a liquid\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular A-share or for any particular time.\nThis could increase an Underlying Fund\u2019s\ntracking error and/or cause the Fund to trade\nin the market at greater bid-ask spreads or\ngreater premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Given that the A-shares market is\nconsidered volatile and unstable (with the\nrisk of widespread trading suspensions or\ngovernment intervention), the creation and\nredemption of Creation Units may also be\ndisrupted. Risk of Investing in Developed\nCountries. Many countries with developed\nmarkets have recently experienced significant\neconomic pressures. These countries generally\ntend to rely on the services sectors ( e.g. ,\nthe financial services sector) as the primary\nsource of economic growth and may be\nsusceptible to the risks of individual service\nsectors. For example, companies in the\nfinancial services sector are subject to\ngovernmental regulation and, recently,\ngovernment intervention, which may adversely\naffect the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and amount of capital\nthey must maintain. Dislocations in the\nfinancial sector and perceived or actual\ngovernmental influence over certain financial\ncompanies may lead to credit rating downgrades\nand, as a result, impact, among other things,\nrevenue growth for such companies. If\nfinancial companies experience a prolonged\ndecline in revenue growth, certain developed\ncountries that rely heavily on financial\ncompanies as an economic driver may experience\na correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged\nwith respect to the economic health of certain\ndeveloped countries. These concerns primarily\nstem from heavy indebtedness of many developed\ncountries and their perceived inability to\ncontinue to service high debt loads without\nsimultaneously implementing stringent\nausterity measures. Such concerns have led to\ntremendous downward pressure on the economies\nof these countries. As a result, it is\npossible that interest rates on debt of\ncertain developed countries may rise to levels\nthat make it difficult for such countries to\nservice such debt. Spending on health care and\nretirement pensions in most developed\ncountries has risen dramatically. Medical\ninnovation, extended life expectancy and\nhigher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Risk of Investing in Eastern\nEurope. Investing in the securities of issuers\nlocated or operating in Eastern Europe is\nhighly speculative and involves risks not\nusually associated with investing in the more\ndeveloped markets of Western Europe. Certain\nEastern European countries have high public\ndebt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an inefficient public\nsector prone to endemic corruption. Political\nand economic reforms are too recent to\nestablish a definite trend away from centrally\nplanned economies and state-owned industries.\nIn the past, some Eastern European governments\nhave expropriated substantial amounts of\nprivate property, and many claims of the\nproperty owners have never been fully settled.\nMany Eastern European countries continue to\nmove toward market economies at different\npaces with different characteristics. Many\nEastern European securities markets are\ngenerally underdeveloped with low, irregular\ntrading volumes, dubious investor protections,\nand often a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are\n\n24\n\ngenerally subject to less government\nsupervision and regulation and may be less\nliquid and more volatile than securities\nmarkets in the U.S. or Western European\ncountries. Legal institutions governing\nprivate and foreign investments and private\nproperty may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Information and transaction\ncosts, differential taxes, and sometimes\npolitical or transfer risk give a comparative\nadvantage to the domestic investor rather than\nthe foreign investor. Eastern European\neconomies may also be particularly susceptible\nto changes in the international credit markets\ndue to their reliance on bank related inflows\nof capital. Changes to the economies of\ncountries with substantial foreign direct\ninvestment in certain Eastern European\ncountries may negatively affect the region\u2019s\neconomy. The economy of certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may be adversely affected\nby global prices for manufactured goods or\ncommodity price declines to the extent that a\ncountry relies on the export of such products.\nGeopolitical events, including war, and other\ninstability in certain Eastern European\ncountries may cause uncertainty in the\nregion\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund has exposure.\nThese markets may be particularly sensitive to\nsocial, political, economic, and currency\nevents in Russia and may suffer heavy losses\nas a result of their trading and investment\nlinks to the Russian economy and currency.\nRussia has historically asserted its influence\nin the region using diplomatic, informational,\nmilitary, and economic instruments of national\npower, as it did with Georgia in the summer of\n2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014, and most\nrecently on February 24, 2022. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund invests, or\nthe economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Risk of Investing in Emerging\nMarkets. Investments in emerging market\ncountries may be subject to greater risks than\ninvestments in developed countries. These\nrisks include: (i) less social, political, and\neconomic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity\nand price volatility due to smaller or limited\nlocal capital markets for such securities, or\nlow or non-existent trading volumes; (iii)\ncompanies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign\nexchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to\nless scrutiny and regulation by local\nauthorities; (iv) local governments may decide\nto seize or confiscate securities held by\nforeign investors and/or local governments may\ndecide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability\nto make dividend or interest payments; (v)\nlocal governments may limit or entirely\nrestrict repatriation of invested capital,\nprofits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may\nbe subject to local taxation, including on a\nretroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing\nrestrictions on standard payments imposed by\nlocal governments may attempt to make dividend\nor interest payments to foreign investors in\nthe local currency; (viii) there may be\nsignificant obstacles to obtaining information\nnecessary for investigations into or\nlitigation against companies and investors may\nexperience difficulty in enforcing legal\nclaims related to the securities and/or local\njudges may favor the interests of the issuer\nover those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy\njudgments may only be permitted to be paid in\nthe local currency; (x) limited public\ninformation regarding the issuer may result in\ngreater difficulty in determining market\nvaluations of the securities; and (xi) lack of\nfinancial reporting on a regular basis,\nsubstandard disclosure and differences in\naccounting standards may make it difficult to\nascertain the financial health of an issuer.\nThe Underlying Funds are not actively managed\nand do not select investments based on\ninvestor protection considerations. Emerging\nmarket securities markets are typically marked\nby a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of ownership of such securities\nby a limited number of investors. In addition,\nbrokerage and other costs associated with\ntransactions in emerging market securities can\nbe higher, sometimes significantly, than\nsimilar costs incurred in securities markets\nin developed countries. Although some emerging\nmarkets have become more established and tend\nto issue securities of higher\n\n25\n\ncredit quality, the markets for securities in\nother emerging market countries are in the\nearliest stages of their development, and\nthese countries issue securities across the\ncredit spectrum. Even the markets for\nrelatively widely traded securities in\nemerging market countries may not be able to\nabsorb, without price disruptions, a\nsignificant increase in trading volume or\ntrades of a size customarily undertaken by\ninstitutional investors in the securities\nmarkets of developed countries. The limited\nsize of many of these securities markets can\ncause prices to be erratic for reasons apart\nfrom factors that affect the soundness and\ncompetitiveness of the securities issuers. For\nexample, prices may be unduly influenced by\ntraders who control large positions in these\nmarkets. Additionally, market making and\narbitrage activities are generally less\nextensive in such markets, which may\ncontribute to increased volatility and reduced\nliquidity of such markets. The limited\nliquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect an Underlying\nFund's ability to accurately value its\nportfolio securities or to acquire or dispose\nof securities at the price and time it wishes\nto do so or in order to meet redemption\nrequests. Many emerging market countries\nsuffer from uncertainty and corruption in\ntheir legal frameworks. Legislation may be\ndifficult to interpret and laws may be too new\nto provide any precedential value. Laws\nregarding foreign investment and private\nproperty may be weak or non-existent. Sudden\nchanges in governments may result in policies\nwhich are less favorable to investors such as\npolicies designed to expropriate or\nnationalize \u201c sovereign \u201d assets. Certain\nemerging market countries in the past have\nexpropriated large amounts of private\nproperty, in many cases with little or no\ncompensation, and there can be no assurance\nthat such expropriation will not occur in the\nfuture. Investment in the securities markets\nof certain emerging market countries is\nrestricted or controlled to varying degrees.\nThese restrictions may limit an Underlying\nFund's investment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nUnderlying Fund. Certain emerging market\ncountries require governmental approval prior\nto investments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. An Underlying\nFund's income and, in some cases, capital\ngains from foreign securities will be subject\nto applicable taxation in certain of the\nemerging market countries in which it invests,\nand treaties between the U.S. and such\ncountries may not be available in some cases\nto reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.\nEmerging markets also have different clearance\nand settlement procedures, and in certain of\nthese emerging markets there have been times\nwhen settlements have been unable to keep pace\nwith the volume of securities transactions,\nmaking it difficult to conduct such\ntransactions. In the past, certain governments\nin emerging market countries have become\noverly reliant on the international capital\nmarkets and other forms of foreign credit to\nfinance large public spending programs, which\nin the past have caused huge budget deficits.\nOften, interest payments have become too\noverwhelming for a government to meet,\nrepresenting a large percentage of total GDP.\nThese foreign obligations have become the\nsubject of political debate and served as fuel\nfor political parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes an Underlying Fund\nto the economic and political risks associated\nwith Europe in general and the specific\nEuropean countries in which it invests. The\neconomies and markets of European countries\nare often closely connected and\ninterdependent, and events in one European\ncountry can have an adverse impact on other\nEuropean countries. An Underlying Fund makes\ninvestments in securities of issuers that are\ndomiciled in, have significant operations in,\nor that are listed on at least one securities\nexchange within member states of the European\nUnion (the \u201c EU \u201d ). A number of countries\nwithin the EU are also members of the Economic\nand Monetary Union\n\n26\n\n(the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the euro\nas their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone. Consequently, these countries must\ncomply with many of the restrictions noted\nabove. The European financial markets have\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns,\ngovernment debt levels and the possible\ndefault of government debt in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nIn order to prevent further economic\ndeterioration, certain countries, without\nprior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect an Underlying\nFund\u2019s investments. A default or debt\nrestructuring by any European country would\nadversely impact holders of that country\u2019s\ndebt and sellers of credit default swaps\nlinked to that country\u2019s creditworthiness,\nwhich may be located in countries other than\nthose listed above. In addition, the credit\nratings of certain European countries were\ndowngraded in the past. These events have\nadversely affected the value and exchange rate\nof the euro and may continue to significantly\naffect the economies of every country in\nEurope, including countries that do not use\nthe euro and non-EU member states. Responses\nto the financial problems by European\ngovernments, central banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and reforms, may\nnot produce the desired results, may result in\nsocial unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The\nimpact of these actions, especially if they\noccur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear\nbut could be significant and far-reaching and\ncould adversely impact the value of an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s investments in the region.\nThe United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU\n( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit\ncould adversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of the Fund's or Underlying\nFund's investments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including declines in its\nstock markets and the value of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be significant. Disruptions\ncaused by Russian military action or other\nactions (including cyberattacks and espionage)\nor resulting actual and threatened responses\nto such activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Risk of Investing in India. India is\nan emerging market and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to more developed markets.\nPolitical, religious, and border disputes\npersist in India. India has recently\nexperienced and may continue to experience\ncivil unrest and hostilities with certain of\nits neighboring countries, including Pakistan,\nand the Indian government has confronted\nseparatist movements in several Indian states,\nincluding Kashmir and\n\n27\n\nPunjab. Government control over the economy,\ncurrency fluctuations or blockage, and the\nrisk of nationalization or expropriation of\nassets offer higher potential for losses.\nGovernmental actions could have a negative\neffect on the economic conditions in India,\nwhich could adversely affect the value and\nliquidity of investments made by an Underlying\nFund. The securities markets in India are\ncomparatively underdeveloped and with some\nexceptions, consist of a small number of\nlisted companies with small market\ncapitalization, greater price volatility and\nsubstantially less liquidity than companies in\nmore developed markets. Stockbrokers and other\nintermediaries in India may not perform as\nwell as their counterparts in the U.S. or\nother, more developed countries. The limited\nliquidity of the Indian securities markets may\nalso affect an Underlying Fund\u2019s ability to\nacquire or dispose of securities at the price\nor time that it desires or an Underlying\nFund\u2019s ability to track its underlying index.\nGlobal factors and foreign actions may inhibit\nthe flow of foreign capital on which India is\ndependent to sustain its growth. In addition,\nthe Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits\non foreign ownership of Indian companies,\nwhich may decrease the liquidity of an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s portfolio and result in\nextreme volatility in the prices of Indian\nsecurities. In November 2016, the Indian\ngovernment eliminated certain large\ndenomination cash notes as legal tender,\ncausing uncertainty in certain financial\nmarkets. These factors, coupled with the lack\nof extensive accounting, auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards and practices,\nas applicable in the U.S., may increase the\nrisk of loss for a Fund. Securities laws in\nIndia are relatively new and unsettled and, as\na result, there is a risk of significant and\nunpredictable change in laws governing foreign\ninvestment, securities regulation, title to\nsecurities and shareholder rights. Foreign\ninvestors in particular may be adversely\naffected by new or amended laws and\nregulations. Certain Indian regulatory\napprovals, including approvals from the\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India ( \u201c\nSEBI \u201d ), the central government and the tax\nauthorities (to the extent that tax benefits\nneed to be utilized), may be required before\nan Underlying Fund can make investments in\nIndian companies. Capital gains from Indian\nsecurities may be subject to local taxation.\nTechnology and software sectors represent a\nsignificant portion of the total\ncapitalization of the Indian securities\nmarkets. The value of these companies will\ngenerally fluctuate in response to\ntechnological and regulatory developments,\nand, as a result, an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nholdings are expected to experience correlated\nfluctuations. Natural disasters, such as\ntsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in\nIndia or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Indian economy or\noperations of a Subsidiary, and, in turn,\ncould negatively affect a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in Japan. Japan may be subject to\npolitical, economic, labor and other risks.\nAny of these risks, individually or in the\naggregate, can impact an investment made in\nJapan. Currency Risk . The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times and any increase in\nits value may cause a decline in exports that\ncould weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Economic Risk\n. The growth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy. Geographic Risk . Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy, and,\nin turn, could negatively affect the Fund.\nLabor Risk . Japan has an aging workforce and\nhas experienced a significant population\ndecline in recent years. Japan\u2019s labor market\nappears to be undergoing fundamental\nstructural changes, as a labor market\ntraditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan\u2019s economic competitiveness. Large\nGovernment and Corporate Debt Risk . The\nJapanese economy faces several concerns,\nincluding a financial system with large levels\nof nonperforming loans, over-leveraged\ncorporate balance sheets, extensive cross-\nownership by major\n\n28\n\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect an Underlying\nFund\u2019s investments. In addition, China has\nbecome an important trading partner with\nJapan. Japan\u2019s political relationship with\nChina, however, has been strained. Should\npolitical tension increase, it could adversely\naffect the Japanese economy and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Risk of Investing in\nthe Middle East. Many Middle Eastern countries\nhave little or no democratic tradition, and\nthe political and legal systems in such\ncountries may have an adverse impact on the\nFund or an Underlying Fund. Many economies in\nthe Middle East are highly reliant on income\nfrom the sale of oil and natural gas or trade\nwith countries involved in the sale of oil and\nnatural gas, and their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the market for oil\nand natural gas and foreign currency values.\nAs global demand for oil and natural gas\nfluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may\nbe significantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund or an Underlying Fund,\nas well as the value of securities in such\nUnderlying Funds' portfolios. Certain Middle\nEastern markets are in the earliest stages of\ndevelopment. As a result, there may be a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of investors\nand financial intermediaries. Brokers in\nMiddle Eastern countries typically are fewer\nin number and less capitalized than brokers in\nthe U.S. The legal systems in certain Middle\nEastern countries also may have an adverse\nimpact on an Underlying Fund. For example, the\npotential liability of a shareholder in a U.S.\ncorporation with respect to acts of the\ncorporation generally is limited to the amount\nof the shareholder\u2019s investment. However, the\nnotion of limited liability is less clear in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries. Certain\nUnderlying Funds therefore may be liable in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries for the acts\nof a corporation in which it invests for an\namount greater than their actual investment in\nthat corporation. Similarly, the rights of\ninvestors in Middle Eastern issuers may be\nmore limited than those of shareholders of a\nU.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as an\nUnderlying Fund. For example, certain\ncountries may require governmental approval\nprior to investment by foreign persons or\nlimit the amount of investment by foreign\npersons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle\nEastern countries may also limit investment by\nforeign persons to only a specific class of\nsecurities of an issuer that may have less\nadvantageous terms (including price) than\nsecurities of the issuer available for\npurchase by nationals of the relevant Middle\nEastern country. The manner in which foreign\ninvestors may invest in companies in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries, as well as\nlimitations on those investments, may have an\nadverse impact on the operations of an\nUnderlying Fund. For example, in certain of\nthese countries, an Underlying Fund may be\nrequired to invest initially through a local\nbroker or other entity and then have the\nshares that were purchased re-registered in\nthe name of the Underlying Funds. Re-\nregistration in some instances may not be\npossible on a timely basis. This may result in\na delay during which an Underlying Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where an Underlying Fund\nplaces a purchase order but is subsequently\ninformed, at the time of re-registration, that\nthe permissible allocation of the investment\nto foreign investors has already been filled\nand, consequently, an Underlying Fund may not\nbe able to invest in the relevant company.\nSubstantial limitations may exist in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries with respect to an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate\ninvestment income or capital gains. An\nUnderlying Fund could be adversely affected by\ndelays in, or a refusal to grant, any required\ngovernmental approval for repatriation of\ncapital, as well as by the application to an\nUnderlying Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\n\n29\n\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests may operate in, or\nhave dealings with, countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations, and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. An\nUnderlying Fund, as an investor in such\nissuers, will be indirectly subject to those\nrisks. Certain Middle Eastern countries have\nstrained relations with other Middle Eastern\ncountries due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, international\nalliances, defense concerns or other reasons,\nwhich may adversely affect the economies of\nthese Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle\nEastern countries experience significant\nunemployment, as well as widespread\nunderemployment. There has also been a recent\nincrease in recruitment efforts and an\naggressive push for territorial control by\nterrorist groups in the region, which has led\nto an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in Russia. Investing in the Russian\nsecurities market involves a high degree of\nrisk and special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities market, and should be considered\nhighly speculative. Risks include: the absence\nof developed legal structures governing\nprivate and foreign investments and private\nproperty; the possibility of the loss of all\nor a substantial portion of an Underlying\nFund\u2019s assets invested in Russia as a result\nof expropriation; certain national policies\nwhich may restrict the Underlying Fund\u2019s\ninvestment opportunities, including, without\nlimitation, restrictions on investing in\nissuers or industries deemed sensitive to\nrelevant national interests; and potentially\ngreater price volatility in, significantly\nsmaller capitalization of, and relative\nilliquidity of, the Russian market. There can\nalso be no assurance that an Underlying Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in the Russian securities market\nwould not be expropriated, nationalized or\notherwise confiscated. In the event of the\nsettlement of any such claims or such\nexpropriation, nationalization or other\nconfiscation, an Underlying Fund could lose\nits entire investment. In addition, it may be\ndifficult and more costly to obtain and\nenforce a judgment in the Russian court\nsystem. Russia may also be subject to a\ngreater degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability than is the case in other\ndeveloped countries. Such instability may\nresult from, among other things, the\nfollowing: (i) an authoritarian government or\nmilitary involvement in political and economic\ndecision-making, including changes in\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means;\n(ii) popular unrest associated with demands\nfor improved political, economic and social\nconditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv)\nhostile relations, including armed conflict,\nwith neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic,\nreligious and racial disaffection. The Russian\neconomy is heavily dependent upon the export\nof a range of commodities including most\nindustrial metals, forestry products and oil\nand gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected\nby international commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. As Russia produces and\nexports large amounts of crude oil and gas,\nany acts of terrorism or armed conflict\ncausing disruptions of Russian oil and gas\nexports could negatively affect the Russian\neconomy and, thus, adversely affect the\nfinancial condition, results of operations or\nprospects of related companies. Current and\nfuture economic sanctions may also adversely\naffect the Russian oil, banking, mining,\nmetals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among\nother sectors. The Russian government may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in Russia, which could\nhave a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in Russia. In recent years,\nthe Russian government has begun to take\nbolder steps to re-assert its regional\ngeopolitical influence (including military\nsteps) and launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. Additionally,\nRussia is alleged to have participated in\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Such steps\nhave increased tensions between Russia and its\nneighbors and Western countries and may\nnegatively affect economic growth. Actual and\nthreatened responses by other nation-states to\nRussia\u2019s alleged cyber activity may have an\nadverse impact on the Russian economy and the\nRussian issuers of securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. For example, the U.S.\nhas added certain foreign technology companies\nto the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau\n\n30\n\nof Industry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d\nwhich is a list of companies believed to pose\na national security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Russian economy.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions . Governments in\nthe U.S. and many other countries\n(collectively, the \u201c Sanctioning Bodies \u201d )\nhave imposed economic sanctions on certain\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nand Russian corporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from global payments\nsystems that facilitate cross-border payments.\nThe Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell,\nreceive or deliver those securities and/or\nassets. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. The sanctions\nagainst certain Russian issuers include\nprohibitions on transacting in or dealing in\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers.\nCompliance with each of these sanctions has\nand may continue to impair the ability of an\nUnderlying Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or\ndeliver the affected securities or other\nsecurities of such issuers. If it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for an Underlying\nFund to hold securities subject to, or\notherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, an Underlying\nFund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the\naffected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s transaction costs. An\nUnderlying Fund may also be legally required\nto freeze assets in a blocked account.\nSanctions have resulted in Russia taking\ncounter measures or retaliatory actions, which\nhas impaired the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities. These retaliatory measures\ninclude the immediate freeze of Russian assets\nheld by an Underlying Fund. Due to such a\nfreeze of these assets, including depositary\nreceipts, an Underlying Fund may need to\nliquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in an Underlying Fund\nreceiving substantially lower prices for its\nsecurities. Russia may implement additional\nretaliatory measures, which may further impair\nthe value and liquidity of Russian securities\nand the ability of the Fund to receive\ndividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies ( e.g. ,\ndividends), and prohibits Russian persons from\nentering into transactions with designated\npersons from \u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as\nthe export of raw materials or other products\nfrom Russia to certain sanctioned persons.\nRussian companies may be unable to pay\ndividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund\nmay be unable to receive them. These\nsanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend\ntrading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and\nprohibit non-resident investors from executing\nsecurity sales, and other events have led to\nchanges in certain of the underlying index of\nthe Underlying Funds. The Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex Providers have removed Russian\nsecurities where present in an underlying\nindex of an Underlying Fund. To the extent\nthat an Underlying Fund rebalances its\nportfolio and trades in non-Russian securities\nto seek to track the investment results of its\nunderlying index, this may result in\ntransaction costs and increased tracking\nerror. The Underlying Funds are currently\nrestricted from trading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in their portfolios, while an\nUnderlying Fund's underlying index has removed\nRussian securities. For Underlying Funds with\nRussian securities, this disparity will also\nlead to increased tracking error. The\ninability of an Underlying Fund to trade in\nRussian securities may adversely affect an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. It is unknown when, or\nif, sanctions may be lifted or an Underlying\nFund\u2019s ability to trade in Russian securities\nwill resume.\n\n31\n\nAlso, if an affected security is included in\nan Underlying Fund\u2019s underlying index, an\nUnderlying Fund may, where practicable, seek\nto eliminate its holdings of the affected\nsecurity by employing or augmenting its\nrepresentative sampling strategy to seek to\ntrack the investment results of its underlying\nindex. The use of (or increased use of) a\nrepresentative sampling strategy may increase\nan Underlying Fund\u2019s tracking error risk. If\nthe affected securities constitute a\nsignificant percentage of its underlying\nindex, an Underlying Fund may not be able to\neffectively implement a representative\nsampling strategy, which may result in\nsignificant tracking error between an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its underlying index. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The ability of\nforeign investors (such as the Fund) to invest\nin the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is\nrelatively new. Such ability could be\nrestricted by the Saudi Arabian government at\nany time, and unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to foreign ownership\nin such securities. In addition, the Capital\nMarket Authority ( \u201c CMA \u201d ) places investment\nlimitations on the ownership of the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors,\nincluding a limitation on an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nownership of the securities of any single\nissuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock\nExchange, which may prevent an Underlying Fund\nfrom investing in accordance with its\nstrategy. These restrictions may be changed or\nnew restrictions, such as licensing\nrequirements, special approvals or additional\nforeign taxes, may be instituted at any time.\nA Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain\nany such licenses or approvals and may not be\nable to buy and sell securities at full value.\nMajor disruptions or regulatory changes could\noccur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of\nwhich could negatively impact an Underlying\nFund. These risks may be exacerbated, compared\nto more developed markets, given the limited\nhistory of foreign investment in the Saudi\nArabian market. Investments in Saudi Arabia\nmay also be subject to loss due to\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nadditional foreign investments and\nrepatriation of capital. Such heightened risks\nmay include, among others, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand an Underlying Fund\u2019s investments.\nGovernmental actions in the future could have\na significant effect on economic conditions in\nSaudi Arabia, which could affect private\nsector companies and an Underlying Fund, as\nwell as the value of securities in an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any economic\nsanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or\nSaudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the\nthreat of sanctions, may result in the decline\nof the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian\nsecurities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or\nother adverse consequences to the Saudi\nArabian economy. Any sanctions could also\nresult in the immediate freeze of Saudi\nArabian securities and/or funds investing in\nprohibited assets, impairing the ability of an\nUnderlying Fund to buy, sell, receive or\ndeliver those securities and/or assets. In\naddition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies\nheavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes\nin the availability of this labor supply could\nhave an adverse effect on the economy. The\nsecurities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be\nas developed as those in other countries. As a\nresult, securities markets in Saudi Arabia are\nsubject to greater risks associated with\nmarket volatility, lower market\ncapitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\n\n32\n\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and an Underlying Fund\u2019s ability to\nsell these securities in the future. Although\nthe political situation in Saudi Arabia is\nlargely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which an Underlying Fund\nhas exposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in an Underlying\nFund\u2019s portfolio. Certain issuers located in\nSaudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings\nwith, countries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. An Underlying\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Risk of\nInvesting in Taiwan. Investment in Taiwanese\nissuers will subject the Fund or an Underlying\nFund to loss in the event of adverse\npolitical, economic, regulatory and other\ndevelopments that affect Taiwan, including\nfluctuations of the New Taiwan dollar versus\nthe U.S. dollar. Taiwan has few natural\nresources. Any fluctuation or shortage in the\ncommodity markets could have a negative impact\non the Taiwanese economy. Appreciation of the\nNew Taiwan dollar, rising labor costs, and\nincreasing environmental consciousness have\nled some labor-intensive industries to\nrelocate to other countries with cheaper work\nforces. Continued labor outsourcing may\nadversely affect the Taiwanese economy.\nTaiwanese firms are among the world\u2019s largest\nsuppliers of computer monitors and leaders in\npersonal computer manufacturing. A slowdown in\nglobal demand for these products will likely\nhave an adverse impact on the Taiwanese\neconomy. The Chinese government views Taiwan\nas a renegade province and continues to\ncontest Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. The outbreak of\nhostilities between the two nations, or even\nthe threat of an outbreak of hostilities, will\nlikely adversely impact the Taiwanese economy.\nSuch risks, among others, may adversely affect\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's investments. Risk of Investing in the\nCommunication Services Sector. The\ncommunication services sector consists of both\ncompanies in the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the media and\nentertainment industry. Examples of companies\nin the telecommunication services industry\ngroup include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-\nline, cellular and wireless telecommunications\nnetworks. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industry group encompass a\nvariety of services and products including\ntelevision broadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking platforms, online\nclassifieds, online review websites, and\nInternet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the\n\n33\n\ncommunication services sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ncommunications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nstaples sector may also be affected by changes\nin global economic, environmental and\npolitical events, economic conditions, the\ndepletion of resources, and government\nregulation. For instance, government\nregulations may affect the permissibility of\nusing various food additives and production\nmethods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability. In\naddition, tobacco companies may be adversely\naffected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector also may be\nsubject to risks pertaining to the supply of,\ndemand for and prices of raw materials. The\nprices of raw materials fluctuate in response\nto a number of factors, including, without\nlimitation, changes in government agricultural\nsupport programs, exchange rates, import and\nexport controls, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in an Underlying\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, an\nUnderlying Fund could lose all or a\nsubstantial portion of its investment. The\nenergy sector is cyclical and is highly\ndependent on commodity prices. Prices and\nsupplies of energy may fluctuate significantly\nover short and long periods of time due to,\namong other things, national and international\npolitical changes, Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d ) policies,\nchanges in relationships among OPEC members\nand between OPEC and oil-importing nations,\nthe regulatory environment, taxation policies,\nthe enactment or cessation of trade sanctions,\nwar or other geopolitical\n\n34\n\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of an Underlying Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in the Financials Sector. Companies\nin the financials sector include small,\nregional and money center banks, securities\nbrokerage firms, asset management companies,\nsavings banks and thrift institutions,\nspecialty finance companies ( e.g. , credit\ncard, mortgage providers), insurance and\ninsurance brokerage firms, consumer finance\nfirms, financial conglomerates and foreign\nbanking and financial companies. Most\nfinancial companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which an Underlying\nFund invests, including legislation in many\ncountries that may increase government\nregulation, repatriation and other\nintervention. The impact of governmental\nintervention and legislative changes on any\nindividual financial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are\n\n35\n\nexposed directly to the credit risk of their\nborrowers and counterparties, who may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree, including\nthrough swaps and other derivatives products,\nand who at times may be unable to meet their\nobligations to the financial services\ncompanies. Financial services companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties, with the result\nthat a borrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability\nto meet its obligations to one company may\naffect other companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay\n\n36\n\naffect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace\nand defense companies, a component of the\nindustrials sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on government\ndemand for their products and services. Thus,\nthe financial condition of, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace and defense companies\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense\nspending policies, which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control government\nbudgets. Transportation stocks, a component of\nthe industrials sector, are cyclical and can\nbe significantly affected by economic changes,\nfuel prices, labor relations and insurance\ncosts. Transportation companies in certain\ncountries may also be subject to significant\ngovernment regulation and oversight, which may\nadversely affect their businesses. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Information\nTechnology Sector. Information technology\ncompanies face intense competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, which may\nhave an adverse effect on profit margins. Like\nother technology companies, information\ntechnology companies may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of information\ntechnology companies may face product\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction, unpredictable changes in growth\nrates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Companies in the information\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Information technology companies\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. Finally,\nwhile all companies may be susceptible to\nnetwork security breaches, certain companies\nin the information technology sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThese risks are heightened for information\ntechnology companies in foreign markets. Risk\nof Investing in the Infrastructure Industry.\nCompanies in the infrastructure industry may\nbe subject to a variety of factors that could\nadversely affect their business or operations,\nincluding high interest costs in connection\nwith capital construction programs, high\ndegrees of leverage, costs associated with\ngovernmental, environmental and other\nregulations, the effects of economic\nslowdowns, increased competition from other\nproviders of services, uncertainties\nconcerning costs, the level of government\nspending on infrastructure projects, and other\nfactors. Infrastructure companies may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, changes in exchange rates, import\ncontrols, depletion of resources,\ntechnological developments, and labor\nrelations. There is also the risk that\ncorruption may negatively affect publicly\nfunded infrastructure projects, especially in\nemerging markets, resulting in delays and cost\noverruns. Infrastructure issuers can be\nsignificantly affected by government spending\npolicies because companies involved in this\nindustry rely to a significant extent on U.S.\nand other government demand for their\nproducts. Infrastructure companies in the oil\nand gas industry may be adversely affected by\ngovernment regulation or world events in the\nregions where the companies operate ( e.g. ,\nexpropriation, nationalization, confiscation\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and\nrepatriation of capital, military coups,\nsocial unrest, violence or labor unrest).\nInfrastructure companies may have significant\ncapital investments in, or engage in\ntransactions involving, emerging market\ncountries, which may heighten these risks.\nOperations Risk. The failure of an\ninfrastructure company to carry adequate\ninsurance or to operate its assets\nappropriately could lead to significant\nlosses. Infrastructure may be adversely\naffected by environmental clean-up costs and\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts. Customer Risk.\nInfrastructure companies can be dependent upon\na narrow customer base. Additionally, if these\ncustomers fail to pay their obligations,\nsignificant revenues could be lost and may not\nbe replaceable. Regulatory Risk.\nInfrastructure companies may be subject to\nsignificant regulation by various governmental\nauthorities and also may be affected by\nregulation of rates charged to customers,\nservice interruption due to environmental,\noperational or other events, the imposition of\nspecial tariffs and changes in tax laws,\nregulatory policies and accounting standards.\nStrategic Asset Risk. Infrastructure companies\nmay control significant strategic assets (\ne.g. , major pipelines or highways), which are\nassets that have a national or regional\nprofile, and may have monopolistic\ncharacteristics. Given their national or\n\n37\n\nregional profile or irreplaceable nature,\nstrategic assets could generate additional\nrisk not common in other industry sectors and\nthey may be targeted for terrorist acts or\nadverse political actions. Interest Rate Risk.\nRising interest rates could result in higher\ncosts of capital for infrastructure companies,\nwhich could negatively impact their ability to\nmeet payment obligations. Leverage Risk.\nInfrastructure companies can be highly\nleveraged, which increases investments risk\nand other risks normally associated with debt\nfinancing and could adversely affect an\ninfrastructure company's operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nInflation Risk. Many infrastructure companies\nmay have fixed income streams. Consequently,\ntheir market values may decline in times of\nhigher inflation. Additionally, the prices\nthat an infrastructure company is able to\ncharge users of its assets may be linked to\ninflation, whether by government regulation,\ncontractual arrangement or other factors. In\nthis case, changes in the rate of inflation\nmay affect the company's profitability.\nTransportation Risk. The stock prices of\ncompanies in the transportation industry group\nare affected by both supply and demand for\ntheir specific product. Government regulation,\nworld events and economic conditions may\naffect the performance of companies in the\ntransportation industry group. Oil and Gas\nRisk. The profitability of oil and gas\ncompanies is related to worldwide energy\nprices, exploration, and production spending.\nUtilities Risk. Utilities companies face\nintense competition, both domestically and\ninternationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on their profit margins. The rates\ncharged by regulated utility companies are\nsubject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Risk of\nInvesting in the Materials Sector. Companies\nin the materials sector may be adversely\naffected by commodity price volatility,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price,\n\n38\n\nresulting in abrupt or erratic price\nfluctuations. In addition, real estate is\nrelatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in CMBS may\nalso be junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\n\n39\n\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, an Underlying Fund may at times need to\nrequest permission to extend the deadline for\nissuing your tax reporting statement or\nsupplement the information otherwise provided\nto you. Risk of Investing in Technology\nCompanies. Technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technological advances\nmay have limited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources and personnel. These\ncompanies may face rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and costs related\nto new product introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Risk of Investing in\nthe Utilities Sector. The utilities sector may\nbe adversely affected by changing commodity\nprices, government regulation stipulating\nrates charged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the construction of\nelectric transmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in an Underlying Fund's portfolio may own\nor operate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Fund, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities to BFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy\nVoting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies\nand procedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund.\n\n40\n\nUnder the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies,\nBFA will vote proxies related to Fund\nsecurities in the best interests of the Fund\nand its shareholders. From time to time, a\nvote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales and client responsibilities. In\naddition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure\nthat all engagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ).

The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nInvestment Policies The Board has adopted as\nfundamental policies the following numbered\ninvestment policies, which cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i)\n67% or more of the voting securities present\nat a shareholder meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund. The\nFund has also adopted certain non-fundamental\ninvestment policies, including its investment\nobjective. Non-fundamental investment policies\nmay be changed by the Board without\nshareholder approval. Therefore, the Fund may\nchange its investment objective without\nshareholder approval. Fundamental Investment\nPolicies of the Fund. The Fund may not: 1.\nPurchase the securities of issuers conducting\ntheir principal business activity in the same\nindustry if, immediately after the purchase\nand as a result thereof, the value of the\nFund\u2019s investments in that industry would\nequal or exceed 25% of the current value of\nthe Fund\u2019s total assets, provided that this\nrestriction does not limit the Fund\u2019s: (i)\ninvestments in securities of other investment\ncompanies, (ii) investments in securities\nissued or guaranteed by the U.S. government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities, or (iii)\ninvestments in repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities.\n2. Borrow money, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof real estate investment trusts, mortgage-\nrelated securities and securities of issuers\nengaged in the real estate business, and the\nFund may purchase and hold real estate as a\nresult of the ownership of securities or other\ninstruments. 5. Underwrite securities issued\nby others, except to the extent that the sale\nof portfolio securities by the Fund may be\ndeemed to be an underwriting or as otherwise\npermitted by applicable law. 6. Purchase or\nsell commodities or commodity contracts,\nexcept as permitted by the Investment Company\nAct. 7. Make loans to the extent prohibited by\nthe Investment Company Act. Notations\nRegarding the Fund\u2019s Fundamental Investment\nPolicies The following notations are not\nconsidered to be part of the Fund\u2019s\nfundamental investment policies and are\nsubject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of\n\n42\n\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund\u2019s industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund\u2019s total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f- 4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFund. Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, the Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section\n\n43\n\n12(d)(1). The foregoing restriction does not\nrestrict the Fund from acquiring the shares of\nregistered open-end investment companies to\nthe extent otherwise permissible under other\nprovisions of the 1940 Act, as interpreted,\nmodified or otherwise permitted by regulatory\nauthority having jurisdiction, from time to\ntime. Notations Regarding the Fund\u2019s\nFundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment\nPolicies Unless otherwise indicated, all\nlimitations under the Fund\u2019s fundamental or\nnon-fundamental investment restrictions apply\nonly at the time that a transaction is\nundertaken. Any change in the percentage of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets invested in certain\nsecurities or other instruments resulting from\nmarket fluctuations or other changes in the\nFund\u2019s total assets will not require the Fund\nto dispose of an investment. Continuous\nOffering The method by which Creation Units\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units are issued and sold\nby the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nrequirement and liability provisions of the\n1933 Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent shares and sells\nsuch shares directly to customers or if it\nchooses to couple the creation of new shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nshares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must\ntake into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nshares, generally are required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\n1933 Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of\nthe 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus\ndelivery obligation with respect to shares of\nthe Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule\n153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the prospectus\nis available at the Listing Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is available only with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Fund, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers. Each Trustee serves\nuntil he or she resigns, is removed, dies,\nretires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer\nshall hold office until his or her successor\nis elected and qualifies or until his or her\ndeath, resignation or removal. Trustees who\nare not \u201c interested persons \u201d (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nThe Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 415 funds\nas of October 25, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n52\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Fund and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of the Fund, are engaged worldwide\nin businesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\n58\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding the Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or establishment\nof a short position by the Fund may impair the\nprice of the same security sold short by (and\ntherefore benefit) BlackRock or its other\naccounts or funds, and the purchase of a\nsecurity or covering of a short position in a\nsecurity by the Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds. In addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, the Fund may invest its assets\nin other funds advised by BlackRock, including\nfunds that are managed by one or more of the\nsame portfolio managers, which could result in\nconflicts of interest relating to asset\nallocation, timing of Fund purchases and\nsales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Fund, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of the Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such\n\n59\n\nother business units or entities or their\nclients and such obligations to other business\nunits or entities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund or BlackRock. Subject\nto applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection with their service\nto the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Fund or its shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Fund or its\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program,\n\n60\n\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Fund will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Fund. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Fund will not\nbe charged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order. Subject to applicable\nlaw, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such\n\n61\n\nother BlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Fund and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Fund's assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Fund. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\nthe Fund may be executed on MEMX if third\nparty brokers select MEMX as the appropriate\nvenue for execution of orders placed by\nBlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In\naddition, transactions in Fund shares may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for the\nexecution of such orders. BlackRock has\nadopted policies and procedures designed to\nprevent conflicts of interest from influencing\nproxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf\nof advisory clients, including the Fund, and\nto help ensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\nthe Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material\n\n62\n\nnon-public information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit the Fund's flexibility\nin purchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Fund. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and\n\n63\n\nothers who normally come into possession of\ninformation regarding the Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the Fund),\nmay limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset.\n\n64\n\nBlackRock may not serve as an Authorized\nParticipant in the creation and redemption of\niShares ETFs. Under an ETF Services Agreement,\nthe Fund has retained BRIL, an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units of\nthe Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard transaction\nfee received from Authorized Participants on\neach creation or redemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the ETF Services\nprovided. BlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and development of\nthe ETF Services platform. Citibank may have,\nor from time to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Fund may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with cash\nsubstitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Fund in\ndetermining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Fund related to creation and redemption\nactivity, BlackRock may have incentives to\nimprove Fund performance through the\ncollection of these fees. As these charges are\nbased on estimates, where the charges exceed\nactual transaction- related costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by the Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Fund may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof its investment strategy. Index based funds\nthat seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s\nreceipt of fees from a service provider in\nconnection with the use of systems provided by\nBlackRock may create an incentive for\nBlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider.\n\n65\n\nIn recognition of a BlackRock client\u2019s overall\nrelationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may\noffer special pricing arrangements for certain\nservices provided by BlackRock. Any such\nspecial pricing arrangements will not apply to\nthe client\u2019s investment in the Fund. Present\nand future activities of BlackRock (including\nBFA), its directors, officers and employees,\nin addition to those described in this\nsection, may give rise to additional conflicts\nof interest. Investment Advisory,\nAdministrative and Distribution Services\nInvestment Adviser. BFA serves as investment\nadviser to the Fund pursuant to an investment\nadvisory agreement between the Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, and BFA. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an\ninvestment adviser under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to\nthe supervision of the Board and in conformity\nwith the stated investment policies of the\nFund, manages and administers the Trust and\nthe investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee from the Fund based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets, at the annual\nrate of 0.00%. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act). The investment\nadvisory agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by BFA and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act). Portfolio\nManagers. As of July 31, 2024, the individuals\nnamed as Portfolio Managers in the Fund's\nProspectus were also primarily responsible for\nthe day-to-day management of other iShares\nfunds and certain other types of portfolios\nand/or accounts as follows:\n\n66\n                                              \n  Christopher Chung                           \n  Types of Accounts  Number            Total  \n                                      Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment             30  $78,980,000,000  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment             11   $1,076,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts          0              N/A  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Suzanne Ly                                  \n  Types of Accounts   Number           Total  \n                                      Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment              30    $687,000,000  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment              11  $3,118,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts           2    $433,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below shows, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of July 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  Christopher                                 \n  Chung                                       \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Suzanne Ly                                  \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview\n\n67\n\nThe discussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of October 25, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its underlying index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of October 25, 2024,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. Citibank serves as\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent\nfor the Fund under the Master Services\nAgreement (the \u201c Master Services Agreement \u201d\n). Citibank\u2019s principal address is 388\nGreenwich Street, New York, NY 10013. Pursuant\nto the Master Services Agreement with the\nTrust, Citibank provides necessary\nadministrative, tax and accounting and\nfinancial reporting services for the\nmaintenance and operations of the Trust and\nthe Fund. In addition, Citibank makes\navailable the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services.

Citibank is authorized to\nappoint certain foreign custodians or foreign\ncustody managers for Fund investments outside\nthe U.S. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, Citibank acts as a\ntransfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, Citibank\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA. BFA\npays the compensation because it has agreed to\npay these operating expenses under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement as described\ntherein. JPMorgan serves as custodian for the\nFund in connection with certain securities\nlending activities under a Custody Services\nAgreement. JPMorgan\u2019s principal address is 383\nMadison Avenue, 11 th Floor, New York, NY\n10179.

Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), DTC participants and/or\ninvestor services organizations. BFA or its\naffiliates may, from time to time and from its\nown resources, pay, defray or absorb costs\nrelating to distribution, including payments\nout of its own resources to the Distributor,\nor to otherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund and Underlying\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. The\nFund and Underlying Fund are responsible for\nfees in connection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan in\na money market fund managed by BFA (the \u201c\ncollateral investment fees \u201d ); however, BTC\nhas agreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees a Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%.\nSuch money market fund shares will not be\nsubject to a sales load, redemption fee,\ndistribution fee or service fee. Under the\nsecurities lending program, the Fund is\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of the Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC. Pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement:\n(i) fund-of-funds, such as the Fund, retain\n82% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees), and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable fund-of-funds, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: (i) 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees.\n\n69\n\nBecause the Fund is newly launched, no\nservices have been provided by BTC as the\nFund's securities lending agent, and the Fund\nhad no income and fees/compensation related to\nsecurities lending activities for the fiscal\nyear ended July 31, 2024. Payments by BFA and\nits Affiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c\nBFA Entities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nand other financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Fund.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Fund, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology\n\n70\n\nsupport, platform enhancement, or educational\ncontent, co-marketing and cross-promotional\nefforts. Payments made pursuant to such\narrangements may vary in any year and may be\ndifferent for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Cetera Financial Group, Inc., Charles\nSchwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre\nAG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey\nWright and Associates, LLC, Dynasty Financial\nPartners LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC,\nEnvestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro USA\nSecurities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern\nMutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion\nPortfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public\nHoldings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs. Determination of Net Asset\nValue Valuation of Shares. The NAV for the\nFund is generally calculated as of the close\nof regular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by the Fund is\nas follows: Equity Investments. Equity\nsecurities traded on a recognized securities\nexchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on separate trading\nboards of a securities exchange or through a\nmarket system that provides contemporaneous\ntransaction pricing information (each an \u201c\nExchange \u201d ) are valued using information\nobtained via independent pricing services,\ngenerally at the closing price or, if an\nExchange closing price is not available, the\nlast traded price on that Exchange prior to\nthe time as of which the assets or liabilities\nare valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by the Fund on a day\non which the Fund values such security, the\nprior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Options, Futures, Swaps and Other\nDerivatives. Exchange-traded equity options\n(except those that are customized) for which\nmarket quotations are readily available are\nvalued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions)\n\n71\n\nor ask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich the Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on the Fund\u2019s\nbooks at their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof.\n\n72\n\nWhen determining the price for a Fair Value\nAsset, BFA will seek to determine the price\nthat the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction on\nthe date on which the asset or liability is\nbeing valued, and does not seek to determine\nthe price the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive for selling an asset or liability at a\nlater time or if it holds the asset or\nliability to maturity. Fair value\ndeterminations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances.\n\n73\n\nSection 28(e) of the 1934 Act ( \u201c Section\n28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S. investment adviser,\nunder certain circumstances, to cause an\naccount to pay a broker or dealer a commission\nfor effecting a transaction in securities that\nexceeds the amount another broker or dealer\nwould have charged for effecting the same\ntransaction in recognition of the value of\nbrokerage and research services provided by\nthat broker or dealer. This includes\ncommissions paid on riskless principal\ntransactions in securities under certain\nconditions. From time to time, the Fund may\npurchase new issues of securities in a fixed\nprice offering. In these situations, the\nbroker may be a member of the selling group\nthat will, in addition to selling securities,\nprovide BFA with research services. FINRA has\nadopted rules expressly permitting these types\nof arrangements under certain circumstances.\nGenerally, the broker will provide research \u201c\ncredits \u201d in these situations at a rate that\nis higher than that available for typical\nsecondary market transactions. These\narrangements may not fall within the safe\nharbor of Section 28(e). The Fund anticipates\nthat brokerage transactions involving foreign\nequity securities generally will be conducted\nprimarily on the principal stock exchanges of\nthe applicable country. Foreign equity\nsecurities may be held by the Fund in the form\nof depositary receipts, or other securities\nconvertible into foreign equity securities.\nDepositary receipts may be listed on stock\nexchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the\nU.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like\nother securities traded in the U.S., will be\nsubject to negotiated commission rates. OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Fund will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor execution could be obtained by using a\nbroker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Fund will not deal with affiliated persons\nand affiliated persons of such affiliated\npersons in connection with such transactions.\nThe Fund will not purchase securities during\nthe existence of any underwriting or selling\ngroup relating to such securities of which\nBFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except\npursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFund are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Fund does not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another\n\n74\n\nor to produce greater performance compensation\nto BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a\nrelationship with a client or prospective\nclient; (iv) to compensate a client for past\nservices or benefits rendered to BlackRock or\nto induce future services or benefits to be\nrendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or\nequalize investment performance among\ndifferent client accounts. BFA and the other\nAffiliates may deal, trade and invest for\ntheir own respective accounts in the types of\nsecurities in which the Fund may invest.\nInitial public offerings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of\nsecurities may be over-subscribed and\nsubsequently trade at a premium in the\nsecondary market. When BFA is given an\nopportunity to invest in such an initial\noffering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue, the\nsupply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFund or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund are concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be\n\n75\n\nbeneficial to the Fund. BlackRock may deal,\ntrade and invest for its own account in the\ntypes of securities in which the Fund may\ninvest. BlackRock may, from time to time,\neffect trades on behalf of and for the account\nof the Fund with brokers or dealers that are\naffiliated with BFA, in conformity with the\n1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under\nthese provisions, any commissions paid to\naffiliated brokers or dealers must be\nreasonable and fair compared to the\ncommissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a\n\n76\n\nfund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or\nfor a combination of cash or securities.\nFurther, in the event of a termination of the\nTrust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might\nelect to pay cash redemptions to all\nshareholders, with an in-kind election for\nshareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares.\n\n77\n\nSelling Shareholders may sell shares owned by\nthem directly or through broker-dealers, in\naccordance with applicable law, on any\nnational securities exchange on which the\nshares may be listed or quoted at the time of\nsale, through trading systems, in the OTC\nmarket or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange or the listing\nexchange for the Fund\u2019s exchange-traded\noptions close earlier than normal, the Fund\nmay require orders to be placed earlier in the\nday. The following table sets forth the number\nof shares of the Fund that constitute a\nCreation Unit for the Fund and the approximate\nvalue of such Creation Unit as of October 25,\n2024:\n                                              \n  Shares                    ApproximateValue  \n  PerCreation Unit   PerCreationUnit (U.S.$)  \n  20,000                            $500,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year\u2019s Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund is\ngenerally cash. However, in some cases the\nconsideration consists of a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets or other\npositions (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\n( \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d or \u201c Creation Basket\n\u201d ) and the Cash Component computed as\ndescribed below. Together, the Deposit\nSecurities and the Cash Component constitute\nthe \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which will be applicable\n(subject to possible amendment or correction)\nto creation requests received in proper form.\nThe Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of a given Fund until such\ntime as the next-announced Fund Deposit is\nmade available. The \u201c Cash Component \u201d is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares (per Creation Unit) and the \u201c\nDeposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal to\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit.\n\n78\n\nThe Fund\u2019s current policy is to accept cash in\nsubstitution for the Deposit Securities it\nmight otherwise accept as in-kind\nconsideration for the purchase of Creation\nUnits. The Fund may, at times, elect to\nreceive Deposit Securities (i.e., the in-kind\ndeposit of a designated portfolio of\nsecurities) and a Cash Component as\nconsideration for the purchase of Creation\nUnits. If the Fund elects to accept Deposit\nSecurities, a purchaser\u2019s delivery of the\nDeposit Securities together with the Cash\nComponent will constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit,\n\u201d which will represent the consideration for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. Please see the Cash\nPurchase Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the Deposit\nSecurity method for further information on\npurchasing Creation Units of the Fund. The\nDeposit Securities, in connection with a\npurchase of a Creation Unit of the Fund, will\nconsist of a pro rata basket of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio except for differences due to\nminimum trading sizes for bonds, minimum lot\nsizes or rounding. The identity and number or\npar value of the Deposit Securities change\npursuant to changes in the composition of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective(s) of the Fund.\nThe composition of the Deposit Securities may\nalso change in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. The Trust may,\nin its sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. When partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units are available or specified for\nthe Fund (Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally offered solely for cash), they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Such Authorized Participant\nwill agree, pursuant to the terms of such\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and on behalf\nof itself or any investor on whose behalf it\nwill act, to certain conditions, including\nthat such Authorized Participant will make\navailable in advance of each purchase of\nshares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component, once the NAV of a Creation\nUnit is next determined after receipt of the\npurchase order in proper form, together with\nthe transaction fees described below. An\nAuthorized Participant, acting on behalf of an\ninvestor, may require the investor to enter\ninto an agreement with such Authorized\nParticipant with respect to certain matters,\nincluding payment of the Cash Component.\nInvestors who are not Authorized Participants\nmust make appropriate arrangements with an\nAuthorized Participant. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not be\na DTC Participant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor\u2019s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a\n\n79\n\nresult, purchase orders placed through an\nAuthorized Participant may result in\nadditional charges to such investor. The Trust\ndoes not expect to enter into an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with more than a small\nnumber of DTC Participants. A list of current\nAuthorized Participants may be obtained from\nthe Distributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Placement of Creation Orders. Fund\nDeposits must be delivered through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), through DTC (for corporate and\nmunicipal securities) or through a central\ndepository account, such as with Euroclear or\nDTC, maintained by Citibank or a sub-custodian\n(a \u201c Central Depository Account \u201d ). Any\nportion of the Fund Deposit that may not be\ndelivered through the Federal Reserve System\nor DTC must be delivered through a Central\nDepository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers\nmade through DTC must be ordered by the DTC\nParticipant in a timely fashion so as to\nensure the delivery of the requisite number of\nDeposit Securities through DTC to the account\nof the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund\nDeposit transfers made through the Federal\nReserve System must be deposited by the\nparticipant institution in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite\nnumber or amount of Deposit Securities or cash\nthrough the Federal Reserve System to the\naccount of the Fund generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.\nFund Deposit transfers made through a Central\nDepository Account must be completed pursuant\nto the requirements established by the\ncustodian or sub-custodian for such Central\nDepository Account generally before 2:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. The \u201c\nSettlement Date \u201d for all funds is generally\nthe second business day after the Transmittal\nDate. All questions as to the number of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered, and the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time\nof receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to\nCitibank through the Federal Reserve Bank wire\ntransfer system in a timely manner so as to be\nreceived by Citibank generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If\nthe Cash Component and the Deposit Securities\nare not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nthe Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncanceled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using\nthe Fund Deposit as newly constituted to\nreflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the second\nBusiness Day following the day on which the\npurchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor, provided that the relevant Fund\nDeposit has been received by the Fund prior to\nsuch time. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of the Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any\nBusiness Day in order to receive that day\u2019s\nNAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant in the form required by\nthe Fund to the Distributor or its agent\npursuant to\n\n80\n\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Economic or market\ndisruptions or changes, or telephone or other\ncommunication failure, may impede the ability\nto reach the Distributor or its agent or an\nAuthorized Participant. The Fund\u2019s deadline\nspecified above for the submission of purchase\norders is referred to as the Fund\u2019s \u201c Cutoff\nTime. \u201d The Distributor or its agent, in their\ndiscretion, may permit the submission of such\norders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor\u2019s or its\nagent\u2019s proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund\u2019s Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor\u2019s behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund\u2019s right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, Citibank, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d (i.e.,\none Business Day after trade date). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle Creation Unit\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1,\nincluding a shorter settlement period, as\napplicable. For example, the Fund reserves the\nright to settle Creation Unit transactions on\na basis other than T+1 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates (i.e., the last day the holder\nof a security can sell the security and still\nreceive dividend (payable on the security) and\nin certain other circumstances. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\nAgreement with the Distributor, the Fund will\nissue Creation Units to such Authorized\nParticipant, notwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant\u2019s\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Fund. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby the Fund or its custodian on the\ncontractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund\u2019s current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges.\n\n81\n\nIn certain cases, Authorized Participants may\ncreate and redeem Creation Units on the same\ntrade date and in these instances, the Fund\nreserves the right to settle these\ntransactions on a net basis or require a\nrepresentation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by such\nFund and the Fund\u2019s determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each creation\norder, which consists of (1) a fee for\nproviding the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs charged by the\nFund custodian in connection with the issuance\nof Creation Units for such creation order ( \u201c\nCustody Transaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent BlackRock-advised funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in the Fund\u2019s Creation\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets\nand settlement locations associated with the\nissuance of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth the Fund\u2019s standard creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nas of October 4, 2024, although the actual fee\ncharged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\ndepending on the factors discussed above, and\nmay be higher than the fee set forth below. If\na purchase consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution, price movement and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs).\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Deposit Securities\nto the Fund. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith creation transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to acquire Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth the Fund\u2019s standard creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nas of October 4, 2024 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge for  \n  Fee*                  Creations**           \n  $157.50               3.0%                  \n                                              \n* The standard creation transaction fee\nconsists of the ETF Servicing Fee and the\nCustody Transaction Costs. The standard\ncreation transaction fee may vary over time\ndepending on the factors discussed above, and\nmay be higher than the see set forth above. **\n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\ncreation transaction fee. Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of the Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Fund will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Fund. The Fund publishes\nthe designated portfolio of securities\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) that will be\napplicable to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nFund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ),\nand an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) are applicable, in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of the\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund\n\n82\n\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Procedures\nand requirements governing redemption\ntransactions are set forth in the handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Unless cash redemptions are\navailable or specified for the Fund, the\nredemption proceeds for a Creation Unit\ngenerally consist of Fund Securities, plus the\nCash Amount, which is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of the Fund Security to the\nAuthorized Participant (or to an investor on\nwhose behalf the Authorized Participant is\nacting) would be restricted under applicable\nsecurities or other local laws or due to a\ntrading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of\nthe Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant would result in the disposition of\nthe Fund Security by the Authorized\nParticipant due to restrictions under\napplicable securities or other local laws;\n(iii) when the delivery of the Fund Security\nto the Authorized Participant would result in\nunfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when the Fund\nSecurity cannot be settled or otherwise\ndelivered in time to facilitate an in-kind\nredemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as the Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeem Creation Units for Fund Securities, but\nthe Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash\noption for redemption of Creation Units. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified for the Fund, they will be effected\nin essentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\nETF Services. BRIL will receive from an\nAuthorized Participant a standard transaction\nfee on each redemption order, which consists\nof (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody\nTransaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain\nthe ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF\nServices Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse\nany Custody Transaction Costs to the Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being redeemed, which amount\nwill vary among different BlackRock-advised\nfunds based on a number of factors, including\nthe complexity of the order and the types of\nsecurities or instruments included in the\nFund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets, and settlement\nlocations associated with the redemption of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund\u2019s standard redemption transaction fee\nthat would have been charged as of October 4,\n2024, although the actual fee charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary depending on the\nfactors discussed above, and may be higher\nthan the fee set forth below. If a redemption\nconsists solely or partially of cash, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\ncover (up to the maximum amount shown below)\ncertain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,\nexecution, price movement and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs). Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from the Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services.\n\n83\n\nThe following table sets forth the Fund\u2019s\nstandard redemption transaction fee that would\nhave been charged as of October 4, 2024 and\nmaximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n  Standard             Maximum                \n  RedemptionTransact\u2026  AdditionalCharge for   \n  Fee                  Redemptions*           \n  $157.50              2.0%                   \n                                              \n* The standard redemption transaction fee\nconsists of the ETF Servicing Fee and Custody\nTransaction Costs. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee may vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth above. * *As a\npercentage of the net asset value per Creation\nUnit, inclusive of the standard redemption\ntransaction fee. Placement of Redemption\nOrders. Redemption requests for Creation Units\nof the Fund must be submitted to the\nDistributor or its agent by or through an\nAuthorized Participant. An Authorized\nParticipant must submit an irrevocable request\nto redeem shares of the Fund generally before\n4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day,\nin order to receive that day\u2019s NAV. On days\nwhen the Listing Exchange closes earlier than\nnormal, the Fund may require orders to redeem\nCreation Units to be placed earlier that day.\nInvestors, other than Authorized Participants,\nare responsible for making arrangements for a\nredemption request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. The\nAuthorized Participant must transmit the\nrequest for redemption in the form required by\nthe Fund to the Distributor or its agent in\naccordance with procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nshould be aware that their particular broker\nmay not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\nrequests to redeem Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor\u2019s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant who has executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund\u2019s transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund\u2019s\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund\u2019s transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor\u2019s shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\none Business Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a basis other than\nT+1, including a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. Delayed settlement may occur due to a\nnumber of different reasons, including,\nwithout limitation, settlement cycles for the\nunderlying securities, unscheduled market\nclosings, an effort to link distribution to\ndividend record dates and ex-dates and newly\nannounced holidays. If the Fund includes a\nforeign investment in its basket, and if a\nlocal market holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of\n\n84\n\nthe foreign investment in response to a\nredemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. If neither the\nAuthorized Participant nor the Beneficial\nOwner on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting has appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of Fund\nSecurities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund\u2019s brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\u2019s\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Fund or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby Citibank and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of Citibank and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. The right of redemption may\nbe suspended or the date of payment postponed\nwith respect to the Fund: (i) for any period\nduring which the Listing Exchange is closed\n(other than customary weekend and holiday\nclosings); (ii) for any period during which\ntrading on the Listing Exchange is suspended\nor restricted; (iii) for any period during\nwhich an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund will accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund\u2019s policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors.\n\n85\n\nCurrent U.S. federal income tax laws dictate\nthat capital gain or loss realized from the\nredemption of Creation Units will generally\ncreate long-term capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Creation\nUnits for more than one year, or short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Creation Units\nwere held for one year or less, if the\nCreation Units are held as capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. References to the Fund\nwill also generally apply to the Underlying\nFunds as well. Regulated Investment Company\nQualifications. The Fund intends to qualify\nfor treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. The Fund will be subject to\nincome tax at regular corporate rates on any\ntaxable income or gains that it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders. If the Fund\nfails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC\nor fails to meet the distribution requirement,\nall of its taxable income will be subject to\ntax at regular corporate income tax rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and such distributions generally\nwill be taxable to shareholders as ordinary\ndividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and\n\n86\n\nits capital gains for each taxable year, the\nFund may decide to retain a portion of its\nincome or gains if the Fund determines that\ndoing so is in the interest of its\nshareholders. The Fund will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. If the\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it\nmust pay out its earnings and profits\naccumulated in that year in order to qualify\nagain as a RIC. If the Fund fails to qualify\nas a RIC for a period greater than two taxable\nyears, the Fund may be required to recognize\nany net built-in gains with respect to certain\nof its assets ( i.e., the excess of the\naggregate gains, including items of income,\nover aggregate losses that would have been\nrealized with respect to such assets if the\nFund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a\nRIC in a subsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund\nwill be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. Long-\nterm capital distributions from the Underlying\nFunds paid in December or, in certain cases,\nJanuary in satisfaction of this rule will be\nsubject to potential distribution by the Fund\nin the following calendar year. Net Capital\nLoss Carryforwards. Net capital loss\ncarryforwards may be applied against any net\nrealized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Because the\nFund is expected to invest in an Underlying\nFund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses on sales of\nshares of an Underlying Fund may be\nindefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Distributions of short-term capital\ngains by an Underlying Fund will be recognized\nas ordinary income by the Fund and would not\nbe offset by the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund. Long-term capital gains are eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for\nnon-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts.\n\n87\n\nIf an individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of the Fund, a\nshareholder will realize a taxable gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized and the shareholder\u2019s basis in\nshares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by\nthe Fund will be treated as a sale for this\npurpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are capital\nassets in the shareholder\u2019s hands and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the shares\nare held for more than one year and short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor one year or less. Any loss realized on a\nsale or exchange will be disallowed to the\nextent the shares disposed of are replaced,\nincluding replacement through the reinvesting\nof dividends or capital gains distributions,\nor by an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the\n\n88\n\nsame rule also applies to a disposition of the\nnewly acquired shares made within 90 days of\nthe second acquisition. This provision\nprevents shareholders from immediately\ndeducting the sales charge by shifting their\ninvestments within a family of mutual funds.\nBackup Withholding. In certain cases, the Fund\nwill be required to withhold at a 24% rate and\nremit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts\nwithheld from any distributions paid to a\nshareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number; (ii)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS;\n(iii) has failed to certify to the Fund that\nsuch shareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding; or (iv) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and any amount withheld\nmay be credited against a shareholder's U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. Sections 351 and\n362. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the\nright to reject an order for a purchase of\nshares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nshares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. An Underlying Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require an Underlying\nFund to mark-to-market certain types of the\npositions in its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them\nas if they were closed out at the end of each\nyear) and (b) may cause an Underlying Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Underlying Fund will\nmonitor its transactions, will make the\nappropriate tax elections and will make the\nappropriate entries in its books and records\nwhen it acquires any zero coupon security,\nnon-U.S. currency, forward contract, option,\nfutures contract or hedged investment in order\nto mitigate the effect of these rules and\nprevent disqualification of an Underlying Fund\nas a RIC. An Underlying Fund\u2019s investments in\nso-called \u201c Section 1256 contracts, \u201d such as\nregulated futures contracts, most non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts traded in the\ninterbank market and options on most security\nindexes, are subject to special tax rules. All\nSection 1256 contracts held by an Underlying\nFund at the end of its taxable year are\nrequired to be marked to their market value,\nand any unrealized gain or loss on those\npositions will be included in an Underlying\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by an Underlying Fund from positions\nin Section 1256 contracts closed during the\ntaxable year. Provided such positions were\nheld as capital assets and were not part of a\n\u201c hedging transaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c\nstraddle, \u201d 60% of the resulting net gain or\nloss will be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will\nbe treated as short-term capital gain or loss,\nregardless of the period of time the positions\nwere actually held by an Underlying Fund. As a\nresult of entering into swap contracts, an\nUnderlying Fund may make or receive periodic\nnet payments. An Underlying Fund may also make\nor receive a payment when a swap is terminated\nprior to maturity through an assignment of the\nswap or other closing transaction. Periodic\nnet payments will generally constitute\nordinary income or deductions, while\ntermination of a swap will generally result in\ncapital gain or loss (which will be a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if an Underlying\nFund has been a party to the swap for more\nthan one year). With respect to certain types\nof swaps, an Underlying Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss.\n\n89\n\nQualified Dividend Income. Distributions by\nthe Fund of investment company taxable income\n(including any short-term capital gains),\nwhether received in cash or shares, will be\ntaxable either as ordinary income or as\nqualified dividend income, which is eligible\nto be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to\nthe extent the Fund receives qualified\ndividend income on the securities it holds and\nthe Fund reports the distribution as qualified\ndividend income. Qualified dividend income is,\nin general, dividend income from taxable U.S.\ncorporations (but generally not from U.S.\nREITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (\ne.g. , non-U.S. corporations that are not\nPFICs and which are incorporated in a\npossession of the U.S. or in certain countries\nwith a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S.,\nor the stock of which is readily tradable on\nan established securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but\nnot with Hong Kong, which is treated as a\nseparate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes),\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by the\nFund for securities lent out by the Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom the Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or the Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from the Underlying Funds and that\nare attributable to dividends paid by U.S.\ncorporations may qualify for the U.S. federal\ndividends received deduction for corporations.\nA 46-day minimum holding period during the\n90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-\ndividend date (or 91-day minimum holding\nperiod during the 180 period beginning 90 days\nprior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at the Fund level, the\nUnderlying Fund level and shareholder level,\nfor a dividend to be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Restrictions may\napply if indebtedness, including a short sale,\nis attributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by an\nUnderlying Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt such as individual retirement\naccounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans,\npension plans and certain charitable entities;\n(ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable\ndeductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be\neligible for reduced U.S. withholding for\nnon-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty\ncountries; and (iv) cause the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund to be subject to tax if\ncertain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust.\n\n90\n\nThe Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs\nthat are expected to generate excess inclusion\nincome, but the Fund may not always be\nsuccessful in doing so. Because information\nabout a REIT\u2019s investments may be inadequate\nor inaccurate, or because a REIT may change\nits investment program, the Fund may not be\nsuccessful in avoiding the consequences\ndescribed above. Avoidance of investments in\nREITs that generate excess inclusion income\nmay require the Fund to forego otherwise\nattractive investment opportunities. Non-U.S.\nInvestments. Under Section 988 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime an Underlying Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime an Underlying Fund actually collects such\nincome or pays such liabilities are generally\ntreated as ordinary income or ordinary loss.\nIn general, gains (and losses) realized on\ndebt instruments will be treated as Section\n988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable\nto changes in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts and certain\nnon-U.S. currency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless an Underlying\nFund was to elect otherwise. If your Fund\nshares are loaned pursuant to securities\nlending arrangements, you may lose the ability\nto use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through\nby the Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid\nwhile the shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. The Underlying Funds, if invested in\nnon-U.S. positions, may be subject to non-U.S.\nincome taxes and non-U.S. financial\ntransactions taxes. Each Underlying Fund that\nis permitted to do so may elect to \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to its investors, including the\nFund, the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid\nby the Underlying Fund. If more than 50% of\nthe total assets of an Underlying Fund at the\nclose of a year consist of non-U.S. stocks or\nsecurities (generally for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ) (and 50% of the total assets of\nthe Fund at the close of the year consists of\nnon-U.S. securities, or, at the close of each\nquarter, shares of Underlying Funds), the Fund\nmay be eligible to elect to \u201c pass through \u201d\nsuch amounts to their stockholders and may do\nso, depending upon circumstances. Passive\nForeign Investment Companies. If an Underlying\nFund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If an Underlying Fund were to invest\nin a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c\nqualified electing fund \u201d under the Internal\nRevenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing\nrequirements, an Underlying Fund might be\nrequired to include in income each year a\nportion of the ordinary earnings and net\ncapital gains of the qualified electing fund,\neven if not distributed to an Underlying Fund,\nand such amounts would be subject to the 90%\nand excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, an Underlying Fund would be required\nto obtain certain annual information from the\nPFICs in which it invests, which may be\ndifficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, an Underlying Fund may make a\nmark-to-market election that would result in\nan Underlying Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, an Underlying Fund\nwould report any such gains as ordinary income\nand would deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by an Underlying Fund and,\nonce made, would be effective for all\nsubsequent taxable years, unless revoked with\nthe consent of the IRS. By making the\nelection, an Underlying Fund could potentially\nameliorate the adverse tax consequences with\nrespect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC,\nbut in any particular year may be required to\nrecognize income in excess of the\ndistributions it receives from PFICs and its\nproceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. An\nUnderlying Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. An Underlying\nFund will make the appropriate tax elections,\nif possible, and take any additional steps\nthat are necessary to mitigate the effects of\nthese rules. Reporting. If a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss with respect to the Fund\u2019s\nshares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a\ncorporate shareholder, the shareholder must\nfile with the IRS a disclosure statement on\nIRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of\nportfolio securities are in many cases\nexempted from this reporting requirement,\n\n91\n\nbut under current guidance, shareholders of a\nRIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. Other Taxes. Dividends,\ndistributions and redemption proceeds may also\nbe subject to additional state, local and\nnon-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder\u2019s\nparticular situation. Taxation of Non-U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends paid by the Fund to\nnon-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to\nwithholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced\nrate specified by an applicable income tax\ntreaty to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gains. Dividends\npaid by the Fund from net tax-exempt income or\nlong-term capital gains are generally not\nsubject to such withholding tax. In order to\nobtain a reduced rate of withholding, a\nnon-U.S. shareholder will be required to\nprovide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to\nbenefits under a treaty. The withholding tax\ndoes not apply to regular dividends paid to a\nnon-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form\nW-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are\neffectively connected with the non-U.S.\nshareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. Instead, the effectively\nconnected dividends will be subject to regular\nU.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder\nwere a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S.\ncorporation receiving effectively connected\ndividends may also be subject to additional \u201c\nbranch profits tax \u201d imposed at a rate of 30%\n(or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS\nForm W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be\nsubject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Properly-reported dividends\nare generally exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax where they (i) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net interest\nincome \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S. source\ninterest income, other than certain contingent\ninterest and interest from obligations of a\ncorporation or partnership in which the Fund\nis at least a 10% shareholder or partner,\nreduced by expenses that are allocable to such\nincome) or (ii) are paid in respect of the\nFund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term capital gains \u201d\n(generally, the excess of the Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gain over the Fund\u2019s long-\nterm capital loss for such taxable year).\nHowever, depending on its circumstances, the\nFund may report all, some or none of its\npotentially eligible dividends as such\nqualified net interest income or as qualified\nshort-term capital gains and/or treat such\ndividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible\nfor this exemption from withholding. In order\nto qualify for this exemption from\nwithholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need\nto comply with applicable certification\nrequirements relating to its non-U.S. status\n(including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form).\nIn the case of shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving the Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. and the foreign shareholder\nwould be subject to withholding tax at a rate\nof 21% and would generally be required to file\na U.S. federal income tax return. Similar\nconsequences would generally apply to a\nforeign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund\nshares unless the Fund is domestically\ncontrolled (meaning that more than 50% of the\nvalue of the Fund's shares is held by U.S.\nshareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns\nno more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any\ntime during the five-year period ending on the\ndate of sale. Finally, a domestically\ncontrolled Fund may be required to recognize a\nportion of its gain on the in-kind\ndistribution of certain U.S. real property\ninterests. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund. A foreign shareholder\nalso may be subject to certain \u201c wash sale \u201d\nrules to prevent the avoidance of the tax\nfiling and payment obligations discussed above\nthrough the sale and repurchase of Fund\nshares. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund.\n\n92\n\nSeparately, a 30% withholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and\nother income items paid to: (i) foreign\nfinancial institutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they agree to collect\nand disclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of the Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements. BlackRock has adopted guidelines\nand procedures (together and as from time to\ntime amended, the \u201c BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\naccounts managed by BlackRock.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nAppendix B \u2013 Description of Fixed-Income\nRatings A rating is generally assigned to a\nfixed-income security at the time of issuance\nby a credit rating agency designated as a\nNRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time\nto time revise such ratings, they undertake no\nobligation to do so, and the ratings given to\nsecurities at issuance do not necessarily\nrepresent ratings which would be given to\nthese securities on a particular subsequent\ndate. NRSROs may rate specific investments (\ne.g. , bonds), issuers ( e.g. , corporations,\ngovernments and financial institutions) and/or\nprograms ( e.g. , commercial paper programs).\nHowever, certain types of investments may not\nbe rated by NRSROs, such as certain\ngovernment/sovereign obligations, US agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, time deposits at\nfinancial institutions, and derivative\ninstruments such as credit default swaps. For\nthese types of investments, as well as US\nTreasury securities (some of which are not\nrated), where a NRSRO has not rated the\nspecific investment but has rated the\ninvestment\u2019s issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, BFA\nmay consider the investment to have the same\nNRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, as\napplicable. In the case of municipal\nsecurities, where one NRSRO provides multiple\nratings for the same security ( e.g. , \u201c\nunderlying, \u201d \u201c insured \u201d and/or \u201c enhanced \u201d\nratings), BFA may consider the security to\nhave the highest of the multiple ratings. New\nissue securities (regardless of type) may not\nbe rated by a NRSRO at the time of their\ninitial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or\nterm sheets for new issue securities may\ninclude an expected rating for the security\n(as determined by the underwriter and/or\nissuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of\nthe security. If applicable, when deciding\nwhether to purchase a new issue security that\nhas not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may\nattribute an expected rating to the security\nbased on: (i) the expected rating of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security;\n(ii) the NRSRO\u2019s rating for the issuer of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security; or\n(iii) with respect to asset-backed securities,\nthe rating of a prior issuance having a\nsimilar structure or the same sponsor. Where\nthe investment objective of the Fund is to\ntrack the performance of an index that\nincludes credit ratings eligibility criteria\nas part of its index methodology, the Fund may\npurchase any security within the index, such\nsecurity having been determined by the index\nprovider as meeting its credit ratings\neligibility criteria. The credit ratings\npractices of an index provider may differ from\nBlackRock\u2019s practices, as described above.\nFurther, the Fund may invest, directly or\nindirectly, in securities that are not rated\nby a rating agency or securities with a credit\nrating that differs from the credit rating\nspecified in its index methodology in various\ncircumstances, including where a security is\ndowngraded but not yet removed from an index,\nfollowing the removal of a security from an\nindex prior to its sale by the Fund or as a\nresult of a corporate action or restructuring\naffecting an issuer of a security held by the\nFund. Fixed-income securities which are\nunrated may expose the investor to risks with\nrespect to capacity to pay interest or repay\nprincipal which are similar to the risks of\nlower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of\nthese securities is dependent on the\ninvestment adviser\u2019s judgment, analysis and\nexperience in the evaluation of such\nsecurities. Investors should note that the\nassignment of a rating to a security by an\nNRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent\ndevelopments on the issuer\u2019s ability to make\ninterest and principal payments or on the\nlikelihood of default. Securities deemed to be\nhigh yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.\nThe descriptions below relate to general long-\nterm and short-term obligations of an issuer.\nMoody\u2019s Ratings Long-Term Obligations Aaa:\nObligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the\nhighest quality, subject to the lowest level\nof credit risk. Aa: Obligations rated Aa are\njudged to be of high quality and are subject\nto very low credit risk. A: Obligations rated\nA are judged to be upper-medium grade and are\nsubject to low credit risk. Baa: Obligations\nrated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and\nsubject to moderate credit risk and as such\nmay possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics.\n\nB-1\n\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be\nspeculative and are subject to substantial\ncredit risk. B: Obligations rated B are\nconsidered speculative and are subject to high\ncredit risk. Caa: Obligations rated Caa are\njudged to be speculative, of poor standing and\nare subject to very high credit risk. Ca:\nObligations rated Ca are highly speculative\nand are likely in, or very near, default, with\nsome prospect of recovery of principal and\ninterest. C: Obligations rated C are the\nlowest rated and are typically in default,\nwith little prospect for recovery of principal\nor interest. Note: Moody's appends numerical\nmodifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating\nclassification from Aa through Caa. The\nmodifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks\nin the higher end of its generic rating\ncategory; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range\nranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a\nranking in the lower end of that generic\nrating category. Absence of Rating: Where no\nrating has been assigned or where a rating has\nbeen withdrawn, it may be for reasons\nunrelated to the creditworthiness of the\nissue. Should no rating be assigned, the\nreason may be one of the following: 1. An\napplication was not received or accepted. 2.\nThe issue or issuer belongs to a group of\nsecurities or entities that are not rated as a\nmatter of policy. 3. There is a lack of\nessential data pertaining to the issue or\nissuer. 4. The issue was privately placed, in\nwhich case the rating is not published in\nMoody\u2019s publications. Withdrawal may occur if\nnew and material circumstances arise, the\neffects of which preclude satisfactory\nanalysis; if there is no longer available\nreasonable up-to-date data to permit a\njudgment to be formed; if a bond is called for\nredemption; or for other reasons. Short-Term\nObligations Moody\u2019s short-term debt ratings\nare opinions of the ability of issuers to\nhonor short-term financial obligations,\ngenerally with an original maturity not\nexceeding thirteen months. Moody's employs the\nfollowing designations to indicate the\nrelative repayment ability of rated issuers:\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions)\nrated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay\nshort-term debt obligations. P-2: Issuers (or\nsupporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a\nstrong ability to repay short-term debt\nobligations. P-3: Issuers (or supporting\ninstitutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable\nability to repay short-term obligations. NP:\nIssuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not\nPrime do not fall within any of the Prime\nrating categories. US Municipal Short-Term\nDebt Obligations There are three rating\ncategories for short-term municipal\nobligations that are considered investment-\ngrade and are designated as Municipal\nInvestment Grade (MIG). In addition, those\nshort-term obligations that are of speculative\nquality are designated SG, or speculative\ngrade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of\nthe obligation. MIG 1: This designation\ndenotes superior credit quality. Excellent\nprotection is afforded by established cash\nflows, highly reliable liquidity support, or\ndemonstrated broad-based access to the market\nfor refinancing. MIG 2: This designation\ndenotes strong credit quality. Margins of\nprotection are ample, although not as large as\nin the preceding group. MIG 3: This\ndesignation denotes acceptable credit quality.\nLiquidity and cash-flow protection may be\nnarrow, and market access for refinancing is\nlikely to be less well-established.\n\nB-2\n\nSG: This designation denotes speculative-grade\ncredit quality. Debt instruments in this\ncategory may lack sufficient margins of\nprotection. S&P Global Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: An obligation rated AAA has\nthe highest rating assigned by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nextremely strong. AA: An obligation rated AA\ndiffers from the highest-rated obligations\nonly to a small degree. The obligor\u2019s capacity\nto meet its financial commitment is very\nstrong. A: An obligation rated A is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher-rated\ncategories. However, the obligor\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is still strong. BBB: An obligation\nrated BBB exhibits adequate protection\nparameters. However, adverse economic\nconditions or changing circumstances are more\nlikely to lead to a weakened capacity of the\nobligor to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation. BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:\nObligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are\nregarded as having significant speculative\ncharacteristics. BB indicates the least degree\nof speculation and C the highest. While such\nobligations will likely have some quality and\nprotective characteristics, these may be\noutweighed by large uncertainties or major\nexposures to adverse conditions. BB: An\nobligation rated BB is less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues.\nHowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nor exposure to adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions which could lead to the\nobligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. B: An\nobligation rated B is more vulnerable to\nnonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the\nobligor currently has the capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation.\nAdverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions will likely impair the obligor\u2019s\ncapacity or willingness to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. CCC: An\nobligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable\nto nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable\nbusiness, financial, and economic conditions\nfor the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. In the event of\nadverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions, the obligor is not likely to have\nthe capacity to meet its financial commitment\non the obligation. CC: An obligation rated CC\nis currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.\nThe CC rating is used when a default has not\nyet occurred, but S&P Global Ratings expects\ndefault to be a virtual certainty, regardless\nof the anticipated time to default. C: An\nobligation rated C is currently highly\nvulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation\nis expected to have lower relative seniority\nor lower ultimate recovery compared to\nobligations that are rated higher. D: An\nobligation rated D is in default or in breach\nof an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital\ninstruments, the D rating category is used\nwhen payments on an obligation are not made on\nthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings\nbelieves that such payments will be made\nwithin five business days in the absence of a\nstated grace period or within the earlier of\nthe stated grace period or 30 calendar days.\nThe D rating also will be used upon the filing\nof a bankruptcy petition or the taking of\nsimilar action and where default on an\nobligation is a virtual certainty, for example\ndue to automatic stay provisions. An\nobligation's rating is lowered to D if it is\nsubject to a distressed exchange offer. NR: NR\nindicates no rating has been requested, or\nthat there is insufficient information on\nwhich to base a rating, or that S&P Global\nRatings does not rate a particular obligation\nas a matter of policy. Note: The ratings from\nAA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a\nplus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative\nstanding within the major rating categories.\nShort-Term Obligations\n\nB-3\n\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is\nrated in the highest category by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor's capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nstrong. Within this category, certain\nobligations are designated with a plus sign\n(+). This indicates that the obligor's\ncapacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthese obligations is extremely strong. A-2: A\nshort-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rating\ncategories. However, the obligor's capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is satisfactory. A-3: A short-term\nobligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters. However, adverse\neconomic conditions or changing circumstances\nare more likely to lead to a weakened capacity\nof the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. B: A short-term\nobligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable\nand has significant speculative\ncharacteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments;\nhowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nwhich could lead to the obligor's inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments. C:\nA short-term obligation rated C is currently\nvulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon\nfavorable business, financial, and economic\nconditions for the obligor to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. D: A\nshort-term obligation rated D is in default or\nin breach of an imputed promise. For non-\nhybrid capital instruments, the D rating\ncategory is used when payments on an\nobligation are not made on the date due,\nunless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace\nperiod. However, any stated grace period\nlonger than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The D rating also will\nbe used upon the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual\ncertainty, for example due to automatic stay\nprovisions. An obligation's rating is lowered\nto D if it is subject to a distressed exchange\noffer. Municipal Short-Term Obligations An S&P\nU.S. municipal note rating reflects S&P Global\nRatings opinion about the liquidity factors\nand market access risks unique to the notes.\nNotes due in three years or less will likely\nreceive a note rating. Notes with an original\nmaturity of more than three years will most\nlikely receive a long-term debt rating. SP-1:\nStrong capacity to pay principal and interest.\nAn issue determined to possess a very strong\ncapacity to pay debt service is given a plus\n(+) designation. SP-2: Satisfactory capacity\nto pay principal and interest, with some\nvulnerability to adverse financial and\neconomic changes over the term of the notes.\nSP-3: Speculative capacity to pay principal\nand interest. Fitch Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA\nratings denote the lowest expectation of\ncredit risk. They are assigned only in cases\nof exceptionally strong capacity for payment\nof financial commitments. This capacity is\nhighly unlikely to be adversely affected by\nforeseeable events. AA: Very high credit\nquality. AA ratings denote expectations of\nvery low credit risk. They indicate very\nstrong capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable\nevents. A: High credit quality. A ratings\ndenote expectations of low credit risk. The\ncapacity for payment of financial commitments\nis considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions than is the\ncase for higher ratings. BBB: Good credit\nquality. BBB ratings indicate that\nexpectations of credit risk are currently low.\nThe capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments is considered adequate but adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions are more\nlikely to impair this capacity.\n\nB-4\n\nBB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk,\nparticularly in the event of adverse changes\nin business or economic conditions over time;\nhowever, business or financial alternatives\nmay be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly speculative.\nB ratings indicate that material credit risk\nis present. CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC\nratings indicate that substantial credit risk\nis present. CC: Very high levels of credit\nrisk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of\ncredit risk. C: Exceptionally high levels of\ncredit risk. C indicates exceptionally high\nlevels of credit risk. Defaulted obligations\ntypically are not assigned RD or D ratings,\nbut are instead rated in the B to C rating\ncategories, depending upon their recovery\nprospects and other relevant characteristics.\nThis approach better aligns obligations that\nhave comparable overall expected loss but\nvarying vulnerability to default and loss.\nNote: The modifiers \u201c + \u201d or \u201c - \u201d may be\nappended to a rating to denote relative status\nwithin major rating categories. Such suffixes\nare not added to the AAA obligation rating\ncategory, or to corporate finance obligation\nratings in the categories below CCC. The\nsubscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to\ndenote embedded market risk which is beyond\nthe scope of the rating. The designation is\nintended to make clear that the rating solely\naddresses the counterparty risk of the issuing\nbank. It is not meant to indicate any\nlimitation in the analysis of the counterparty\nrisk, which in all other respects follows\npublished Fitch criteria for analyzing the\nissuing financial institution. Fitch does not\nrate these instruments where the principal is\nto any degree subject to market risk. Short-\nTerm Obligations (Corporate and Public\nFinance) A short-term issuer or obligation\nrating is based in all cases on the short-term\nvulnerability to default of the rated entity\nor security stream and relates to the capacity\nto meet financial obligations in accordance\nwith the documentation governing the relevant\nobligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to\nobligations whose initial maturity is viewed\nas \u201c short-term \u201d based on market convention.\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for\ncorporate, sovereign, and structured\nobligations, and up to 36 months for\nobligations in U.S. public finance markets.\nF1: Highest short-term credit quality.\nIndicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for\ntimely payment of financial commitments; may\nhave an added \u201c + \u201d to denote any\nexceptionally strong credit feature. F2: Good\nshort-term credit quality. Good intrinsic\ncapacity for timely payment of financial\ncommitments. F3: Fair short-term credit\nquality. The intrinsic capacity for timely\npayment of financial commitments is adequate.\nB: Speculative short-term credit quality.\nMinimal capacity for timely payment of\nfinancial commitments, plus heightened\nvulnerability to near term adverse changes in\nfinancial and economic conditions. C: High\nshort-term default risk. Default is a real\npossibility. RD: Restricted default. Indicates\nan entity that has defaulted on one or more of\nits financial commitments, although it\ncontinues to meet other financial obligations.\nTypically applicable to entity ratings only.\nD: Default. Indicates a broad-based default\nevent for an entity, or the default of a\nshort-term obligation. Dominion Bond Rating\nService Limited Long-Term Obligations AAA:\nHighest credit quality. The capacity for the\npayment of financial obligations is\nexceptionally high and unlikely to be\nadversely affected by future events. AA:\nSuperior credit quality. The capacity for the\npayment of financial obligations is considered\nhigh. Credit quality differs from AAA only to\na small degree. Unlikely to be significantly\nvulnerable to future events.\n\nB-5\n\nA: Good credit quality. The capacity for the\npayment of financial obligations is\nsubstantial, but of lesser credit quality than\nAA. May be vulnerable to future events, but\nqualifying negative factors are considered\nmanageable. BBB: Adequate credit quality. The\ncapacity for the payment of financial\nobligations is considered acceptable. May be\nvulnerable to future events. BB: Speculative,\nnon investment-grade credit quality. The\ncapacity for the payment of financial\nobligations is uncertain. Vulnerable to future\nevents. B: Highly speculative credit quality.\nThere is a high level of uncertainty as to the\ncapacity to meet financial obligations. CCC /\nCC / C: Very highly speculative credit\nquality. In danger of defaulting on financial\nobligations. There is little difference\nbetween these three categories, although CC\nand C ratings are normally applied to\nobligations that are seen as highly likely to\ndefault, or subordinated to obligations rated\nin the CCC to B range. Obligations in respect\nof which default has not technically taken\nplace but is considered inevitable may be\nrated in the C category. D: When the issuer\nhas filed under any applicable bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or winding up statute or there is a\nfailure to satisfy an obligation after the\nexhaustion of grace periods, a downgrade to D\nmay occur. Note: All rating categories other\nthan AAA and D also contain subcategories \u201c\n(high) \u201d and \u201c (low) \u201d . The absence of either\na \u201c (high) \u201d or \u201c (low) \u201d designation\nindicates the rating is in the middle of the\ncategory. Commercial Paper and Short-Term Debt\nR-1 (high): Highest credit quality. The\ncapacity for the payment of short-term\nfinancial obligations as they fall due is\nexceptionally high. Unlikely to be adversely\naffected by future events. R-1 (middle):\nSuperior credit quality. The capacity for the\npayment of short-term financial obligations as\nthey fall due is very high. Differs from R-1\n(high) by a relatively modest degree. Unlikely\nto be significantly vulnerable to future\nevents. R-1 (low): Good credit quality. The\ncapacity for the payment of short-term\nfinancial obligations as they fall due is\nsubstantial. Overall strength is not as\nfavorable as higher rating categories. May be\nvulnerable to future events, but qualifying\nnegative factors are considered manageable.\nR-2 (high): Upper end of adequate credit\nquality. The capacity for the payment of\nshort-term financial obligations as they fall\ndue is acceptable. May be vulnerable to future\nevents. R-2 (middle): Adequate credit quality.\nThe capacity for the payment of short-term\nfinancial obligations as they fall due is\nacceptable. May be vulnerable to future events\nor may be exposed to other factors that could\nreduce credit quality. R-2 (low): Lower end of\nadequate credit quality. The capacity for the\npayment of short-term financial obligations as\nthey fall due is acceptable. May be vulnerable\nto future events. A number of challenges are\npresent that could affect the issuer's ability\nto meet such obligations. R-3: Lowest end of\nadequate credit quality. There is a capacity\nfor the payment of short-term financial\nobligations as they fall due. May be\nvulnerable to future events and the certainty\nof meeting such obligations could be impacted\nby a variety of developments. R-4: Speculative\ncredit quality. The capacity for the payment\nof short-term financial obligations as they\nfall due is uncertain. R-5: Highly speculative\ncredit quality. There is a high level of\nuncertainty as to the capacity to meet short-\nterm financial obligations as they fall due.\nD: When the issuer has filed under any\napplicable bankruptcy, insolvency or winding\nup statute or there is a failure to satisfy an\nobligation after the exhaustion of grace\nperiods, a downgrade to D may occur.
