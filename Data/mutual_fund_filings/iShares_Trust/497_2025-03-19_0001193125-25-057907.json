The investment advisory\nagreement between iShares Trust\n(the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock\nFund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d )\nprovides that BFA will pay all\noperating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition\nand disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v)\ndistribution fees or expenses,\nand (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. The\nFund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses reflect\nthe Fund's pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred\nindirectly by the Fund as a\nresult of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact\nof Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses is included in the total\nreturns of the Fund. Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses are not\nincluded in the calculation of\nthe ratio of expenses to average\nnet assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund's\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d\n).BFA, the investment adviser to\nthe Fund, has contractually\nagreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees in an amount\nequal to the Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses, if any,\nattributable to investments by\nthe Fund in other registered\ninvestment companies advised by\nBFA, or its affiliates, through\nJune 30, 2030. The contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to\nJune 30, 2030only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA.\nYou may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries,\nwhich are not reflected in the\ntables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n       Dist\u2026        Acqu\u2026  Tot\u2026  Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  (12b\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Ann\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n                                        Wai\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.00%  0.0\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.0\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA\nunder the Investment Advisory\nAgreement exclude Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any. 2 The\namount rounded to 0.00%. 3 Based\non estimated amounts for the\ncurrent fiscal year.\n\nS-1\n\nExample. This Example is intended\nto help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that\nyou invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated\nand then sell all of your shares\nat the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each\nyear and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs\nmay be higher or lower, based on\nthese assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $9          $29  \n                   \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Because the Fund is\nnew, there is no reportable\nturnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe ICE AMT-Free US Long National\nMunicipal Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of U.S. dollar\ndenominated investment grade tax-\nexempt debt publicly issued in\nthe U.S. domestic market by U.S.\nstates and their political\nsubdivisions. As of March 11,\n2025, a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is\nrepresented by municipal bonds.\nThe components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. The Underlying Index\nincludes municipal bonds, the\ninterest of which is exempt from\nFederal income taxes and not\nsubject to alternative minimum\ntax. Each bond in the Underlying\nIndex must have a rating of at\nleast BBB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s \u00ae\nGlobal Ratings, a subsidiary of\nS&P Global, Baa3 by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., or BBB-\nby Fitch Ratings, Inc. A bond\nmust be rated by at least one of\nthese three rating agencies in\norder to qualify for the\nUnderlying Index, and the lowest\nrating will be used in\ndetermining if the bond is\ninvestment grade. Each bond in\nthe Underlying Index must be a\nconstituent of an offering where\nthe original offering amount was\nat least $50 million and have a\nminimum par amount ( i.e. ,\ncurrently outstanding face value)\nof $10 million. In addition, each\nbond must have a minimum\nremaining term to final maturity\ngreater than or equal to 12\nyears, at least three years\nremaining until the next call\ndate and a fixed coupon schedule\n( i.e. , including zero coupon\nand step-up or stepdown bonds).\nThe Underlying Index is a market-\nvalue weighted index and is\nsubject to a capping methodology\nthat aims at reducing index\nconcentration. The Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced on the last\ncalendar day of the month. BFA\nuses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. The Fund does not try\nto \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary\ndefensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-2\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market value\nand industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability, duration (\ni.e. , a security's price\nsensitivity to a change in\ninterest rates), maturity or\ncredit ratings and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets\nin the component securities of\nthe Underlying Index, and the\nFund will invest at least 90% of\nits assets in fixed income\nsecurities of the types included\nin the Underlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. The Fund\nwill invest no more than 10% of\nits assets in futures, options\nand swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index as well as\nin fixed income securities other\nthan the types included in the\nUnderlying Index, but which BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments\nassociated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part\nof that position for the purposes\nof calculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund will\ngenerally hold municipal bond\nsecurities issued by state and\nlocal municipalities whose\ninterest payments are exempt from\nU.S. federal income taxes and the\nfederal alternative minimum tax (\n\u201c AMT \u201d ). As of the date of this\nProspectus, interest that is\nexempt from U.S. federal income\ntax is also exempt from the\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\nof 3.8% on \u201c net investment\nincome. \u201d In addition, the Fund\nintends to invest any cash assets\nin one or more affiliated\nmunicipal money market funds,\nwhich may be advised by BFA or\nits affiliates. The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe Underlying Index before fees\nand expenses of the Fund. The\nFund may invest in shares of\nother iShares funds that provide\nsubstantially similar exposure to\nthe securities in the Underlying\nIndex. BFA will waive a portion\nof its management fees in an\namount equal to the acquired fund\nfees and expenses, if any,\nattributable to the Fund's\ninvestment in other iShares\nfunds. The Underlying Index is\nsponsored by ICE Data Indices,\nLLC (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nIDI \u201d ), which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group S-3 of\nindustries to approximately the\nsame extent that the Underlying\nIndex is concentrated. For\npurposes of this limitation,\nsecurities of the U.S. government\n(including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities), repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities, and\nsecurities of state or municipal\ngovernments and their political\nsubdivisions are not considered\nto be issued by members of any\nindustry. Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail\nthat of other investments.The\nFund is subject to certain risks,\nincluding the principal risks\nnoted below, any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund's net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d\n), trading price, yield, total\nreturn and ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with\nothers following in alphabetical\norder), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Municipal Securities\nRisk . Municipal securities can\nbe significantly affected by\npolitical or economic changes,\nincluding changes made in the law\nafter issuance of the securities,\nas well as uncertainties in the\nmunicipal market related to\ntaxation, legislative changes or\nthe rights of municipal security\nholders, including in connection\nwith an issuer insolvency.\nMunicipal securities backed by\ncurrent or anticipated revenues\nfrom a specific project or\nspecific assets can be negatively\naffected by the inability to\ncollect revenues from such\nprojects or assets. Certain\nmunicipal securities are issued\nby entities with limited taxing\nauthority such as school\ndistricts, or are dependent on\nrevenue from a particular sector\nor industry, such as the\nutilities sector, infrastructure\nsector, or transportation\nindustry. Risk of Investing in\nthe U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nInterest Rate Risk . Interest\nrate risk refers to the risk of\nfluctuations in the value of a\nfixed-income security due to\nchanges in the general level of\ninterest rates. Interest rate\nchanges can be sudden and\nunpredictable and are influenced\nby a number of factors, including\ngovernment policy, monetary\npolicy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. An increase in\ninterest rates generally will\ncause the value of fixed-income\nsecurities to decline. Securities\nwith longer maturities generally\nare more sensitive to interest\nrate changes and subject to\ngreater fluctuations in value.\nChanges in interest rates may\nhave unpredictable effects on\nfixed-income markets and result\nin heightened volatility and\nlower liquidity for certain\ninstruments, which may adversely\naffect a Fund\u2019s performance.\nDuring periods of very low or\nnegative interest rates, a Fund\nmay be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto shareholders. Market Risk .\nThe Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over S-4\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThe Index Provider may rely on\nvarious sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components\nof the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be\nbased on assumptions and\nestimates. Neither the Fund nor\nBFA can offer assurances that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of\nincluded components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its\ninvestment objective. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or\nthe construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur,\nand the Index Provider may not\nidentify or correct them promptly\nor at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and\nits shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes. Assets\nUnder Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, or another fund\nmay invest in the Fund and hold\nits investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund\nto achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Call Risk . During\nperiods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of a callable\nbond held by the Fund may \u201c call\n\u201d or repay the security before\nits stated S-5 maturity, and the\nFund may have to reinvest the\nproceeds in securities with lower\nyields, which would result in a\ndecline in the Fund's income, or\nin securities with greater risks\nor with other less favorable\nfeatures. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Credit Risk . Debt\nissuers and other counterparties\nmay be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or\notherwise honor their\nobligations. Changes in an\nissuer\u2019s credit rating or the\nmarket\u2019s perception of an\nissuer\u2019s creditworthiness may\nalso adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investment in that\nissuer. The degree of credit risk\ndepends on an issuer's or\ncounterparty's financial\ncondition and on the terms of an\nobligation. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the\nelectronic systems of the Fund,\nits adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or\nissuers of assets in which the\nFund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans and risk management systems\nseeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems. The Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Income\nRisk. The Fund's income may\ndecline if interest rates fall.\nThis decline in income can occur\nbecause the Fund may subsequently\ninvest in lower-yielding bonds as\nbonds in its portfolio mature,\nare near maturity or are called,\nbonds in the Underlying Index are\nsubstituted, or the Fund\notherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not\nfully replicate the Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that the investment\nstrategy of BFA may not produce\nthe intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares\n(including through a trading\nhalt), losses from S-6 trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions\nin the process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk\n. The Fund is classified as \u201c\nnon-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that\nare classified as \u201c diversified,\n\u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of\nissuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to\nthe risks associated with these\nparticular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the\nFund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the\nperformance of a small number of\nissuers or counterparties, which\nmay lead to more volatility in\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but\nnot limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Small Fund\nRisk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience\nlow trading volume and wide\nbid/ask spreads. In addition, the\nFund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. Tax Risk . There is\nno guarantee that the Fund's\nincome will be exempt from U.S.\nfederal income taxes and the\nfederal AMT. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies\nused to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by\nthe Fund that the Underlying\nIndex does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash;\ndifferences in the timing of the\naccrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by\nthe Fund or distributions paid to\nFund shareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index; and impacts to\nthe Fund of complying with\ncertain regulatory requirements\nor limits. S-7 Tracking error\nrisk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other\ndisposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the security\nor other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that\ntrade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using\na fair value methodology. The\nprice received by the Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by\nthe Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when\ninvestors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on\ndays when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other\nassets may receive fewer or more\nshares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they\nwould have received had the\nsecurities or other assets not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the\nProspectus, the Fund has not\ncommenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance\ninformation to report. S-8\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. James Mauro\nand Karen Uyehara (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are\nprimarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the\nFund. Each Portfolio Manager\nsupervises a portfolio management\nteam. Mr. Mauro and Ms. Uyehara\nhave been Portfolio Managers of\nthe Fund since inception (2025).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\nThe Fund is an exchange-traded\nfund (commonly referred to as an\n\u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of\nthe Fund may only be bought and\nsold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because\nETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a\ndiscount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the\ndifference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay\nto purchase shares of the Fund\n(bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when\nbuying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Tax Information The\nFund intends to make\ndistributions primarily from net\ntax-exempt income, although\ndistributions of taxable capital\ngains may also occur. The Fund is\ngenerally not an appropriate\ninvestment for a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA . Please consult your\npersonal tax advisor. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information.

The market\nprice for a share of the Fund may\nbe different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and\nis designed to be used as part of\nbroader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an\ninvestment in the Fund should not\nconstitute a complete investment\nprogram. An investment in the\nFund is not a bank deposit, and\nit is not insured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government\nagency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share\nof the Fund represents an\nownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\n(as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. An index is a financial\ncalculation, based on a grouping\nof financial instruments, and is\nnot an investment product, while\nthe Fund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and that of its Underlying\nIndex may vary for a number of\nreasons, including transaction\ncosts, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions,\ntiming variances and differences\nbetween the composition of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio and that of the\nUnderlying Index resulting from\nthe Fund\u2019s use of representative\nsampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nits Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the provider of the\nUnderlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to\nthe index methodology or other\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s performance on a going-\nforward basis after the\n\n1\n\neffective date of such change.\nTherefore, the performance of the\nUnderlying Index that is shown\nfor periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\ngenerally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to\nreflect the change. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of the\napplicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use\nrepresentative sampling, they can\nbe expected to have a larger\ntracking error than if they used\na replication indexing strategy.\n\u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. 2 Additional Information\nAbout the Fund's Risks Each Fund\nis subject to various risks, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose\nall or part of your investment in\na Fund, which could underperform\nother investments. The principal\nand other (non-principal) risks\nthat apply to the Fund. A Fund\nthat invests in an underlying\nfund ( \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d ) also\nmay be indirectly exposed to\nthese risks through such\ninvestment. Principal Risks Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and\nother assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio or, if applicable, its\nUnderlying Index may underperform\nin comparison to indexes that\ntrack, or assets that represent,\nother countries or geographic\nunits, industries, markets,\nmarket segments, or asset\nclasses. Various types of\nsecurities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause a Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk. From time to time, an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nan affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nor another fund may invest in a\nFund and hold its investment for\na specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or\nscale. There can be no assurance\nthat any such entity would not\nredeem its investment or that the\nsize of the Fund would be\nmaintained at such levels, which\ncould negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Call\nRisk. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, an issuer of a\ncallable bond held by a Fund may\n\u201c call \u201d or repay the security\nbefore its stated maturity, and\nthe Fund may have 3 to reinvest\nthe proceeds in securities with\nlower yields, which would result\nin a decline in the Fund\u2019s\nincome, or in securities with\ngreater risks or with other less\nfavorable features. Concentration\nRisk. A Fund may be susceptible\nto an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse\nevents that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market\nas a whole, to the extent that\nthe Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or\nother assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCredit Risk. Credit risk is the\nrisk that the issuer or guarantor\nof a debt instrument or the\ncounterparty to a derivatives\ncontract, repurchase agreement or\nloan of portfolio securities will\nbe unable or unwilling to make\nits timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or\notherwise honor its obligations.\nThere are varying degrees of\ncredit risk, depending on an\nissuer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial condition and on the\nterms of an obligation, which may\nbe reflected in the issuer\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating.\nThere is the chance that the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings will\nhave their credit ratings\ndowngraded or will default (\ni.e., fail to make scheduled\ninterest or principal payments),\nor that the market\u2019s perception\nof an issuer\u2019s creditworthiness\nmay worsen, potentially reducing\nthe Fund\u2019s income level or share\nprice. Cybersecurity Risk. A Fund\nand entities that interact with\nthe Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security\nand related cybersecurity risks,\nboth directly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with a\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\n4 transactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to a Fund\u2019s\nfunctioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. A Fund\nmay incur substantial costs in\norder to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, a Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could\nbe negatively impacted as a\nresult. Income Risk. The Fund\u2019s\nincome may decline if interest\nrates fall. This decline in\nincome can occur because the Fund\nmay subsequently invest in lower-\nyielding bonds as bonds in its\nportfolio mature, are near\nmaturity or are called, bonds in\nthe Underlying Index are\nsubstituted, or the Fund\notherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds. The Index\nProvider\u2019s substitution of bonds\nin the Underlying Index may\noccur, for example, when the time\nto maturity for the bond no\nlonger matches the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s stated maturity\nguidelines. Index-Related Risk. A\nFund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of its\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither a Fund nor BFA can offer\nassurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the\nFund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of an Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to an Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact a Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and 5 its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact an\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise\nbe removed at the rebalance (due\nto, for example, changes in\nmarket capitalization or issuer\ncredit ratings) may remain,\ncausing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying\nIndex to vary from those expected\nunder normal conditions. In\naddition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between\nperiodic index reviews and\nreconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents\nthat do not align with its\nobjective or selection criteria,\nand the Fund tracking the\nUnderlying Index may be similarly\naffected. In addition to\nscheduled rebalances, an Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The\nrelevant Fund will in turn\nrebalance its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio\nand the Underlying Index. The\nFund and its shareholders will\ndirectly bear any transaction\ncosts and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing.\nTherefore, index-related errors\nand ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and\ntracking error. Interest Rate\nRisk. Interest rate changes can\nbe sudden and unpredictable and\nare influenced by a number of\nfactors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy,\ninflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. Changes in interest\nrates may have unpredictable\neffects on fixed-income markets\nand may result in heightened\nvolatility and lower liquidity\nfor certain instruments, which\nmay adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nperformance. When interest rates\nrise, the value of fixed-income\nsecurities or other instruments\nsensitive to interest rates\ntypically decreases. Duration is\na measure of how sensitive a bond\nis to interest rate changes.\nFixed-income securities with\nlonger durations tend to be more\nsensitive to interest rate\nchanges, and their prices usually\nare more volatile than those of\nshorter-duration securities. For\nexample, if a bond has a duration\nof five years and interest rates\nrise, the price of the bond will\nlikely decline by a greater\npercentage than for a bond with a\none-year duration. To the extent\na Fund invests a substantial\nportion of its assets in fixed-\nincome securities with longer\nduration, rising interest rates\nmay cause the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments to decline\nsignificantly, which would\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. In addition, changes\nin prevailing interest rates,\nparticularly sudden and\nsignificant changes, may lead to\nfluctuations in the value of\nfloating-rate debt securities,\nbecause the rates for those\nsecurities typically reset only\nperiodically. Additionally,\nduring periods of very low or\nnegative interest rates, a Fund\nmay be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto shareholders. Under certain\nmarket conditions when interest\nrates are set at low levels and\nthe market prices of portfolio\nsecurities have increased, a Fund\nmay have a very low or even\nnegative yield, which would cause\nthe Fund to lose money under\ncertain conditions. 6 Decreases\nin market-making capacity for\nfixed-income dealers may lead to\nlower trading volume, heightened\nvolatility, wider bid-ask spreads\nand less transparent pricing in\ncertain fixed-income markets.\nIssuer Risk. The performance of a\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk.\nThe Fund invests in securities or\nother assets included in, or\nrepresentative of, its Underlying\nIndex, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. The Fund may\nbe affected by a general decline\nin market segments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. A Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non a Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nany of which may lead to its\nshares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount\nto NAV or to the intraday value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nIf you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\npremium to NAV or sell Fund\nshares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the\nNAV, you may pay significantly\nmore or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of\nthe Fund shares. Absence of an\nActive Primary Market. Although\nFund shares are listed for\ntrading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary\ntrading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. 7 Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund\u2019s primary listing\nis maintained. Fund shares also\nmay be available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or\nstructured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that a\nFund\u2019s shares will continue to\ntrade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s\nshares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in\nothers, and investors are subject\nto the execution and settlement\nrisks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\nthat is available to investors\nwho trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be\navailable to investors who trade\nin other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\na Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\nSecondary market trading in Fund\nshares may be halted by a stock\nexchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt a\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in a\nFund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, a Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of a Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on a\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of a Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market 8 value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of a Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares\nmay deviate significantly from\nNAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to a Fund\u2019s NAV are not\nlikely to be sustained over the\nlong term (unlike shares of many\nclosed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of a Fund that\ndiffer significantly from its\nNAV. Authorized Participants may\nbe less willing to create or\nredeem a Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares\n(the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price\nat which they are willing to sell\nFund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price).\nThe spread varies over time for\nFund shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity. It\nis generally narrower if a Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Increased\nmarket volatility also may cause\nwider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults, and an investment in\nFund shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Municipal Securities\nRisk. Municipal securities\ninclude both general obligation\nbonds (bonds secured by the full\nfaith and credit of the issuer)\nand limited obligation bonds (or\n\u201c Revenue Bonds \u201d ). All\nmunicipal securities are subject\nto the risk that litigation,\nlegislation or other political\nevents, local business or\neconomic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, or the\nbankruptcy of the issuer could\nhave a significant effect on an\nissuer\u2019s ability to make payments\nof principal and/or interest or\notherwise affect the value of\nsuch securities. Additionally,\ncertain municipal securities may\nbe issued by entities with\nlimited taxing authority, which\ncould limit or prevent tax\nincreases necessary to make\ncontinued payments of principal\nand interest. Municipal\nsecurities can be significantly\naffected by political or economic\nchanges, including changes made\nin the law after issuance of the\nsecurities, as well as 9\nuncertainties in the municipal\nmarket related to taxation,\nlegislative changes or the rights\nof municipal security holders,\nincluding in connection with an\nissuer insolvency. There is also\nthe risk that corruption may\nnegatively affect municipal\nissuers, including corruption\nrelated to a particular project\nfrom which payments on a security\nare derived, resulting in delays\nand cost overruns. There may be\nless publicly available\ninformation on the financial\ncondition of municipal security\nissuers than for issuers of other\nsecurities. As a result,\nmunicipal securities may be more\ndifficult for the Fund to value\naccurately than the securities of\npublic companies. Municipal\nsecurities may also be harder to\nbuy and sell compared to taxable\nbonds and non-municipal\nsecurities, especially on short\nnotice. If a Fund invests a\nsignificant portion of its\nportfolio in municipal\nsecurities, the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nis subject to greater exposure to\nilliquidity risk than a fund that\ninvests in comparable taxable\nbonds or non-municipal\nsecurities. A Fund and BFA will\nrely on the opinion of issuers\u2019\nbond counsel on the tax-exempt\nstatus of interest on municipal\nbonds. Neither the Fund nor BFA\nwill independently review the\nbases for those tax opinions,\nwhich may ultimately be\ndetermined to be incorrect,\npotentially resulting in the Fund\nand its shareholders being\nsubject to substantial tax\nliabilities. In addition, changes\nin the financial condition of an\nindividual municipal issuer can\naffect the overall municipal\nmarket. Revenue Bonds are backed\nby current or anticipated\nrevenues from a specific project\nor specific assets and can be\nnegatively affected by the\ndiscontinuance of the tax\nbenefits supporting the project\nor assets or the inability to\ncollect revenues from the project\nor the assets. Additionally, the\nmarket values of Revenue Bonds\nmay decline in times of higher\ninflation to the extent that\nrevenues are fixed income\nstreams. In other instances, the\nprices that an issuer is able to\ncharge users of its assets may be\nlinked to inflation, whether by\ngovernment regulation,\ncontractual arrangement or other\nfactors. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of\ncapital for certain issuers,\nwhich could negatively impact\ntheir ability to meet payment\nobligations. In this case,\nchanges in the rate of inflation\nmay affect the issuer\u2019s revenues.\nBecause many municipal securities\nare issued to finance projects,\nsuch as those related to\neducation, health care, housing,\ntransportation, utilities, and\nwater and sewer, conditions in\none or more of these sectors can\naffect the overall municipal\nmarket. Adverse conditions and\ndevelopments affecting a\nparticular project can result in\nlower revenues to an issuer of\nthe municipal securities and, by\nextension, adversely affect\npayments of principal and\ninterest on, or the market value\nof, such securities.\nAdditionally, certain municipal\nsecurities are issued by entities\ndependent on revenue from a\nparticular sector and thus are\nsubject to the specific risks\nassociated with that sector. Risk\nof Investing in Infrastructure-\nRelated Municipal Securities.\nEntities that issue municipal\nsecurities related to\ninfrastructure ( \u201c infrastructure\nissuers \u201d ) may be subject to a\nvariety of factors that could\nadversely affect their capacity\nto make principal and interest\npayments, such as high interest\ncosts in connection with capital\nconstruction programs, high\ndegrees of leverage, costs\nassociated with governmental,\nenvironmental and other\nregulations, the effects of\neconomic slowdowns, increased\ncompetition from other providers\nof services, uncertainties\nconcerning costs, the level 10 of\ngovernment spending on\ninfrastructure projects, and\nother factors. Such issuers may\nbe adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility,\nchanges in exchange rates, import\ncontrols, depletion of resources,\ntechnological developments, and\nlabor relations. Infrastructure\nissuers can be significantly\naffected by government spending\npolicies. Leverage Risk.\nInfrastructure issuers can be\nhighly indebted, which increases\ninvestment risk and other risks\nnormally associated with debt\nfinancing, which could adversely\naffect such an issuer\u2019s\noperations and the market value\nof related municipal securities\nin periods of rising interest\nrates. Operations Risk. The\nfailure of an infrastructure\nissuer to carry adequate\ninsurance or to operate its\nassets appropriately could lead\nto significant losses.\nInfrastructure may be adversely\naffected by environmental clean-\nup costs and catastrophic events\nsuch as earthquakes, hurricanes\nand terrorist acts. Regulatory\nRisk. Infrastructure projects may\nbe subject to significant\nregulation by various\ngovernmental authorities and also\nmay be affected by regulation of\nrates charged to customers,\nservice interruption due to\nenvironmental, operational or\nother events, the imposition of\nspecial tariffs and changes in\ntax laws, regulatory policies and\naccounting standards. Strategic\nAsset Risk. Infrastructure\nissuers may control significant\nstrategic assets ( e.g., major\npipelines or highways), which are\nassets that have a national or\nregional profile, and may have\nmonopolistic characteristics.\nGiven their national or regional\nprofile or irreplaceable nature,\nstrategic assets could generate\nadditional risk not common in\nother industry sectors and they\nmay be targeted for terrorist\nacts or adverse political\nactions. User Risk.\nInfrastructure issuers can be\ndependent upon a narrow user\nbase. If these users do not\npatronize infrastructure projects\nas expected, significant revenues\ncould be lost and may not be\nreplaceable, in which case\ninfrastructure issuers may fail\nto pay their obligations. Risk of\nInvesting in Municipal Securities\nIssued By School Districts.\nSchool districts rely, in part,\non funding appropriations from,\namong others, the federal\ngovernment and state governments.\nAs a result, municipal securities\nissued by school districts may be\nadversely affected by political\nand economic changes at the state\nor federal levels, such as\ndecreased tax or other revenues,\nspending reductions or changes in\nappropriations. Municipal\nsecurities that are issued to\nfinance a particular school\ndistrict project often depend on\nrevenues from ad valorem taxes\n(i.e., property taxes) to make\nprincipal and interest payments.\nInvestors in these securities,\nsimilar to investors in municipal\nsecurities generally, face\nheightened risk of loss upon\ninsolvency of the school district\nissuers because there is often no\nready source of funding to pay\nprincipal and interest other than\nthe local tax base, which a\nbankruptcy court or administrator\ndoes not control. Risk of\nInvesting in Transportation\nInfrastructure-Related Municipal\nSecurities. The transportation\ninfrastructure industry may be\nadversely affected by economic\nchanges, increases in fuel and\nother operating costs, labor\nrelations, insurance costs, and,\nin many jurisdictions, the\neffects of regulatory changes or\nother government decisions. 11\nMunicipal securities that are\nissued to finance a particular\ntransportation project (e.g.,\ntoll roads) often depend on\nrevenues from that project to\nmake principal and interest\npayments. Risk of Investing in\nUtility-Related Municipal\nSecurities. Certain municipal\nsecurities are issued by public\nbodies, including state and\nmunicipal utility authorities,\nto, among other things, finance\nthe operation or expansion of\nutility entities. Various future\neconomic and other conditions may\nadversely affect utility\nentities, including inflation,\nincreases in financing\nrequirements, increases in raw\nmaterial costs and other\noperating costs, changes in\ndemand for services and the\neffects of environmental and\nother governmental regulations.\nCertain utilities are subject to\nspecific risks. For example, gas\nutilities are subject to risks of\nsupply conditions and increased\ncompetition from other providers\nof utility services. In addition,\ngas utilities are affected by gas\nprices, which may be magnified to\nthe extent that a gas utility\nenters into long-term contracts\nfor the purchase or sale of gas\nat a fixed price, since such\nprices may change significantly\nand to the disadvantage of the\ngas utility. Non-Diversification\nRisk. A Fund that is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified \u201d may invest\na greater percentage of its\nassets in securities or other\ninstruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with\nfunds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified\nFund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have\na greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the\nperformance of a diversified\nFund, and a non-diversified\nFund\u2019s NAV may be more volatile.\nOperational Risk. Each Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. Each Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. Investing\nin U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other\nrisks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also\nsubject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods.\nU.S. security risks include acts\nof terrorism, internal unrest and\na deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt 12 ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Small\nFund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience\nlow trading volume and wide\nbid/ask spreads. In addition, a\nFund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. If a Fund were\nrequired to delist from the\nlisting exchange, the Fund\u2019s\nvalue may rapidly decline and its\nperformance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. Tax Risk. There is\nno guarantee that a Fund\u2019s income\nwill be exempt from U.S. federal\nincome taxes and the federal AMT.\nThe Index Provider relies on the\nbond issuer\u2019s prospectus\ndisclosure of the opinion from\nits counsel as to the tax-exempt\nstatus of the investment.\nSimilarly, for municipal bonds\nnot represented in an Underlying\nIndex, BFA relies on prospectus\ndisclosure of the tax opinion\nfrom the bond issuer\u2019s counsel.\nNeither BFA nor a Fund guarantees\nthat these opinions are correct,\nand there is no assurance that\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) will agree with the\nbond issuer\u2019s counsel\u2019s tax\nopinion. Issuers or other parties\ngenerally enter into covenants\nrequiring continuing compliance\nwith U.S. federal tax\nrequirements to preserve the tax-\nfree status of interest payments\nover the life of the security. If\nat any time the covenants are not\ncomplied with, or if the IRS\notherwise determines that the\nissuer did not comply with\nrelevant tax requirements,\ninterest payments from a security\ncould become federally taxable,\npossibly retroactively to the\ndate the security was issued, and\nthe security could decline\nsignificantly in value. For\nmunicipal bonds not included in\nan Underlying Index, BFA will\ngenerally seek to obtain bonds\nthat pay interest that is exempt\nfrom U.S. federal income taxes\nand the federal AMT. The interest\non any money market instruments\nor other cash equivalents and any\nderivatives held by a Fund may be\nsubject to federal, state and\nlocal income taxation and the\nfederal Medicare contribution\ntax. Events occurring after the\ndate of issuance of a municipal\nbond or after a Fund\u2019s\nacquisition of a municipal bond\nmay result in a determination\nthat interest on that bond is\nincludible in gross income for\nU.S. federal, state and local\nincome tax, federal AMT or\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\npurposes retroactively to its\ndate of issuance. Such a\ndetermination may cause a portion\nof prior distributions by the\nFund to its shareholders to be\ntaxable to those shareholders in\nthe year of receipt. U.S. federal\nor state changes in income,\nfederal AMT or federal Medicare\ncontribution tax rates or in the\ntax treatment of municipal bonds\nmay make municipal bonds less\nattractive as investments and\ncause them to lose value.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that\ntracks an index is subject to the\nrisk of \u201c tracking error, \u201d which\nis the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nand those included in the\nUnderlying Index; differences in\nthe timing and methodologies used\nto value securities and other\nassets; transaction costs and\nother expenses incurred by a Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest 13 received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for a\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index, such as during\na rebalancing or reconstitution;\nand impacts to a Fund of\ncomplying with certain regulatory\nrequirements or limits. A Fund\nthat tracks an index composed of\na large number of securities or\nother assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a\nFund that tracks a more narrow\nindex. Tracking error risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nValuation Risk. The price that a\nFund could receive upon the sale\n(or other disposition) of a\nsecurity or other asset may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology. The price\nreceived by a Fund also may\ndiffer from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable).\nBecause non-U.S. exchanges or\nmarkets may be open on days or\nduring time periods when a Fund\ndoes not price its shares, the\nvalue of the securities or other\nassets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio may\nchange on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not\nable to purchase or sell Fund\nshares. In addition, for purposes\nof calculating a Fund\u2019s NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies (if any) is\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates. For\na Fund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex, this may result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized\nParticipants that create or\nredeem Fund shares on days when a\nFund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or\nlower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued\nor been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value\ninvestments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by\npricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Other\nRisks The order of the below risk\nfactors does not indicate the\nsignificance of any particular\nrisk factor. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts.\nRegulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of\nU.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. 14\nIlliquid Investments Risk. An\nilliquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or\ndisposed of in current market\nconditions in seven calendar days\nor less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the\ninvestment. An investment may be\nilliquid due to, among other\nthings, fewer participants or\nless capacity to make a market in\nthe investment, the lack of an\nactive market for the investment,\ncapital controls, delays or\nlimits on repatriation of local\ncurrency, and the insolvency of\nlocal governments. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities\nor other assets with substantial\nmarket and/or credit risk, the\nFund will tend to have increased\nexposure to the risks associated\nwith illiquid investments.\nIlliquid investments may be\nharder to value, especially in\nchanging markets. Liquid\ninvestments may become illiquid\nafter purchase by a Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by a Fund, and any\nsecurity or other asset held by a\nFund may be deemed an illiquid\ninvestment pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk management\nprogram. Holdings of illiquid\ninvestments may reduce a Fund\u2019s\nreturns because the Fund may be\nunable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. If\na Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced\nprices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption\nrequests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This\nmay be magnified in a rising\ninterest rate environment or\nother circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be\ngreater than normal. If other\nmarket participants attempt to\nliquidate holdings at the same\ntime as a Fund, this will lead to\nan increased supply of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests, and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for a Fund\u2019s shares may be\nimpacted by the liquidity in the\nmarket for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held\nby the Fund, which could lead to\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Large Shareholder and Large-\nScale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of a Fund, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of\ntime. These shareholders may also\npledge or loan Fund shares (to\nsecure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares\nbecoming concentrated in another\nparty. There can be no assurance\nthat any large shareholder or\nlarge group of shareholders would\nnot redeem their investment or\nthat the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent a Fund permits redemptions\nin cash, these redemptions may\nforce the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when\nit might not otherwise do so,\nwhich may negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares, increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income\nand/or capital 15 gains, and\ncause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such tax year. A Fund\nalso may be required to sell its\nmore liquid investments to meet a\nlarge redemption, in which case\nthe Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile,\nand more difficult to price. To\nthe extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nOwnership Limitations Risk. If\ncertain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor a Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including a Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by law,\nregulation or rules or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of a Fund\nto invest in certain securities\nor other assets may be affected\nby the relevant threshold limits,\nand such limitations may have\nadverse effects on the liquidity\nand performance of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. For example,\nownership limits may apply to\nsecurities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries\nor in certain international\nmarkets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity\n(such as a Fund) is subject to\ncorporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions or invests in\ncertain futures or other\nderivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for client funds and\naccounts managed by BFA\n(including a Fund) may not exceed\nthe relevant limits without the\ngrant of a license or other\nregulatory or corporate approval,\norder, consent, relief or non-\ndisapproval. However, there is no\nguarantee that permission will be\ngranted or that, once granted, it\nwill not be modified or revoked\nat a later date with minimal or\nno notice. In other cases,\nexceeding such thresholds may\ncause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to\nsuffer disadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Ownership\nlimitations are highly complex.\nIt is possible that, despite\nBFA\u2019s intent to either comply\nwith or be granted permission to\nexceed ownership limitations, it\nmay inadvertently breach a limit\nor violate the corporate or\nregulatory approval, order,\nconsent, relief or non-\ndisapproval that was obtained.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A\ndescription of the policies and\nprocedures with respect to the\ndisclosure of the Funds\u2019\nportfolio securities and other\nassets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each\nFund\u2019s top 16 holdings are posted\non www.iShares.com when available\nand may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement of the Fund Investment\nAdviser As investment adviser,\nBFA has overall responsibility\nfor the general management and\nadministration of the Funds. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the\ninvestment of the Funds\u2019 assets.\nIn seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives,\nBFA uses teams of portfolio\nmanagers, investment strategists\nand other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading,\nresearch and expertise of its\naffiliates. This team approach\nbrings together many disciplines\nand leverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. BFA is an indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand is located at 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105.\nAs of December 31, 2024, BFA and\nits affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.6\ntrillion. From time to time, an\nemployee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular\nsecurity or other instrument,\nasset class, company, industry,\nor market sector. Such views are\nthe views of only that individual\nas of the time expressed. They do\nnot necessarily represent the\nviews of BlackRock or any other\nperson within the BlackRock\norganization. Such views may\nchange at any time based upon\nmarket or other conditions, and\nBlackRock has no responsibility\nto update such views. You should\nnot rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an\nindication of trading intent on\nbehalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFunds), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c\nBoard \u201d ) of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA will\nbe available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filed with the SEC for the\nperiod ending August 31, 2025 and\nin the applicable financial\nstatements and additional\ninformation documents posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its\ninvestment advisory services to\nthe Fund, BFA is paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund\u2019s\naverage daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate set forth in the\ntable below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees\nfor a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be 17\n\nterminated prior to its\nexpiration date only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA.\nIn addition, BFA may from time to\ntime voluntarily waive and/or\nreimburse fees or expenses to\nreduce a Fund\u2019s total annual fund\noperating expenses (excluding\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be\neliminated by BFA at any time.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Long-Term National  0.09%1          \n  Muni BondETF                                \n                                              \n1 BFA has contractually agreed to\nwaive a portion of its management\nfees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to\ninvestments by the Fund in other\nregistered investment companies\nadvised by BFA, or its\naffiliates, through June 30,\n2030. The contractual waiver may\nbe terminated prior to June 30,\n2030 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. Portfolio\nManagers The Portfolio Managers\nfor the Fund are responsible for\nvarious functions related to\nportfolio management, including,\nbut not limited to, investing\ncash inflows, coordinating with\nmembers of their respective\nportfolio management teams to\nfocus on certain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more\nlimited responsibilities. James\nMauro and Karen Uyehara are\nprimarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the\nFund. James Mauro has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a portfolio manager since\n2011. He is a Managing Director\nof BlackRock, Inc. Karen Uyehara\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a portfolio manager\nsince 2010. She is a Managing\nDirector of BlackRock, Inc.

BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and in the\nordinary course of business may\nengage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof other clients may conflict\nwith those of a Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider,\ninvestment manager, commodity\npool operator, commodity trading\nadvisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal.\nBFA and its Affiliates may have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in\nwhich a Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise\naccounts and other funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or\nthat engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or\nsimilar types of securities,\ncurrencies and other assets as\nare held by a Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies, including investment\ncompanies that are affiliated\nwith the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nits Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a\nFund. These activities may result\nin BFA or an Affiliate having\npositions in assets that are\nsenior or junior to, or that have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the assets held by a\nFund. A Fund may invest in\nsecurities issued by, or engage\nin other transactions with,\nentities with which an Affiliate\nhas significant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances\n(such as debt offerings or\nstructured notes) for which an\nAffiliate is compensated for\nproviding advisory, cash\nmanagement or other services. A\nFund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides or\nmay provide research coverage or\nother analysis. An Affiliate may\nhave business relationships with,\nand receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend a Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for a Fund. Neither BlackRock\nnor any Affiliate is under any\nobligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with a Fund. As a\nresult, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate\ninvestment opportunities. The\nresults of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of\nother accounts managed by an\nAffiliate. It is possible that a\nFund could sustain losses during\nperiods in which one or more\nAffiliates and other accounts\nachieve profits on their trading\nfor proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, a\nFund may enter into transactions\nin which BFA or an Affiliate or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. A Fund may be\nadversely impacted by the effects\nof transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their\ndirectors, officers, employees or\nclients. 19 From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and\naccounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of a\nFund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients. A Fund\u2019s\nactivities may be limited because\nof regulatory restrictions\napplicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to\ncomply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to\nthe extent that they participate\nin the securities lending\nprogram. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s\nlending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received\nas collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the\nentities to which a Fund may lend\nits portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement,\ncertain Funds have retained\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of\nthe standard transaction fee\nreceived from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or\nredemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock\ncollaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services\nplatform. Citibank may have, or\nfrom time to time may develop,\nadditional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates. BlackRock and\nits Affiliates may benefit from a\nFund using a BlackRock index by\ncreating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indexes.\nBlackRock and its Affiliates are\nnot obligated to license an index\nto a Fund, and no Fund is under\nan obligation to use a BlackRock\nindex. The terms of a Fund\u2019s\nindex licensing agreement with\nBlackRock or its Affiliates may\nnot be as favorable as the terms\noffered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts\nof interest that could\ndisadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see\nthe SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and\nSelling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the\nprimary market and the secondary\nmarket. Primary market\ntransactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d\noccur 20 only between the Funds\nand Authorized Participants ( i.e\n., financial institutions that\nare authorized to participate in\nsuch transactions), as described\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges, where they\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices,\nlike shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares\nmay also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on\nnon-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose\nany minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. Buying or selling Fund\nshares on an exchange or other\nsecondary market generally\ninvolves two types of costs that\nare common in securities\ntransactions. First, when buying\nor selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The\ncommission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant\nproportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread\nvaries over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity. Generally, the spread\nis smaller if a Fund has high\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity, and larger if a Fund\nhas lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is\noften the case for newly launched\nor smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread\nmay also be impacted by the\nliquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or\nother assets held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S.\nnational securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open\nfor trading Monday through Friday\nand are closed on weekends and\nthe following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed):\nNew Year\u2019s Day, Martin Luther\nKing, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day,\nGood Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day,\nLabor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. Investments in\nInvestment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing,\nregistered investment companies\nare permitted to invest in a Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to\ncertain terms and conditions set\nforth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an\ninvestment in an Acquired Fund, a\nregistered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter\ninto an agreement with the Trust.\nIf an Acquired Fund invests\nsignificantly 21 in other\nregistered investment companies\nin reliance on Rule 12d1-4, an\nAcquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4\nand invest in the Fund beyond the\nSection 12(d)(1) limits. Any\ninvestment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies\nare permitted to invest in a Fund\nonly up to the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action\nrelief. Book Entry Shares of the\nFunds are held in book-entry\nform, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The\nDepository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC\n\u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares\nof the Funds, or its nominee is\nthe record owner of, and holds\nlegal title to, all outstanding\nshares of the Funds. Investors\nowning Fund shares are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of Fund\nshares, you are not entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of\nstock certificates or to have\nshares registered in your name,\nand you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares.\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of Fund shares, you\nmust rely upon the procedures of\nDTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or\n\u201c street name \u201d form. Share\nPrices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary\nmarket generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected\nby various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF\nshares and the securities or\nother assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic\nconditions. Determination of Net\nAsset Value The NAV of a Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each\nday that the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is\ndetermined as of the close of the\nNYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,\nbased on prices at the time of\nclosing. Any Fund assets or\nliabilities that are denominated\nin currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of a\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net\nassets ( i.e ., the value of its\ntotal assets, including the value\nof any underlying fund shares in\nwhich the Fund invests, less\ntotal liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of\nthe Fund, generally rounded to\nthe nearest cent. The value of a\nFund\u2019s assets and liabilities is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity\ninstruments for which market\nquotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which\nis generally determined using the\nlast 22 reported official closing\nprice or, if a reported closing\nprice is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or\nmarket on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nthat are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs\nand closed-end funds that trade\non exchanges are valued at their\nmost recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are\nvalued using last available bid\nprices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated\nprices) supplied by the Funds\u2019\napproved independent third-party\npricing services, each in\naccordance with BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. Pricing\nservices may use matrix pricing\nor valuation models that utilize\ncertain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations\nwith 60 days or less remaining to\nmaturity unless BFA determines in\ngood faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value.\nGenerally, trading in certain\ninstruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market\ninstruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such\ninstruments used in computing a\nFund\u2019s NAV are determined as of\nsuch times. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. Customized\nexchange-traded equity options\nmay be valued using a\nmathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market\ndata factors. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue a Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. Fair value represents\na good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability.\nIt is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of\nan asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. BFA may\nconclude that a market quotation\nis not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons; \u25a0 A market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or\nliability is thinly traded; \u25a0\nThere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation; or 23 \u25a0 The\ntrading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities.\nValuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing may\nresult in prices that differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nfor which the particular fair\nvalues were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value\nprices and current market\nvaluations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in\nturn, result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its\nunderlying index. Dividends and\nDistributions General Policies. A\nFund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment\nincome, if any, at least once a\nyear. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if\nany, generally are declared and\npaid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for a Fund. The\nTrust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid the\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on Fund\nshares are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof the shares. Dividend payments\nand other distributions are made\nthrough DTC participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFunds. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment\nProgram available to beneficial\nowners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact\ntheir broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation. Brokers may\nrequire beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If the program is\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole Fund shares\npurchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in a Fund. This\ninformation is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and\nlocal taxation on Fund\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares. Distributions that are\nattributable to interest from\nU.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from\ncertain state and local tax.\nConsult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in\nFund shares under all applicable\ntax laws. 24 Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\na Fund will be taxed, including\npossible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when\nyou sell Fund shares. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund.\nThere is no guarantee that shares\nof a Fund will receive certain\nregulatory or accounting\ntreatment. Taxes on Fund\nDistributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information\nafter the end of each calendar\nyear setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital\ngains distributed to them by the\nFund during the prior year, if\nany. Likewise, the amount of tax-\nexempt income, if any, that a\nFund distributes will be\nreported. Such income must be\nreported on the shareholder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax return.\nIn general, distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. Capital Gains.\nDistributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income or from\nnet tax-exempt income, if any),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of a Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gains, if any,\nare taxable to you as ordinary\nincome. Distributions by a Fund\nof net long-term capital gains,\nif any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain\ndividends) are taxable to you as\nlong-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have\nheld the Fund\u2019s shares. Long-term\ncapital gains and qualified\ndividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at\npreferential rates for non-\ncorporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may\napply depending on the type of\ncapital gains, such as Fund\ndistributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ),\nif any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of\nthe distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return\nof capital distribution generally\nwill not be taxable but will\nreduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher\ncapital gain or lower capital\nloss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are\nsold. Once a shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income, if any, are\ntaxable to you at long-term\ncapital gain rates. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income\nto you if they are attributable\nto qualified dividend income\nreceived by a Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\nstock issued by taxable U.S.\ncorporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided\nthat the Fund satisfies certain\nholding period requirements and\nhas not 25 hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways. For\nthis purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any\nnon-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a\ncomprehensive income tax treaty\nwith the U.S., which includes an\nexchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to\nwhich the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities\nmarket. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company.\nDividends received by a Fund from\na RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent that such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from\na REIT, if any, and distributed\nto a shareholder generally will\nbe taxable to the shareholder as\nordinary income. However, for tax\nyears beginning after December\n31, 2017 and before January 1,\n2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified\nbusiness income \u201d deduction for\nnon-corporate U.S. shareholders\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary\nREIT dividends, reduced by\nallocable Fund expenses. For a\ndividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the\ndividend must be received with\nrespect to a share of stock held\nwithout being hedged by the\nrelevant Fund, and with respect\nto a share of the Fund held\nwithout being hedged by you, for\n61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning at the date that is 60\ndays before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividend or,\nin the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day\nperiod beginning 90 days before\nsuch date. Fund distributions, to\nthe extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations,\nwill be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction for\nFund shareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nSubstitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends\npaid on securities lent out, if\nany, will not be qualified\ndividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on \u201c\nnet investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net\ngain, of U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding $200,000 (or\n$250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax.\nThe AMT is a separate U.S.\nfederal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular\nfederal income tax system but\neliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different\ntax rates and treats as taxable\ncertain types of income that are\nnontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on\ncertain \u201c private activity \u201d\nmunicipal bonds. If a taxpayer\u2019s\noverall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax\nliability, then the taxpayer owes\nthe regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the\nAMT liability and the regular\nincome tax liability. Original\nIssue Discount and Inflation-\nRelated Adjustments Accruals of \u201c\noriginal issue discount \u201d on\nbonds that a Fund acquires at a\ndiscount and adjustments for\ninflation to the principal amount\nof an inflation-protected U.S.\nTreasury bond held by a Fund may\nbe included for tax purposes in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income, even\nthough no cash attributable to\nsuch gross income has at that\npoint been received by the Fund.\nIn such event, the Fund may be\nrequired to make annual\ndistributions to 26 shareholders\nthat exceed the cash it has\notherwise received. In order to\npay such distributions, the Fund\nmay be required to raise cash by\nselling portfolio investments.\nThe sale of such investments\ncould result in capital gains to\nthe Fund and additional capital\ngains distributions to Fund\nshareholders. In addition, any\ndeflation-related adjustments\nduring the taxable year to an\ninflation-indexed bond held by a\nFund may cause amounts\ndistributed in the taxable year\nas income to be characterized as\na return of capital. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market\ndiscount recognized on a bond,\nincluding a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary\nincome. A market discount bond is\na bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below\nredemption value or adjusted\nissue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the\nextent that a Fund does not\ninclude the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on\nthe Fund\u2019s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as\nordinary income rather than\ncapital gains to the extent of\nthe accrued market discount.\nDerivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in\nderivatives and other complex\ninstruments, and such investments\nmay be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules\ncould affect whether gains and\nlosses recognized by a Fund are\ntreated as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund\nor defer a Fund\u2019s ability to\nrecognize losses. In addition,\nthese rules may affect the\namount, timing or character of\nincome distributed to you by a\nFund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules.\nNon-U.S. Income Taxes Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains (if\nany) earned by a Fund with\nrespect to securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If, at the close of a\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of non-U.S.\nstocks or securities (generally,\nfor this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated\nas \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ), generally the\nFund may \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes,\nincluding withholding taxes, paid\nby the Fund. This means that you\nwould be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not\npass through non-U.S. taxes, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign\ntaxes that it incurs. Under\ncertain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign\ntaxes paid with respect to a\nprior year, the value of Fund\nshares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions\npassed through to shareholders\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s\nforeign taxes for the current\nyear could be reduced. 27 If, at\nthe close of the year, more than\n50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers,\nincluding depositary receipts (no\nmatter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of\neach quarter, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of\nshares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its\nassets meet these requirements,\nthe Underlying Fund. For purposes\nof foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nNon-U.S. Shareholders If you are\nneither a resident nor a citizen\nof the U.S. or if you are a\nnon-U.S. entity (other than a\npass-through entity to the extent\nowned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which\ninclude distributions of net\nshort-term capital gains), if\nany, generally will be subject to\na 30% U.S. federal withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies. However, withholding tax\ngenerally will not apply to any\ngain or income realized by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder with respect\nto any distribution of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares.\nSeparately, a 30% withholding tax\nmay be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to\ncertain foreign entities, unless\nsuch entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive\nreporting and withholding\nrequirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the\nTreasury of U.S.-owned foreign\ninvestment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident\nor a citizen of the U.S. and you\nhave not provided a taxpayer\nidentification number or social\nsecurity number and made other\nrequired certifications, by law,\nbackup withholding at a 24% rate\nwill apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities\nLending If your shares of a Fund\nare loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends that are paid\nwhile the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend\nincome, and you may lose the\nability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund. Fund of Funds If a Fund\ninvests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned\nby the Underlying Fund, if any,\nwill be ordinary income when\ndistributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s\ncapital losses. To the extent\nsuch Fund is expected to invest\nin an Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nrealized losses on sales of\nshares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently\ndeferred as \u201c wash sales. \u201d\nCapital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not\noffset net capital gains of the\nFund. 28 Taxes on the Sale of\nExchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the\nshares have been held for more\nthan one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares that have been held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as a short-term capital\ngain or loss. However, any\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nshares held for six months or\nless is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that\ncapital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any\nsuch capital gains, including\nfrom sales of Fund shares or from\ncapital gain dividends, are\nincluded in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior\nto being traded in the secondary\nmarket, Fund shares are \u201c created\n\u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other\nfinancial institutions) in block-\nsize Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created\nor redeemed only in Creation\nUnits, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds.\nEach Authorized Participant is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC and has entered into a\nwritten agreement with the Funds\u2019\nDistributor, an affiliate of BFA.\nThe agreement allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place\norders for the purchase and\nredemption of Creation Units.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFunds. Creation transactions are\nsubject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant\nFund. Generally, there are three\ntransaction methods for creating\nand redeeming Fund shares: in-\nkind securities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ),\npartial cash and all cash. In-\nKind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a \u201c creation\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified\nnumber of Creation Units in\nreturn. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a \u201c redemption\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. Partial Cash .\nIn a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\ninto a Fund a creation basket and\na cash amount, including cash\nthat replaces a security or other\nasset in the creation basket, in\nexchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\nCreation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a\nredemption basket and a cash\namount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other\nasset in the redemption basket.\nAll Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund\nan amount of cash specified by\nthe Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a specified amount\nof cash. 29\n\nThe creation and redemption\nbaskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares\nETFs accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d\nMore information about custom\nbaskets is provided in the Funds\u2019\nSAI. Each Fund generally engages\nin creation and redemption\ntransactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table\nbelow. In certain circumstances,\nhowever, a Fund may use another\ntransaction method ( e.g. , an\nin-kind Fund may transact\npartially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Long-Term                                   \n  National             \u2713                      \n  MuniBond                                    \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations\nand redemptions occur are based\non the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is tendered in\nan acceptable form under the\nAuthorized Participant\nagreement. In the event of a\nsystem failure or other\ninterruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants,\ncreation and redemption orders\nmay not be executed according\nto a Fund\u2019s instructions or may\nnot be executed at all.\nAdditional information about\nthe creation and redemption of\nCreation Units (including the\ncut-off times for the receipt\nof creation and redemption\norders) is included in the\nFunds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt\npolicies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent or monitor\nfor frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\nbecause each Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for\ncash, with a deadline for\nplacing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Funds\nhave taken certain measures (\ne.g. , imposing transaction\nfees on purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units\nand reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation\nUnits under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution\nto the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in\nFund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does\nnot involve the Funds directly,\nand such trading is unlikely to\ncause many of the harmful\neffects of frequent cash\npurchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. To the extent a\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends\nto comply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions\nthat would be exempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in\nRule 144A under the 1933 Act,\nwill not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible\nfor resale under Rule 144A.\n\n30\n\nBecause Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an\nongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their\npart may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the\n1933 Act. Any determination of\nwhether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the\nrelevant facts and\ncircumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d\nbut are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to\nordinary secondary\ntransactions), and thus dealing\nwith shares that are part of an\n\u201c unsold allotment \u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus\ndelivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available\nonly with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding Householding is an\noption available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is\na method of delivery, based on\nthe preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a\nsingle copy of certain\nshareholder documents can be\ndelivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if\nyou are interested in enrolling\nin householding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled\nin householding and wish to\nchange your householding\nstatus. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent\ndistributes Creation Units for\nthe Funds on an agency basis.\nThe Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Funds. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or\nother assets (as applicable)\nthat are purchased or sold by\nthe Funds. The Distributor\u2019s\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. BFA\nor its affiliates make payments\nto broker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together,\n\u201c intermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting\nsystems, data provision\nservices, or their making\nshares of the Funds available\nto their customers generally\nand in certain investment\nprograms. Such payments, which\nmay be significant to the\nintermediary, are not made by\nthe Funds. Rather, such\npayments are made by BFA or its\naffiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly\nor indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Funds. Payments of\nthis type are sometimes\nreferred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options\nit recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of\nservices provided, to its\ncustomers based on the payments\nor other financial incentives\nthe intermediary is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such\npayments or other financial\nincentives that are offered or\nmade to an intermediary create\nconflicts of interest 31\nbetween the intermediary and\nits customers and may cause the\nintermediary to recommend the\nFunds over another investment.\nMore information regarding\nthese payments is contained in\nthe applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or\nother investment professional\nfor more information regarding\nany such payments that their\nfirm may receive from BFA or\nits affiliates.
