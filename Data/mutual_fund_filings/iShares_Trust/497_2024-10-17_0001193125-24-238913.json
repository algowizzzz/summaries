  "text": "iShares \u00ae\n\niShares Trust\n\nSupplement dated October 17, 2024\n\nto the currently effective Summary Prospectus,\nProspectus\n\nand Statement of Additional Information (the\n\u0093SAI\u0094) for the\n\niShares \u00aeiBonds \u00aeDec 2024 Term Treasury ETF*\n(IBTE) (the \u0093Fund\u0094)\n\n* The iShares iBonds Dec 2024 Term Treasury\nETF may also conduct business as the iBonds\nDec 2024 Term Treasury ETF.\n\nOn December 3, 2019 in connection with the\nestablishment of the Fund, the Board of\nTrustees of the Trust approved the planned\nliquidation, dissolution and termination of\nthe Fund. As a result, the last day of trading\nin the Fund on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\n(\u0093Nasdaq\u0094) will be December 16, 2024. Nasdaq\nwill suspend trading in the Fund before the\nopen of\ntrading on December 17, 2024, and shares of\nthe Fund will no longer be available for new\ninvestments as of this date. Proceeds of the\nliquidation are currently scheduled to be sent\nto shareholders on December 19, 2024. The\nFund\u0092s\nfinal net asset value, as calculated on\nDecember 16, 2024, will include any costs\nassociated with the liquidation expected to be\nborne by the Fund.\n\nBecause\nshares of the Fund will not be traded on\nNasdaq during the period between December 17,\n2024 and December 19, 2024, we cannot assure\nyou that there will be a trading market for\nyour shares. Further, during this period, the\nFund will be in\nthe process of closing down and liquidating\nits portfolio, which may result in the Fund\nnot being able to track its Underlying Index\n(by December 17, 2024, the Underlying Index\nvalue will be represented almost entirely by\ncash as no securities\nwill remain in the Underlying Index). After\nDecember 16, 2024, shareholders that remain\ninvested in the Fund will receive the entire\namount of their pro rata share of the\nliquidation proceeds on or about December 19,\n2024, subject to their\nbrokerage firm\u0092s processes.\n\nShareholders may sell their holdings of the\nFund prior to December 17, 2024 and may incur\nthe usual and customary brokerage\ncommissions associated with the sale of Fund\nshares. If you still hold shares of the Fund\non December 19, 2024, the Fund will\nautomatically redeem your shares for cash\nbased on the net asset value as of the close\nof business on\nDecember 16, 2024, which will include any\ndividends or distributions calculated as of\nthat date.\n\nIf you are subject to federal income tax, the\nliquidation of\nthe Fund will result in one or more taxable\nevents for you. A sale or exchange of Fund\nshares prior to the liquidation will generally\ngive rise to a capital gain or loss to you for\nfederal income tax purposes. In connection\nwith the liquidation, the\nFund may declare tax exempt or taxable\ndistributions of its investment income and/or\ntaxable distributions of its net capital gain.\nAny liquidation proceeds paid to you should\ngenerally be treated as received by you in\nexchange for your shares and\nwill therefore generally give rise to a\ncapital gain or loss depending on your tax\nbasis. Please refer to the \u0093Taxes\u0094 disclosure\nbeginning on page 123 of the SAI and consult\nyour own tax advisor\n\nabout the potential tax consequences of the\nFund\u0092s liquidation, including any state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax consequences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors or its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-IBTE-1024\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
