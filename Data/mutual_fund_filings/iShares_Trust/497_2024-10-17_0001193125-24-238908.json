  "text": "iShares \u00ae\n\niShares Trust\n\nSupplement dated October 17, 2024\n\nto the currently effective Summary Prospectus,\nProspectus\n\nand Statement of Additional Information (the\n\u0093SAI\u0094) for the\n\niShares \u00aeiBonds \u00aeDec 2024 Term Corporate ETF*\n(IBDP) (the \u0093Fund\u0094)\n\n*The iShares iBonds Dec 2024 Term Corporate\nETF may also conduct business as the iBonds\nDec 2024 Term Corporate ETF.\n\nOn December 4, 2014 in connection with the\nestablishment of the Fund, the Board of\nTrustees of the Trust approved the planned\nliquidation, dissolution and termination of\nthe Fund. As a result, the last day of trading\nin the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc. (\u0093NYSE Arca\u0094)\nwill be December 16, 2024. NYSE Arca will\nsuspend trading in the Fund before the open of\ntrading\non December 17, 2024, and shares of the Fund\nwill no longer be available for new\ninvestments as of this date. Proceeds of the\nliquidation are currently scheduled to be sent\nto shareholders on December 19, 2024. The\nFund\u0092s final net\nasset value, as calculated on December 16,\n2024, will include any costs associated with\nthe liquidation expected to be borne by the\nFund.\n\nBecause shares of the\nFund will not be traded on NYSE Arca during\nthe period between December 17, 2024 and\nDecember 19, 2024, we cannot assure you that\nthere will be a trading market for your\nshares. Further, during this period, the Fund\nwill be in the process\nof closing down and liquidating its portfolio,\nwhich may result in the Fund not being able to\ntrack its Underlying Index (by December 17,\n2024, the Underlying Index value will be\nrepresented almost entirely by cash as no\nsecurities will remain\nin the Underlying Index). After December 16,\n2024, shareholders that remain invested in the\nFund will receive the entire amount of their\npro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on\nor about December 19, 2024, subject to their\nbrokerage\nfirm\u0092s processes.\n\nShareholders may sell their holdings of the\nFund prior to December 17, 2024 and may incur\nthe usual and customary brokerage commissions\nassociated with the sale of Fund shares. If\nyou still hold shares of the Fund on December\n19, 2024, the Fund will automatically redeem\nyour shares for cash based on the net asset\nvalue as of the close of business on December\n16, 2024,\nwhich will include any dividends or\ndistributions calculated as of that date.\n\nIf you are subject to federal income tax, the\nliquidation of the Fund will result in\none or more taxable events for you. A sale or\nexchange of Fund shares prior to the\nliquidation will generally give rise to a\ncapital gain or loss to you for federal income\ntax purposes. In connection with the\nliquidation, the Fund may declare tax\nexempt or taxable distributions of its\ninvestment income and/or taxable distributions\nof its net capital gain. Any liquidation\nproceeds paid to you should generally be\ntreated as received by you in exchange for\nyour shares and will therefore\ngenerally give rise to a capital gain or loss\ndepending on your tax basis. Please refer to\nthe \u0093Taxes\u0094 disclosure beginning on page 123\nof the SAI and consult your own tax advisor\n\nabout the potential tax consequences of the\nFund\u0092s liquidation, including any state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax consequences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors or its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-IBDP-1024\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
