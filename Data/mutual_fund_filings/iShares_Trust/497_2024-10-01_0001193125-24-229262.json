Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\ntotal returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses are not included in the\ncalculation of the ratio of expenses to\naverage net assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund\u2019s prospectus\n(the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the investment\nadviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees in\nan amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2029only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n                    Acqu\u2026        Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  Dist\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Tot\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n       (12b\u2026        andE\u2026  Ann\u2026  Expe\u2026  Wai\u2026  \n                                        Exp\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.03%  0.5\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.5\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. 3 Based on estimated amounts\nfor the current fiscal year. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $51        $160  \n                   \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may pay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when they buy and sell securities\n(or \u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may indicate higher\ntransaction costs and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to incur increased\nexpenses. These costs, which are not reflected\nin the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in\nthe Example (except costs to the Underlying\nFund included as part of acquired fund fees\nand expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\nBecause the Fund is new, there is no\nreportable turnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to provide exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize\nthe downside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe large-capitalization sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities in\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are weighted based\non the float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The Underlying ETF\u2019s Index\nconsists of securities from a broad range of\nindustries. The components of the Underlying\nETF\u2019s Index are likely to change over time.\nBFA is the investment adviser to the\nUnderlying ETF and receives a management fee\nfrom the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is\nmanaged using a representative sampling\nindexing strategy. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying ETF may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nperformance of the Underlying ETF to diverge\nfrom that of the Underlying ETF's Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (April 1 through March 31),\nsubject to the annual S-2 rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund's market value\nand Net Asset Value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) may not\ncorrelate with the Underlying ETF and\nUnderlying ETF's Index, especially during each\nHedge Period. The strike prices for the capped\ncalls will change for each Hedge Period\ndepending on the prevailing market conditions\nand the cost of the put option for that Hedge\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Hedge Period. The Fund will\ntypically buy Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index and seek\nto enter into the combination of options\ntransactions described above if there are any\ninflows, or creation transactions, during a\nHedge Period. This will occur even in\ncircumstances where the Fund would receive a\nnegligible premium for writing an out-of-the-\nmoney call which may potentially give up more\nsizable returns to the extent that the option\nlater becomes in the money. Because the Fund\nwill effectively use distributions from the\nUnderlying ETF to purchase the downside\nprotection, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely\nto be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of April 1 through March\n31, the Approximate Cap is [__]% prior to\ntaking into account any fees or expenses\ncharged to or transaction costs incurred by\nthe Fund or Underlying ETF. When the Fund\u2019s\nannualized management fee of 0.50% of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets is taken into\naccount, the Approximate Cap for the current\nHedge Period is reduced to [__]%. The returns\nthat the Fund seeks to provide also do not\ninclude the costs associated with purchasing\nshares of the Fund. The Approximate Buffer\nthat the Fund typically seeks to provide is\nagainst approximately 100% of Underlying ETF\nlosses for the applicable Hedge Period;\nhowever, there is no guarantee that the\nApproximate Buffer will succeed in providing\nthe intended protection. The Approximate\nBuffer is provided prior to taking into\naccount any fees or expenses charged to the\nFund. These fees and any expenses will reduce\nthe Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund's NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund's\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap S-3 and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you could lose\nall or part of your investment in the Fund,\nand the Fund's performance could trail that of\nother investments.The Fund is subject to\ncertain risks (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Fund), including\nthe principal risks noted below, any of which\nmay adversely affect the Fund's NAV , trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Certain key risks\nare prioritized below (with others following\nin alphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Buffered\nLoss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the\nFund will be successful in its strategy to\nprovide downside protection against Underlying\nETF losses. The Fund does not provide\nprincipal protection or non-principal\nprotection, and, despite the Approximate\nBuffer, an investor may experience significant\nlosses on their investment, including the loss\nof their entire investment. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, the Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund seeks to provide may not\nbe available. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer. Capped Upside\nReturn Risk. The Fund\u2019s strategy seeks to\nprovide returns that are subject to an\nApproximate Cap. The Approximate Cap\nrepresents an approximate maximum percentage\nreturn that an investor can achieve from an\ninvestment in the Fund held over an entire\nHedge Period. In the event that the Underlying\nETF experiences gains in excess of the upside\nlimit to which the Fund is subject as a result\nof the capped call for a Hedge Period, the\nFund will not participate in those gains\nbeyond the upside limit. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, there may be\nlittle or no ability for that investor to\nexperience an investment gain on their Fund\nshares. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap. FLEX Options Risk. In\naddition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options\nare subject to the risk that they may be less\nliquid than certain other securities, such as\nstandardized options. In less liquid markets\nfor the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX\nOptions may require the payment of a premium\nor acceptance of a discounted price and may\ntake longer to complete. In a less liquid\nmarket for the FLEX Options, the liquidation\nof a large number of options may significantly\nimpact the price of the options and may\nadversely impact the value of your investment.\nAdditionally, to the extent market\nparticipants are not willing or able to enter\ninto FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at\nprices that reflect the market price of the\nFund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and, in turn the\nshare price of the Fund, could be negatively\nimpacted. The FLEX Options held by the Fund\nwill be exercisable at the strike price only\non their expiration date. As an in-the-money\nFLEX Option approaches its expiration date,\nits value typically will increasingly move\nwith the value of the Underlying ETF. However,\nthe value of the FLEX Options prior to the\nexpiration date may vary because of related\nfactors other than the value of the Underlying\nETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nusing other recognized pricing methods.\nFactors that may influence the value of the\nFLEX Options generally include interest rate\nchanges, dividends, the actual and implied\nvolatility levels of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price, and the remaining time until the\nFLEX Options expire, among others. The value\nof the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically\ndo not increase or decrease at the same rate\nas the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price on a day-\nto-day basis due to these factors (although\nthey generally move in the same direction),\nand, as a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not\nincrease or decrease at the same rate as the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Affiliated Fund Risk. In managing the\nFund, BFA has the ability to select Underlying\nFunds and substitute Underlying Funds with\nother ETFs that it believes will achieve the\nFund\u2019s objective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest in selecting\nUnderlying Funds and substituting Underlying\nFunds with other ETFs because the fees paid to\nBFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than the fees\npaid by other Underlying Funds. This risk may\nbe reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with\nrespect to the Underlying Fund. If an\nUnderlying Fund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess of a certain\namount, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap Change Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap are dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions ( e.g. volatility, interest\nrates, dividends, and other factors). As such,\nthe Approximate Buffer S-4 and Approximate Cap\nmay rise or fall from one Hedge Period to the\nnext, sometimes to a significant extent, and\nare unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Hedge Periods. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, an index, or other asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized Participant\n(as defined below in Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-party investor,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, or another fund may invest in the\nFund and hold its investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund to achieve\nsize or scale. There can be no assurance that\nany such entity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of the Fund would\nbe maintained at such levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Clearing Member\nDefault Risk. Transactions in some types of\nderivatives, including FLEX Options and\nfutures, are required to be centrally cleared\n( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ). In a transaction\ninvolving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house, such as the\nOCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the\nFund is not a member of clearing houses and\nonly members of a clearing house ( \u201c clearing\nmembers \u201d ) can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund will hold cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives positions, the\nFund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through their accounts at\nclearing members. Customer funds held at a\nclearing organization in connection with any\noptions contracts are held in a commingled\nomnibus account and are not identified to the\nname of the clearing member\u2019s individual\ncustomers. As a result, assets deposited by\nthe Fund with any clearing member as margin\nfor FLEX Options or futures may, in certain\ncircumstances, be used to satisfy losses of\nother clients of the Fund\u2019s clearing member.\nIn addition, although clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u2019\nobligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's\nor the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there\nis a risk that the assets of the Fund might\nnot be fully protected in the event of the\nclearing member\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund\nwould be limited to recovering only a pro rata\nshare of all available funds segregated on\nbehalf of the clearing member\u2019s customers for\nthe relevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives are\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the FLEX\nOptions. As a result, the ability of the Fund\nto meet its objective depends on the OCC being\nable to meet its obligations. In the unlikely\nevent that the OCC becomes insolvent or is\notherwise unable to meet its settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. Derivatives Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns or increase volatility.\nVolatility is defined as the characteristic of\na security, an index or a market to fluctuate\nsignificantly in price within a short time\nperiod. Derivatives may also be subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of\nthe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives is that the\nfluctuations in their values may not correlate\nperfectly with the value of the underlying\nasset, the performance of the asset class to\nwhich the Fund seeks exposure or to the\nperformance of the overall securities markets.\nThe possible lack of a liquid secondary market\nfor derivatives and the resulting inability of\nthe Fund to sell or otherwise close a\nderivatives position could expose the Fund to\nlosses and could make derivatives more\ndifficult for the Fund to value accurately.\nThe Fund could also suffer losses related to\nits derivatives positions as a result of\nunanticipated market movements, which losses\nare potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives\nmay give rise to a form of leverage and may\nexpose the Fund to greater risk and increase\nits costs. To the extent that the Fund invests\nin rolling futures contracts, it may be\nsubject to additional risk. The impact of U.S.\nand global regulation of derivatives may make\nderivatives more costly, may limit the\navailability of derivatives, may delay or\nrestrict the exercise by the S-5 Fund of\ntermination rights or remedies upon a\ncounterparty default under derivatives held by\nthe Fund (which could result in losses), or\nmay otherwise adversely affect the value or\nperformance of derivatives. In addition, the\nFund's use of derivatives may expose the Fund\nto risks related to potential operational\nissues, such as documentation and settlement\nissues, systems failures, inadequate controls\nand human error. Derivatives may also involve\nlegal risks, including insufficient\ndocumentation, insufficient capacity or\nauthority of a counterparty, and legality and\nenforceability of a contract. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Futures Contract Risk.\nFutures are standardized, exchange-traded\ncontracts that obligate a purchaser to take\ndelivery, and a seller to make delivery, of a\nspecific amount of an asset at a specified\nfuture date at a specified price. Unlike\nequities, which typically entitle the holder\nto a continuing ownership stake in an issuer,\nfutures contracts normally specify a certain\ndate for settlement in cash based on the level\nof the reference rate. The primary risks\nassociated with the use of futures contracts\nare: (i) the imperfect correlation between the\nchange in market value of the instruments held\nby the Fund and the price of the futures\ncontract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid\nsecondary market for a futures contract and\nthe resulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA\u2019s inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations. Hedge\nPeriod Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to\nFund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of the Hedge Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nInvestment in the Underlying Fund Risk. The\nFund invests substantially all of its assets\nin the Underlying Fund, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance is related to the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund\u2019s\nNAV will change with changes in the value of\nthe Underlying Fund and other instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the Fund will\nentail more costs and expenses than a direct\ninvestment in the Underlying Fund. Investment\nObjective Risk. Certain circumstances under\nwhich the Fund might not achieve its objective\ninclude, but are not limited, to (i) if the\nFund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii)\nif the Fund is unable to maintain the\nproportional relationship based on the number\nof exchange-traded options in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, (iii) significant accrual of Fund\nexpenses in connection with effecting the\nFund\u2019s principal investment strategy or (iv)\nadverse tax law changes affecting the\ntreatment of FLEX Options. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses applied by BFA will not produce the\ndesired results, and that securities selected\nby BFA may underperform the market or any\nrelevant benchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing the Fund and may also\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\nachieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-6 Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Options Risk.\nInvestments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother assets decreased, remained the same or\nfailed to increase to a level at or beyond the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor increased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). If a put\nor call option purchased by the Fund were\npermitted to expire without being sold or\nexercised, its premium would represent a loss\nto the Fund. To the extent that the Fund\nwrites or sells an option, if the decline or\nincrease in the underlying asset is\nsignificantly below or above the exercise\nprice of the written option, the Fund could\nexperience a substantial loss. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s\nand the Underlying Fund's investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s or the\nUnderlying Fund's investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Tax\nRisk. The Fund intends to elect and to qualify\neach year to be treated as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) under\nSubchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue\nCode \u201d ). As a RIC, the Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its net investment income and net\ncapital gain that it distributes to\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies\ncertain requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode. However, the federal income tax\ntreatment of certain aspects of the proposed\noperations of the Fund are not entirely clear.\nThis includes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s\noptions strategy, its hedging strategy, the\npossible application of the \u201c straddle \u201d\nrules, and various loss limitation provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and\nmaintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must\nmeet certain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. In\nparticular, there is no published Internal\nRevenue Service guidance or case law on how to\ndetermine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nBased upon the language in the legislative\nhistory, the Fund intends to treat the issuer\nof the FLEX Options as the referenced asset,\nwhich, assuming the referenced asset qualifies\nas a RIC, would allow the Fund to count the\nFLEX Options as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the RIC diversification\nrequirements. The Fund intends to treat any\nincome it may derive from the FLEX Options as\n\u201c qualifying income \u201d under the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs.\nIf the income is not qualifying income or the\nissuer of the FLEX Options is not\nappropriately the referenced asset, the Fund\nmay not qualify, or may be disqualified, as a\nRIC. If the Fund does not qualify as a RIC for\nany taxable year and certain relief provisions\nare not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwill be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Upside\nParticipation Risk . There can be no guarantee\nthat the Fund will be successful in its\nstrategy to match the increase, if any, of the\nshare price return of the Underlying ETF over\na Hedge Period, subject to an Approximate Cap.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of a Hedge Period or does\nnot stay invested in the Fund for the entirety\nof the Hedge S-7 Period, the returns realized\nby the investor may not match those that the\nFund seeks to achieve. Valuation Risk . The\nprice that the Fund could receive upon the\nsale (or other disposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. In addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the Prospectus,\nthe Fund has not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance information to\nreport. S-8 Management Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors. Portfolio Managers.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead\n(the \u201c Portfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since inception (2024).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\ntotal returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses are not included in the\ncalculation of the ratio of expenses to\naverage net assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund\u2019s prospectus\n(the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the investment\nadviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees in\nan amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2029only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n                    Acqu\u2026        Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  Dist\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Tot\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n       (12b\u2026        andE\u2026  Ann\u2026  Expe\u2026  Wai\u2026  \n                                        Exp\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.03%  0.5\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.5\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. 3 Based on estimated amounts\nfor the current fiscal year. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $51        $160  \n                   \nS-10\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may pay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when they buy and sell securities\n(or \u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may indicate higher\ntransaction costs and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to incur increased\nexpenses. These costs, which are not reflected\nin the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in\nthe Example (except costs to the Underlying\nFund included as part of acquired fund fees\nand expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\nBecause the Fund is new, there is no\nreportable turnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to provide exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize\nthe downside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe large-capitalization sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities in\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are weighted based\non the float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The Underlying ETF\u2019s Index\nconsists of securities from a broad range of\nindustries. The components of the Underlying\nETF\u2019s Index are likely to change over time.\nBFA is the investment adviser to the\nUnderlying ETF and receives a management fee\nfrom the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is\nmanaged using a representative sampling\nindexing strategy. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying ETF may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nperformance of the Underlying ETF to diverge\nfrom that of the Underlying ETF's Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (July 1 through June 30),\nsubject to the annual S-11 rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund's market value\nand Net Asset Value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) may not\ncorrelate with the Underlying ETF and\nUnderlying ETF's Index, especially during each\nHedge Period. The strike prices for the capped\ncalls will change for each Hedge Period\ndepending on the prevailing market conditions\nand the cost of the put option for that Hedge\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Hedge Period. The Fund will\ntypically buy Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index and seek\nto enter into the combination of options\ntransactions described above if there are any\ninflows, or creation transactions, during a\nHedge Period. This will occur even in\ncircumstances where the Fund would receive a\nnegligible premium for writing an out-of-the-\nmoney call which may potentially give up more\nsizable returns to the extent that the option\nlater becomes in the money. Because the Fund\nwill effectively use distributions from the\nUnderlying ETF to purchase the downside\nprotection, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely\nto be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of July 1 through June\n30, the Approximate Cap is 111.14% prior to\ntaking into account any fees or expenses\ncharged to or transaction costs incurred by\nthe Fund or Underlying ETF. When the Fund\u2019s\nannualized management fee of 0.50% of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets is taken into\naccount, the Approximate Cap for the current\nHedge Period is reduced to 110.64%. The\nreturns that the Fund seeks to provide also do\nnot include the costs associated with\npurchasing shares of the Fund. The Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide is against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod; however, there is no guarantee that\nthe Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund's NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund's\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap S-12 and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you could lose\nall or part of your investment in the Fund,\nand the Fund's performance could trail that of\nother investments.The Fund is subject to\ncertain risks (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Fund), including\nthe principal risks noted below, any of which\nmay adversely affect the Fund's NAV , trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Certain key risks\nare prioritized below (with others following\nin alphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Buffered\nLoss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the\nFund will be successful in its strategy to\nprovide downside protection against Underlying\nETF losses. The Fund does not provide\nprincipal protection or non-principal\nprotection, and, despite the Approximate\nBuffer, an investor may experience significant\nlosses on their investment, including the loss\nof their entire investment. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, the Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund seeks to provide may not\nbe available. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer. Capped Upside\nReturn Risk. The Fund\u2019s strategy seeks to\nprovide returns that are subject to an\nApproximate Cap. The Approximate Cap\nrepresents an approximate maximum percentage\nreturn that an investor can achieve from an\ninvestment in the Fund held over an entire\nHedge Period. In the event that the Underlying\nETF experiences gains in excess of the upside\nlimit to which the Fund is subject as a result\nof the capped call for a Hedge Period, the\nFund will not participate in those gains\nbeyond the upside limit. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, there may be\nlittle or no ability for that investor to\nexperience an investment gain on their Fund\nshares. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap. FLEX Options Risk. In\naddition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options\nare subject to the risk that they may be less\nliquid than certain other securities, such as\nstandardized options. In less liquid markets\nfor the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX\nOptions may require the payment of a premium\nor acceptance of a discounted price and may\ntake longer to complete. In a less liquid\nmarket for the FLEX Options, the liquidation\nof a large number of options may significantly\nimpact the price of the options and may\nadversely impact the value of your investment.\nAdditionally, to the extent market\nparticipants are not willing or able to enter\ninto FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at\nprices that reflect the market price of the\nFund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and, in turn the\nshare price of the Fund, could be negatively\nimpacted. The FLEX Options held by the Fund\nwill be exercisable at the strike price only\non their expiration date. As an in-the-money\nFLEX Option approaches its expiration date,\nits value typically will increasingly move\nwith the value of the Underlying ETF. However,\nthe value of the FLEX Options prior to the\nexpiration date may vary because of related\nfactors other than the value of the Underlying\nETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nusing other recognized pricing methods.\nFactors that may influence the value of the\nFLEX Options generally include interest rate\nchanges, dividends, the actual and implied\nvolatility levels of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price, and the remaining time until the\nFLEX Options expire, among others. The value\nof the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically\ndo not increase or decrease at the same rate\nas the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price on a day-\nto-day basis due to these factors (although\nthey generally move in the same direction),\nand, as a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not\nincrease or decrease at the same rate as the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Affiliated Fund Risk. In managing the\nFund, BFA has the ability to select Underlying\nFunds and substitute Underlying Funds with\nother ETFs that it believes will achieve the\nFund\u2019s objective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest in selecting\nUnderlying Funds and substituting Underlying\nFunds with other ETFs because the fees paid to\nBFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than the fees\npaid by other Underlying Funds. This risk may\nbe reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with\nrespect to the Underlying Fund. If an\nUnderlying Fund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess of a certain\namount, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap Change Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap are dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions ( e.g. volatility, interest\nrates, dividends, and other factors). As such,\nthe Approximate Buffer S-13 and Approximate\nCap may rise or fall from one Hedge Period to\nthe next, sometimes to a significant extent,\nand are unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Hedge Periods. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, an index, or other asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized Participant\n(as defined below in Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-party investor,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, or another fund may invest in the\nFund and hold its investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund to achieve\nsize or scale. There can be no assurance that\nany such entity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of the Fund would\nbe maintained at such levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Clearing Member\nDefault Risk. Transactions in some types of\nderivatives, including FLEX Options and\nfutures, are required to be centrally cleared\n( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ). In a transaction\ninvolving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house, such as the\nOCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the\nFund is not a member of clearing houses and\nonly members of a clearing house ( \u201c clearing\nmembers \u201d ) can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund will hold cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives positions, the\nFund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through their accounts at\nclearing members. Customer funds held at a\nclearing organization in connection with any\noptions contracts are held in a commingled\nomnibus account and are not identified to the\nname of the clearing member\u2019s individual\ncustomers. As a result, assets deposited by\nthe Fund with any clearing member as margin\nfor FLEX Options or futures may, in certain\ncircumstances, be used to satisfy losses of\nother clients of the Fund\u2019s clearing member.\nIn addition, although clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u2019\nobligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's\nor the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there\nis a risk that the assets of the Fund might\nnot be fully protected in the event of the\nclearing member\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund\nwould be limited to recovering only a pro rata\nshare of all available funds segregated on\nbehalf of the clearing member\u2019s customers for\nthe relevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives are\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the FLEX\nOptions. As a result, the ability of the Fund\nto meet its objective depends on the OCC being\nable to meet its obligations. In the unlikely\nevent that the OCC becomes insolvent or is\notherwise unable to meet its settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. Derivatives Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns or increase volatility.\nVolatility is defined as the characteristic of\na security, an index or a market to fluctuate\nsignificantly in price within a short time\nperiod. Derivatives may also be subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of\nthe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives is that the\nfluctuations in their values may not correlate\nperfectly with the value of the underlying\nasset, the performance of the asset class to\nwhich the Fund seeks exposure or to the\nperformance of the overall securities markets.\nThe possible lack of a liquid secondary market\nfor derivatives and the resulting inability of\nthe Fund to sell or otherwise close a\nderivatives position could expose the Fund to\nlosses and could make derivatives more\ndifficult for the Fund to value accurately.\nThe Fund could also suffer losses related to\nits derivatives positions as a result of\nunanticipated market movements, which losses\nare potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives\nmay give rise to a form of leverage and may\nexpose the Fund to greater risk and increase\nits costs. To the extent that the Fund invests\nin rolling futures contracts, it may be\nsubject to additional risk. The impact of U.S.\nand global regulation of derivatives may make\nderivatives more costly, may limit the\navailability of derivatives, may delay or\nrestrict the exercise by the S-14 Fund of\ntermination rights or remedies upon a\ncounterparty default under derivatives held by\nthe Fund (which could result in losses), or\nmay otherwise adversely affect the value or\nperformance of derivatives. In addition, the\nFund's use of derivatives may expose the Fund\nto risks related to potential operational\nissues, such as documentation and settlement\nissues, systems failures, inadequate controls\nand human error. Derivatives may also involve\nlegal risks, including insufficient\ndocumentation, insufficient capacity or\nauthority of a counterparty, and legality and\nenforceability of a contract. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Futures Contract Risk.\nFutures are standardized, exchange-traded\ncontracts that obligate a purchaser to take\ndelivery, and a seller to make delivery, of a\nspecific amount of an asset at a specified\nfuture date at a specified price. Unlike\nequities, which typically entitle the holder\nto a continuing ownership stake in an issuer,\nfutures contracts normally specify a certain\ndate for settlement in cash based on the level\nof the reference rate. The primary risks\nassociated with the use of futures contracts\nare: (i) the imperfect correlation between the\nchange in market value of the instruments held\nby the Fund and the price of the futures\ncontract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid\nsecondary market for a futures contract and\nthe resulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA\u2019s inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations. Hedge\nPeriod Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to\nFund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of the Hedge Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nInvestment in the Underlying Fund Risk. The\nFund invests substantially all of its assets\nin the Underlying Fund, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance is related to the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund\u2019s\nNAV will change with changes in the value of\nthe Underlying Fund and other instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the Fund will\nentail more costs and expenses than a direct\ninvestment in the Underlying Fund. Investment\nObjective Risk. Certain circumstances under\nwhich the Fund might not achieve its objective\ninclude, but are not limited, to (i) if the\nFund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii)\nif the Fund is unable to maintain the\nproportional relationship based on the number\nof exchange-traded options in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, (iii) significant accrual of Fund\nexpenses in connection with effecting the\nFund\u2019s principal investment strategy or (iv)\nadverse tax law changes affecting the\ntreatment of FLEX Options. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses applied by BFA will not produce the\ndesired results, and that securities selected\nby BFA may underperform the market or any\nrelevant benchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing the Fund and may also\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\nachieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-15 Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Options Risk.\nInvestments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother assets decreased, remained the same or\nfailed to increase to a level at or beyond the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor increased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). If a put\nor call option purchased by the Fund were\npermitted to expire without being sold or\nexercised, its premium would represent a loss\nto the Fund. To the extent that the Fund\nwrites or sells an option, if the decline or\nincrease in the underlying asset is\nsignificantly below or above the exercise\nprice of the written option, the Fund could\nexperience a substantial loss. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s\nand the Underlying Fund's investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s or the\nUnderlying Fund's investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Tax\nRisk. The Fund intends to elect and to qualify\neach year to be treated as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) under\nSubchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue\nCode \u201d ). As a RIC, the Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its net investment income and net\ncapital gain that it distributes to\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies\ncertain requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode. However, the federal income tax\ntreatment of certain aspects of the proposed\noperations of the Fund are not entirely clear.\nThis includes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s\noptions strategy, its hedging strategy, the\npossible application of the \u201c straddle \u201d\nrules, and various loss limitation provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and\nmaintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must\nmeet certain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. In\nparticular, there is no published Internal\nRevenue Service guidance or case law on how to\ndetermine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nBased upon the language in the legislative\nhistory, the Fund intends to treat the issuer\nof the FLEX Options as the referenced asset,\nwhich, assuming the referenced asset qualifies\nas a RIC, would allow the Fund to count the\nFLEX Options as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the RIC diversification\nrequirements. The Fund intends to treat any\nincome it may derive from the FLEX Options as\n\u201c qualifying income \u201d under the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs.\nIf the income is not qualifying income or the\nissuer of the FLEX Options is not\nappropriately the referenced asset, the Fund\nmay not qualify, or may be disqualified, as a\nRIC. If the Fund does not qualify as a RIC for\nany taxable year and certain relief provisions\nare not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwill be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Upside\nParticipation Risk . There can be no guarantee\nthat the Fund will be successful in its\nstrategy to match the increase, if any, of the\nshare price return of the Underlying ETF over\na Hedge Period, subject to an Approximate Cap.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of a Hedge Period or does\nnot stay invested in the Fund for the entirety\nof the Hedge S-16 Period, the returns realized\nby the investor may not match those that the\nFund seeks to achieve. Valuation Risk . The\nprice that the Fund could receive upon the\nsale (or other disposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. In addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the Prospectus,\nthe Fund has not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance information to\nreport. S-17 Management Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors. Portfolio Managers.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead\n(the \u201c Portfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since inception (2024).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-18\n\niSHARES \u00ae LARGE CAP MAX BUFFER SEP ETF Ticker:\nSMAX Stock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment\nObjective The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Sep\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the share\nprice return of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n(the \u201c Underlying ETF \u201d or \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d\n) up to an approximate upside limit, while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst price declines of the Underlying ETF\nover an approximate 12-month period beginning\nat the end of each September. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur\n\u201c Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund\u2019s pro\nrata share of the fees and expenses incurred\nindirectly by the Fund as a result of\ninvesting in other investment companies. The\nimpact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is\nincluded in the total returns of the Fund.\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not\nincluded in the calculation of the ratio of\nexpenses to average net assets shown in the\nFinancial Highlights section of the Fund\u2019s\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any,\nattributable to investments by the Fund in\nother series of the Trust and iShares, Inc.\nthrough November 30, 2029. The contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to November 30,\n2029only upon written agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n                    Acqu\u2026        Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  Dist\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Tot\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n       (12b\u2026        andE\u2026  Ann\u2026  Expe\u2026  Wai\u2026  \n                                        Exp\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.03%  0.5\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.5\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. 3 Based on estimated amounts\nfor the current fiscal year.

The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $51        $160  \n                   \nS-19\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may pay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when they buy and sell securities\n(or \u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may indicate higher\ntransaction costs and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to incur increased\nexpenses. These costs, which are not reflected\nin the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in\nthe Example (except costs to the Underlying\nFund included as part of acquired fund fees\nand expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\nBecause the Fund is new, there is no\nreportable turnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to provide exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize\nthe downside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe large-capitalization sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities in\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are weighted based\non the float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The Underlying ETF\u2019s Index\nconsists of securities from a broad range of\nindustries. The components of the Underlying\nETF\u2019s Index are likely to change over time.\nBFA is the investment adviser to the\nUnderlying ETF and receives a management fee\nfrom the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is\nmanaged using a representative sampling\nindexing strategy. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying ETF may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nperformance of the Underlying ETF to diverge\nfrom that of the Underlying ETF's Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (October 1 through September\n30), subject to the S-20 annual rebalancing\nprocess described below. The Fund will be\nindefinitely offered and is not intended to\nterminate after one or more Hedge Periods. For\neach Hedge Period, the Fund obtains exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF by purchasing shares of the Underlying ETF\nand futures that reference the price\nperformance of the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and\ncreates the Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap by trading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund's market value\nand Net Asset Value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) may not\ncorrelate with the Underlying ETF and\nUnderlying ETF's Index, especially during each\nHedge Period. The strike prices for the capped\ncalls will change for each Hedge Period\ndepending on the prevailing market conditions\nand the cost of the put option for that Hedge\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Hedge Period. The Fund will\ntypically buy Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index and seek\nto enter into the combination of options\ntransactions described above if there are any\ninflows, or creation transactions, during a\nHedge Period. This will occur even in\ncircumstances where the Fund would receive a\nnegligible premium for writing an out-of-the-\nmoney call which may potentially give up more\nsizable returns to the extent that the option\nlater becomes in the money. Because the Fund\nwill effectively use distributions from the\nUnderlying ETF to purchase the downside\nprotection, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely\nto be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of October 1 through\nSeptember 30, the Approximate Cap is 107.91%\nprior to taking into account any fees or\nexpenses charged to or transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF. When\nthe Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of 0.50%\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets is\ntaken into account, the Approximate Cap for\nthe current Hedge Period is reduced to\n107.41%. The returns that the Fund seeks to\nprovide also do not include the costs\nassociated with purchasing shares of the Fund.\nThe Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically\nseeks to provide is against approximately 100%\nof Underlying ETF losses for the applicable\nHedge Period; however, there is no guarantee\nthat the Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund's NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund's\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap S-21 and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you could lose\nall or part of your investment in the Fund,\nand the Fund's performance could trail that of\nother investments.The Fund is subject to\ncertain risks (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Fund), including\nthe principal risks noted below, any of which\nmay adversely affect the Fund's NAV , trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Certain key risks\nare prioritized below (with others following\nin alphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Buffered\nLoss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the\nFund will be successful in its strategy to\nprovide downside protection against Underlying\nETF losses. The Fund does not provide\nprincipal protection or non-principal\nprotection, and, despite the Approximate\nBuffer, an investor may experience significant\nlosses on their investment, including the loss\nof their entire investment. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, the Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund seeks to provide may not\nbe available. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer. Capped Upside\nReturn Risk. The Fund\u2019s strategy seeks to\nprovide returns that are subject to an\nApproximate Cap. The Approximate Cap\nrepresents an approximate maximum percentage\nreturn that an investor can achieve from an\ninvestment in the Fund held over an entire\nHedge Period. In the event that the Underlying\nETF experiences gains in excess of the upside\nlimit to which the Fund is subject as a result\nof the capped call for a Hedge Period, the\nFund will not participate in those gains\nbeyond the upside limit. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, there may be\nlittle or no ability for that investor to\nexperience an investment gain on their Fund\nshares. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap. FLEX Options Risk. In\naddition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options\nare subject to the risk that they may be less\nliquid than certain other securities, such as\nstandardized options. In less liquid markets\nfor the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX\nOptions may require the payment of a premium\nor acceptance of a discounted price and may\ntake longer to complete. In a less liquid\nmarket for the FLEX Options, the liquidation\nof a large number of options may significantly\nimpact the price of the options and may\nadversely impact the value of your investment.\nAdditionally, to the extent market\nparticipants are not willing or able to enter\ninto FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at\nprices that reflect the market price of the\nFund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and, in turn the\nshare price of the Fund, could be negatively\nimpacted. The FLEX Options held by the Fund\nwill be exercisable at the strike price only\non their expiration date. As an in-the-money\nFLEX Option approaches its expiration date,\nits value typically will increasingly move\nwith the value of the Underlying ETF. However,\nthe value of the FLEX Options prior to the\nexpiration date may vary because of related\nfactors other than the value of the Underlying\nETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nusing other recognized pricing methods.\nFactors that may influence the value of the\nFLEX Options generally include interest rate\nchanges, dividends, the actual and implied\nvolatility levels of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price, and the remaining time until the\nFLEX Options expire, among others. The value\nof the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically\ndo not increase or decrease at the same rate\nas the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price on a day-\nto-day basis due to these factors (although\nthey generally move in the same direction),\nand, as a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not\nincrease or decrease at the same rate as the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Affiliated Fund Risk. In managing the\nFund, BFA has the ability to select Underlying\nFunds and substitute Underlying Funds with\nother ETFs that it believes will achieve the\nFund\u2019s objective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest in selecting\nUnderlying Funds and substituting Underlying\nFunds with other ETFs because the fees paid to\nBFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than the fees\npaid by other Underlying Funds. This risk may\nbe reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with\nrespect to the Underlying Fund. If an\nUnderlying Fund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess of a certain\namount, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap Change Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap are dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions ( e.g. volatility, interest\nrates, dividends, and other factors). As such,\nthe Approximate Buffer S-22 and Approximate\nCap may rise or fall from one Hedge Period to\nthe next, sometimes to a significant extent,\nand are unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Hedge Periods. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, an index, or other asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized Participant\n(as defined below in Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-party investor,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, or another fund may invest in the\nFund and hold its investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund to achieve\nsize or scale. There can be no assurance that\nany such entity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of the Fund would\nbe maintained at such levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Clearing Member\nDefault Risk. Transactions in some types of\nderivatives, including FLEX Options and\nfutures, are required to be centrally cleared\n( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ). In a transaction\ninvolving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house, such as the\nOCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the\nFund is not a member of clearing houses and\nonly members of a clearing house ( \u201c clearing\nmembers \u201d ) can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund will hold cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives positions, the\nFund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through their accounts at\nclearing members. Customer funds held at a\nclearing organization in connection with any\noptions contracts are held in a commingled\nomnibus account and are not identified to the\nname of the clearing member\u2019s individual\ncustomers. As a result, assets deposited by\nthe Fund with any clearing member as margin\nfor FLEX Options or futures may, in certain\ncircumstances, be used to satisfy losses of\nother clients of the Fund\u2019s clearing member.\nIn addition, although clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u2019\nobligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's\nor the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there\nis a risk that the assets of the Fund might\nnot be fully protected in the event of the\nclearing member\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund\nwould be limited to recovering only a pro rata\nshare of all available funds segregated on\nbehalf of the clearing member\u2019s customers for\nthe relevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives are\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the FLEX\nOptions. As a result, the ability of the Fund\nto meet its objective depends on the OCC being\nable to meet its obligations. In the unlikely\nevent that the OCC becomes insolvent or is\notherwise unable to meet its settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. Derivatives Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns or increase volatility.\nVolatility is defined as the characteristic of\na security, an index or a market to fluctuate\nsignificantly in price within a short time\nperiod. Derivatives may also be subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of\nthe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives is that the\nfluctuations in their values may not correlate\nperfectly with the value of the underlying\nasset, the performance of the asset class to\nwhich the Fund seeks exposure or to the\nperformance of the overall securities markets.\nThe possible lack of a liquid secondary market\nfor derivatives and the resulting inability of\nthe Fund to sell or otherwise close a\nderivatives position could expose the Fund to\nlosses and could make derivatives more\ndifficult for the Fund to value accurately.\nThe Fund could also suffer losses related to\nits derivatives positions as a result of\nunanticipated market movements, which losses\nare potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives\nmay give rise to a form of leverage and may\nexpose the Fund to greater risk and increase\nits costs. To the extent that the Fund invests\nin rolling futures contracts, it may be\nsubject to additional risk. The impact of U.S.\nand global regulation of derivatives may make\nderivatives more costly, may limit the\navailability of derivatives, may delay or\nrestrict the exercise by the S-23 Fund of\ntermination rights or remedies upon a\ncounterparty default under derivatives held by\nthe Fund (which could result in losses), or\nmay otherwise adversely affect the value or\nperformance of derivatives. In addition, the\nFund's use of derivatives may expose the Fund\nto risks related to potential operational\nissues, such as documentation and settlement\nissues, systems failures, inadequate controls\nand human error. Derivatives may also involve\nlegal risks, including insufficient\ndocumentation, insufficient capacity or\nauthority of a counterparty, and legality and\nenforceability of a contract. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Futures Contract Risk.\nFutures are standardized, exchange-traded\ncontracts that obligate a purchaser to take\ndelivery, and a seller to make delivery, of a\nspecific amount of an asset at a specified\nfuture date at a specified price. Unlike\nequities, which typically entitle the holder\nto a continuing ownership stake in an issuer,\nfutures contracts normally specify a certain\ndate for settlement in cash based on the level\nof the reference rate. The primary risks\nassociated with the use of futures contracts\nare: (i) the imperfect correlation between the\nchange in market value of the instruments held\nby the Fund and the price of the futures\ncontract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid\nsecondary market for a futures contract and\nthe resulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA\u2019s inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations. Hedge\nPeriod Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to\nFund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of the Hedge Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nInvestment in the Underlying Fund Risk. The\nFund invests substantially all of its assets\nin the Underlying Fund, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance is related to the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund\u2019s\nNAV will change with changes in the value of\nthe Underlying Fund and other instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the Fund will\nentail more costs and expenses than a direct\ninvestment in the Underlying Fund. Investment\nObjective Risk. Certain circumstances under\nwhich the Fund might not achieve its objective\ninclude, but are not limited, to (i) if the\nFund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii)\nif the Fund is unable to maintain the\nproportional relationship based on the number\nof exchange-traded options in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, (iii) significant accrual of Fund\nexpenses in connection with effecting the\nFund\u2019s principal investment strategy or (iv)\nadverse tax law changes affecting the\ntreatment of FLEX Options. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses applied by BFA will not produce the\ndesired results, and that securities selected\nby BFA may underperform the market or any\nrelevant benchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing the Fund and may also\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\nachieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-24 Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Options Risk.\nInvestments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother assets decreased, remained the same or\nfailed to increase to a level at or beyond the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor increased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). If a put\nor call option purchased by the Fund were\npermitted to expire without being sold or\nexercised, its premium would represent a loss\nto the Fund. To the extent that the Fund\nwrites or sells an option, if the decline or\nincrease in the underlying asset is\nsignificantly below or above the exercise\nprice of the written option, the Fund could\nexperience a substantial loss. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s\nand the Underlying Fund's investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s or the\nUnderlying Fund's investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Tax\nRisk. The Fund intends to elect and to qualify\neach year to be treated as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) under\nSubchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue\nCode \u201d ). As a RIC, the Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its net investment income and net\ncapital gain that it distributes to\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies\ncertain requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode. However, the federal income tax\ntreatment of certain aspects of the proposed\noperations of the Fund are not entirely clear.\nThis includes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s\noptions strategy, its hedging strategy, the\npossible application of the \u201c straddle \u201d\nrules, and various loss limitation provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and\nmaintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must\nmeet certain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. In\nparticular, there is no published Internal\nRevenue Service guidance or case law on how to\ndetermine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nBased upon the language in the legislative\nhistory, the Fund intends to treat the issuer\nof the FLEX Options as the referenced asset,\nwhich, assuming the referenced asset qualifies\nas a RIC, would allow the Fund to count the\nFLEX Options as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the RIC diversification\nrequirements. The Fund intends to treat any\nincome it may derive from the FLEX Options as\n\u201c qualifying income \u201d under the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs.\nIf the income is not qualifying income or the\nissuer of the FLEX Options is not\nappropriately the referenced asset, the Fund\nmay not qualify, or may be disqualified, as a\nRIC. If the Fund does not qualify as a RIC for\nany taxable year and certain relief provisions\nare not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwill be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Upside\nParticipation Risk . There can be no guarantee\nthat the Fund will be successful in its\nstrategy to match the increase, if any, of the\nshare price return of the Underlying ETF over\na Hedge Period, subject to an Approximate Cap.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of a Hedge Period or does\nnot stay invested in the Fund for the entirety\nof the Hedge S-25 Period, the returns realized\nby the investor may not match those that the\nFund seeks to achieve. Valuation Risk . The\nprice that the Fund could receive upon the\nsale (or other disposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. In addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the Prospectus,\nthe Fund has not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance information to\nreport. S-26 Management Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors. Portfolio Managers.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead\n(the \u201c Portfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since inception (2024).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-27\n\niSHARES \u00ae LARGE CAP MAX BUFFER DEC ETF Ticker:\nDMAX Stock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment\nObjective The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Dec\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the share\nprice return of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n(the \u201c Underlying ETF \u201d or \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d\n) up to an approximate upside limit, while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst price declines of the Underlying ETF\nover an approximate 12-month period beginning\nat the end of each December. Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\ntotal returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses are not included in the\ncalculation of the ratio of expenses to\naverage net assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund\u2019s prospectus\n(the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the investment\nadviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees in\nan amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2029only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n                    Acqu\u2026        Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  Dist\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Tot\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n       (12b\u2026        andE\u2026  Ann\u2026  Expe\u2026  Wai\u2026  \n                                        Exp\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.03%  0.5\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.5\u2026  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. 3 Based on estimated amounts\nfor the current fiscal year. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $51        $160  \n                   \nS-28\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may pay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when they buy and sell securities\n(or \u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may indicate higher\ntransaction costs and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to incur increased\nexpenses. These costs, which are not reflected\nin the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in\nthe Example (except costs to the Underlying\nFund included as part of acquired fund fees\nand expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\nBecause the Fund is new, there is no\nreportable turnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to provide exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF up to an approximate upside limit (the \u201c\nApproximate Cap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize\nthe downside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe large-capitalization sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities in\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are weighted based\non the float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The Underlying ETF\u2019s Index\nconsists of securities from a broad range of\nindustries. The components of the Underlying\nETF\u2019s Index are likely to change over time.\nBFA is the investment adviser to the\nUnderlying ETF and receives a management fee\nfrom the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is\nmanaged using a representative sampling\nindexing strategy. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying ETF may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index, which may cause the\nperformance of the Underlying ETF to diverge\nfrom that of the Underlying ETF's Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (January 1 through December\n31), subject to the S-29 annual rebalancing\nprocess described below. The Fund will be\nindefinitely offered and is not intended to\nterminate after one or more Hedge Periods. For\neach Hedge Period, the Fund obtains exposure\nto the share price return of the Underlying\nETF by purchasing shares of the Underlying ETF\nand futures that reference the price\nperformance of the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and\ncreates the Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap by trading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund's market value\nand Net Asset Value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) may not\ncorrelate with the Underlying ETF and\nUnderlying ETF's Index, especially during each\nHedge Period. The strike prices for the capped\ncalls will change for each Hedge Period\ndepending on the prevailing market conditions\nand the cost of the put option for that Hedge\nPeriod, resulting in a different Approximate\nCap for each Hedge Period. The Fund will\ntypically buy Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index and seek\nto enter into the combination of options\ntransactions described above if there are any\ninflows, or creation transactions, during a\nHedge Period. This will occur even in\ncircumstances where the Fund would receive a\nnegligible premium for writing an out-of-the-\nmoney call which may potentially give up more\nsizable returns to the extent that the option\nlater becomes in the money. Because the Fund\nwill effectively use distributions from the\nUnderlying ETF to purchase the downside\nprotection, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely\nto be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of January 1 through\nDecember 31, the Approximate Cap is [__]%\nprior to taking into account any fees or\nexpenses charged to or transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF. When\nthe Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of 0.50%\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets is\ntaken into account, the Approximate Cap for\nthe current Hedge Period is reduced to [__]%.\nThe returns that the Fund seeks to provide\nalso do not include the costs associated with\npurchasing shares of the Fund. The Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide is against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod; however, there is no guarantee that\nthe Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund's NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund's\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap S-30 and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Summary of Principal\nRisks As with any investment, you could lose\nall or part of your investment in the Fund,\nand the Fund's performance could trail that of\nother investments.The Fund is subject to\ncertain risks (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Fund), including\nthe principal risks noted below, any of which\nmay adversely affect the Fund's NAV , trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Certain key risks\nare prioritized below (with others following\nin alphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Buffered\nLoss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the\nFund will be successful in its strategy to\nprovide downside protection against Underlying\nETF losses. The Fund does not provide\nprincipal protection or non-principal\nprotection, and, despite the Approximate\nBuffer, an investor may experience significant\nlosses on their investment, including the loss\nof their entire investment. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, the Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund seeks to provide may not\nbe available. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer. Capped Upside\nReturn Risk. The Fund\u2019s strategy seeks to\nprovide returns that are subject to an\nApproximate Cap. The Approximate Cap\nrepresents an approximate maximum percentage\nreturn that an investor can achieve from an\ninvestment in the Fund held over an entire\nHedge Period. In the event that the Underlying\nETF experiences gains in excess of the upside\nlimit to which the Fund is subject as a result\nof the capped call for a Hedge Period, the\nFund will not participate in those gains\nbeyond the upside limit. In the event an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge\nPeriod begins or sells Fund shares prior to\nthe end of the Hedge Period, there may be\nlittle or no ability for that investor to\nexperience an investment gain on their Fund\nshares. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap. FLEX Options Risk. In\naddition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options\nare subject to the risk that they may be less\nliquid than certain other securities, such as\nstandardized options. In less liquid markets\nfor the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX\nOptions may require the payment of a premium\nor acceptance of a discounted price and may\ntake longer to complete. In a less liquid\nmarket for the FLEX Options, the liquidation\nof a large number of options may significantly\nimpact the price of the options and may\nadversely impact the value of your investment.\nAdditionally, to the extent market\nparticipants are not willing or able to enter\ninto FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at\nprices that reflect the market price of the\nFund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and, in turn the\nshare price of the Fund, could be negatively\nimpacted. The FLEX Options held by the Fund\nwill be exercisable at the strike price only\non their expiration date. As an in-the-money\nFLEX Option approaches its expiration date,\nits value typically will increasingly move\nwith the value of the Underlying ETF. However,\nthe value of the FLEX Options prior to the\nexpiration date may vary because of related\nfactors other than the value of the Underlying\nETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nusing other recognized pricing methods.\nFactors that may influence the value of the\nFLEX Options generally include interest rate\nchanges, dividends, the actual and implied\nvolatility levels of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price, and the remaining time until the\nFLEX Options expire, among others. The value\nof the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically\ndo not increase or decrease at the same rate\nas the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price on a day-\nto-day basis due to these factors (although\nthey generally move in the same direction),\nand, as a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not\nincrease or decrease at the same rate as the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Affiliated Fund Risk. In managing the\nFund, BFA has the ability to select Underlying\nFunds and substitute Underlying Funds with\nother ETFs that it believes will achieve the\nFund\u2019s objective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest in selecting\nUnderlying Funds and substituting Underlying\nFunds with other ETFs because the fees paid to\nBFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than the fees\npaid by other Underlying Funds. This risk may\nbe reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with\nrespect to the Underlying Fund. If an\nUnderlying Fund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess of a certain\namount, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap Change Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap are dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions ( e.g. volatility, interest\nrates, dividends, and other factors). As such,\nthe Approximate Buffer S-31 and Approximate\nCap may rise or fall from one Hedge Period to\nthe next, sometimes to a significant extent,\nand are unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Hedge Periods. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, an index, or other asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized Participant\n(as defined below in Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-party investor,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, or another fund may invest in the\nFund and hold its investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund to achieve\nsize or scale. There can be no assurance that\nany such entity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of the Fund would\nbe maintained at such levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Clearing Member\nDefault Risk. Transactions in some types of\nderivatives, including FLEX Options and\nfutures, are required to be centrally cleared\n( \u201c cleared derivatives \u201d ). In a transaction\ninvolving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house, such as the\nOCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the\nFund is not a member of clearing houses and\nonly members of a clearing house ( \u201c clearing\nmembers \u201d ) can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund will hold cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives positions, the\nFund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through their accounts at\nclearing members. Customer funds held at a\nclearing organization in connection with any\noptions contracts are held in a commingled\nomnibus account and are not identified to the\nname of the clearing member\u2019s individual\ncustomers. As a result, assets deposited by\nthe Fund with any clearing member as margin\nfor FLEX Options or futures may, in certain\ncircumstances, be used to satisfy losses of\nother clients of the Fund\u2019s clearing member.\nIn addition, although clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u2019\nobligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's\nor the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there\nis a risk that the assets of the Fund might\nnot be fully protected in the event of the\nclearing member\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund\nwould be limited to recovering only a pro rata\nshare of all available funds segregated on\nbehalf of the clearing member\u2019s customers for\nthe relevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives are\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the FLEX\nOptions. As a result, the ability of the Fund\nto meet its objective depends on the OCC being\nable to meet its obligations. In the unlikely\nevent that the OCC becomes insolvent or is\notherwise unable to meet its settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. Derivatives Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns or increase volatility.\nVolatility is defined as the characteristic of\na security, an index or a market to fluctuate\nsignificantly in price within a short time\nperiod. Derivatives may also be subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of\nthe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives is that the\nfluctuations in their values may not correlate\nperfectly with the value of the underlying\nasset, the performance of the asset class to\nwhich the Fund seeks exposure or to the\nperformance of the overall securities markets.\nThe possible lack of a liquid secondary market\nfor derivatives and the resulting inability of\nthe Fund to sell or otherwise close a\nderivatives position could expose the Fund to\nlosses and could make derivatives more\ndifficult for the Fund to value accurately.\nThe Fund could also suffer losses related to\nits derivatives positions as a result of\nunanticipated market movements, which losses\nare potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives\nmay give rise to a form of leverage and may\nexpose the Fund to greater risk and increase\nits costs. To the extent that the Fund invests\nin rolling futures contracts, it may be\nsubject to additional risk. The impact of U.S.\nand global regulation of derivatives may make\nderivatives more costly, may limit the\navailability of derivatives, may delay or\nrestrict the exercise by the S-32 Fund of\ntermination rights or remedies upon a\ncounterparty default under derivatives held by\nthe Fund (which could result in losses), or\nmay otherwise adversely affect the value or\nperformance of derivatives. In addition, the\nFund's use of derivatives may expose the Fund\nto risks related to potential operational\nissues, such as documentation and settlement\nissues, systems failures, inadequate controls\nand human error. Derivatives may also involve\nlegal risks, including insufficient\ndocumentation, insufficient capacity or\nauthority of a counterparty, and legality and\nenforceability of a contract. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Futures Contract Risk.\nFutures are standardized, exchange-traded\ncontracts that obligate a purchaser to take\ndelivery, and a seller to make delivery, of a\nspecific amount of an asset at a specified\nfuture date at a specified price. Unlike\nequities, which typically entitle the holder\nto a continuing ownership stake in an issuer,\nfutures contracts normally specify a certain\ndate for settlement in cash based on the level\nof the reference rate. The primary risks\nassociated with the use of futures contracts\nare: (i) the imperfect correlation between the\nchange in market value of the instruments held\nby the Fund and the price of the futures\ncontract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid\nsecondary market for a futures contract and\nthe resulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA\u2019s inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations. Hedge\nPeriod Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to\nFund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of the Hedge Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nInvestment in the Underlying Fund Risk. The\nFund invests substantially all of its assets\nin the Underlying Fund, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance is related to the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund\u2019s\nNAV will change with changes in the value of\nthe Underlying Fund and other instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the Fund will\nentail more costs and expenses than a direct\ninvestment in the Underlying Fund. Investment\nObjective Risk. Certain circumstances under\nwhich the Fund might not achieve its objective\ninclude, but are not limited, to (i) if the\nFund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii)\nif the Fund is unable to maintain the\nproportional relationship based on the number\nof exchange-traded options in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, (iii) significant accrual of Fund\nexpenses in connection with effecting the\nFund\u2019s principal investment strategy or (iv)\nadverse tax law changes affecting the\ntreatment of FLEX Options. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses applied by BFA will not produce the\ndesired results, and that securities selected\nby BFA may underperform the market or any\nrelevant benchmark. In addition, legislative,\nregulatory, or tax developments may affect the\ninvestment techniques available to BFA in\nconnection with managing the Fund and may also\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\nachieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-33 Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Options Risk.\nInvestments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother assets decreased, remained the same or\nfailed to increase to a level at or beyond the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor increased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). If a put\nor call option purchased by the Fund were\npermitted to expire without being sold or\nexercised, its premium would represent a loss\nto the Fund. To the extent that the Fund\nwrites or sells an option, if the decline or\nincrease in the underlying asset is\nsignificantly below or above the exercise\nprice of the written option, the Fund could\nexperience a substantial loss. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s\nand the Underlying Fund's investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s or the\nUnderlying Fund's investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Tax\nRisk. The Fund intends to elect and to qualify\neach year to be treated as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) under\nSubchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue\nCode \u201d ). As a RIC, the Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its net investment income and net\ncapital gain that it distributes to\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies\ncertain requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode. However, the federal income tax\ntreatment of certain aspects of the proposed\noperations of the Fund are not entirely clear.\nThis includes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s\noptions strategy, its hedging strategy, the\npossible application of the \u201c straddle \u201d\nrules, and various loss limitation provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and\nmaintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must\nmeet certain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. In\nparticular, there is no published Internal\nRevenue Service guidance or case law on how to\ndetermine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nBased upon the language in the legislative\nhistory, the Fund intends to treat the issuer\nof the FLEX Options as the referenced asset,\nwhich, assuming the referenced asset qualifies\nas a RIC, would allow the Fund to count the\nFLEX Options as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the RIC diversification\nrequirements. The Fund intends to treat any\nincome it may derive from the FLEX Options as\n\u201c qualifying income \u201d under the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs.\nIf the income is not qualifying income or the\nissuer of the FLEX Options is not\nappropriately the referenced asset, the Fund\nmay not qualify, or may be disqualified, as a\nRIC. If the Fund does not qualify as a RIC for\nany taxable year and certain relief provisions\nare not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwill be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Upside\nParticipation Risk . There can be no guarantee\nthat the Fund will be successful in its\nstrategy to match the increase, if any, of the\nshare price return of the Underlying ETF over\na Hedge Period, subject to an Approximate Cap.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter the beginning of a Hedge Period or does\nnot stay invested in the Fund for the entirety\nof the Hedge S-34 Period, the returns realized\nby the investor may not match those that the\nFund seeks to achieve. Valuation Risk . The\nprice that the Fund could receive upon the\nsale (or other disposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. In addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers.

Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since inception (2024).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-36 More Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds. Please read this\nProspectus carefully before you make any\ninvestment decisions. Additional information\nregarding the Funds is available at\nwww.iShares.com. BFA is the investment adviser\nto the Funds. Shares of each Fund are listed\nfor trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c\nCboe BZX \u201d ). The market price for a share of\na Fund may be different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. Each Fund has its own CUSIP number\nand exchange trading symbol. Each Fund is an\nactively managed ETF and does not seek to\nreplicate the performance of a specified\nindex. Accordingly, the management team has\ndiscretion on a daily basis to manage the\nFund\u2019s portfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives. ETFs are funds that\ntrade like other publicly traded securities\nand are designed to track an index. Similar to\nshares of an index mutual fund, each share of\na Fund represents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments intended to track a market index.\nUnlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be\nbought and redeemed from the issuing fund by\nall shareholders at a price based on NAV,\nshares of the Funds may be purchased or\nredeemed directly from the Funds at NAV solely\nby Authorized Participants and only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares (\n\u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Also unlike shares of a\nmutual fund, shares of each Fund are listed on\na national securities exchange and trade in\nthe secondary market at market prices that\nchange throughout the day. Each Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Each Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective is a non-fundamental policy and may\nbe changed without shareholder approval. Each\nFund\u2019s 80% investment policy is non-\nfundamental and may be changed without\nshareholder approval upon 60 days\u2019 prior\nwritten notice to shareholders. A Further\nDiscussion of Principal Investment Strategies\nOverview iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Mar ETF\nThe Fund seeks to provide exposure to the\nshare price return of the Underlying ETF up to\nan approximate upside limit (the \u201c Approximate\nCap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize the\ndownside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, which measures the\nperformance of the large-capitalization sector\nof the U.S. equity market, as determined by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nweighted based on the float-adjusted market\nvalue of their outstanding shares. The\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index consists of securities\nfrom a broad range of industries. The\ncomponents of the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Underlying ETF and\nreceives a management fee from the Underlying\nETF. The Underlying ETF is managed using a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nUnderlying ETF may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index,\nwhich may cause the performance of the\nUnderlying ETF to diverge from that of the\nUnderlying ETF's Index. Representative\nsampling may subject the Underlying ETF to \u201c\ntracking error \u201d , which is the divergence of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s performance from that of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nThe prospectus and other reports of the\nUnderlying ETF (Ticker: IVV) are available on\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov . Shares of the\nUnderlying ETF are listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. 1\nAn options contract is an agreement between a\nbuyer and seller that gives the purchaser of\nthe option the right but not the obligation to\nbuy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in\nthe case of a put option) a particular\nfinancial instrument at a specified future\ndate for an agreed upon price (commonly known\nas the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If the Fund\npurchases a call option, the Fund pays a\npremium and receives the right, but not the\nobligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (April 1 through March 31),\nsubject to the annual rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s market value\nand NAV may not correlate with the Underlying\nETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, especially\nduring each Hedge Period. The strike prices\nfor the capped calls will change for each\nHedge Period depending on the prevailing\nmarket conditions and the cost of the put\noption for that Hedge Period, resulting in a\ndifferent Approximate Cap for each Hedge\nPeriod. The Fund will typically buy Underlying\nETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex and seek to enter into the combination\nof options transactions described above if\nthere are any inflows, or creation\ntransactions, during a Hedge Period. This will\noccur even in circumstances where the Fund\nwould receive a negligible premium for writing\nan out-of-the-money call which may potentially\ngive up more sizable returns to the extent\nthat the option later becomes in the money.\nBecause the Fund will effectively use\ndistributions from the Underlying ETF to\npurchase the downside protection, the Fund\u2019s\nperformance is likely to be less than the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance when (1)\ndistributions are considered and (2) the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance is positive. In\norder to obtain economic exposure to the\nUnderlying ETF, in lieu of purchasing\nUnderlying ETF shares and futures on the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index for a Hedge Period, the\nFund may instead, among other things: purchase\ncall options with a strike price that is very\nlow (approximately 1% or less) relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price on the day of\npurchase (a \u201c zero strike call \u201d ); purchase\none or more other ETFs that seek to track the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index; purchase equity\nsecurities (e.g., component securities of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index) in seeking to track\nthe share price return of the Underlying ETF;\nor invest in U.S. treasuries, money market\nfunds and/or other cash equivalents and\npurchase or sell a combination of call and put\noptions that seek to synthesize the economic\ncharacteristics of the Underlying ETF. If the\nFund invests in equity securities (other than\nthe Underlying ETF), the Fund\u2019s equity\nsecurity investments will be primarily in\ncommon stocks of companies held by the\nUnderlying ETF that BFA believes will provide\na risk/ return profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying ETF. For the current Hedge Period\nof April 1 through March 31, the Approximate\nCap is [__]% prior to taking into account any\nfees or expenses charged to or transaction\ncosts incurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF.\nWhen the Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of\n0.50% of the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets\nis taken into account, the Approximate Cap for\nthe current Hedge Period is reduced to [__]%.\nThe returns that the Fund seeks to provide\nalso do not include the costs associated with\npurchasing shares of the Fund. The Approximate\nBuffer that the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide is against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod; however, there is no guarantee that\nthe Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For 2 example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund\u2019s\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). iShares Large Cap Max\nBuffer Jun ETF The Fund seeks to provide\nexposure to the share price return of the\nUnderlying ETF up to an approximate upside\nlimit (the \u201c Approximate Cap \u201d ), while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst Underlying ETF losses (the \u201c\nApproximate Buffer \u201d ) over each annual Hedge\nPeriod (as defined below).

Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (July 1 through June 30),\nsubject to the annual rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s market value\nand NAV may not correlate with the Underlying\nETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, especially\nduring each Hedge Period. The strike prices\nfor the capped calls will change for each\nHedge Period depending on the prevailing\nmarket conditions and the cost of the put\noption for that Hedge Period, resulting in a\ndifferent Approximate Cap for each Hedge\nPeriod. The Fund will typically buy Underlying\nETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex and seek to enter into the combination\nof options transactions described above if\nthere are any inflows, or creation\ntransactions, during a Hedge Period. This will\noccur even in circumstances where the Fund\nwould receive a negligible premium for writing\nan out-of-the-money call which may potentially\ngive up more sizable returns to the extent\nthat the option later becomes in the money.\nBecause the Fund will effectively use\ndistributions from the Underlying ETF to\npurchase the downside protection, the Fund\u2019s\nperformance is likely to be less than the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance when (1)\ndistributions are considered and (2) the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance is positive. In\norder to obtain economic exposure to the\nUnderlying ETF, in lieu of purchasing\nUnderlying ETF shares and futures on the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index for a Hedge Period, the\nFund may instead, among other things: purchase\ncall options with a strike price that is very\nlow (approximately 1% or less) relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price on the day of\npurchase (a \u201c zero strike call \u201d ); purchase\none or more other ETFs that seek to track the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index; purchase equity\nsecurities (e.g., component securities of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index) in seeking to track\nthe share price return of the Underlying ETF;\nor invest in U.S. treasuries, money market\nfunds and/or other cash equivalents and\npurchase or sell a combination of call and put\noptions that seek to synthesize the economic\ncharacteristics of the Underlying ETF. If the\nFund invests in equity securities (other than\nthe Underlying ETF), the Fund\u2019s equity\nsecurity investments will be primarily in\ncommon stocks of companies held by the\nUnderlying ETF that BFA believes will provide\na risk/ return profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying ETF. For the current Hedge Period\nof July 1 through June 30, the Approximate Cap\nis 111.14% prior to taking into account any\nfees or expenses charged to or transaction\ncosts incurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF.\nWhen the Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of\n0.50% of the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets\nis taken into account, the Approximate Cap for\nthe current Hedge Period is reduced to\n110.64%. The returns that the Fund seeks to\nprovide also do not include the costs\nassociated with purchasing shares of the Fund.\nThe Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically\nseeks to provide is against approximately 100%\nof Underlying ETF losses for the applicable\nHedge Period; however, there is no guarantee\nthat the Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\n4 the Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund\u2019s\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). iShares Large Cap Max\nBuffer Sep ETF The Fund seeks to provide\nexposure to the share price return of the\nUnderlying ETF up to an approximate upside\nlimit (the \u201c Approximate Cap \u201d ), while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst Underlying ETF losses (the \u201c\nApproximate Buffer \u201d ) over each annual Hedge\nPeriod (as defined below). Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of\nits net assets (plus any borrowings for\ninvestment purposes) in securities or other\ninstruments that provide exposure to\nsecurities of large capitalization companies\nor that provide for the upside limit on gains\nor the downside protection against the losses\nof securities of large capitalization\ncompanies.

Information on the Approximate Cap\nand Approximate Buffer will be provided\nshortly before each Hedge Period. The\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap for a\nHedge Period only apply to Fund shares held\nover the entire Hedge Period. An investor that\npurchases Fund shares after the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, or sells Fund shares before\nthe end of a Hedge Period, may not fully\nrealize the Approximate Buffer or Approximate\nCap for the Hedge Period and may be exposed to\ngreater risk of loss and less potential gain.\nThis is because while the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period are\nfixed levels that are calculated in relation\nto the Underlying ETF price and the Fund\u2019s NAV\nat the start of each Hedge Period and\ngenerally remain constant throughout the Hedge\nPeriod, an investor purchasing Fund shares at\nmarket price during the Hedge Period likely\npurchased Fund shares at a price that is\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of\nthe Hedge Period ( i.e. , the NAV that the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nreference). For example, if an investor\npurchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at\na time when the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price\nhas increased from its price at the beginning\nof the Hedge Period, the investor\u2019s upside\nlimit may be lower than the Approximate Cap\nand the investor may experience losses prior\nto reaching the downside protection offered by\nthe Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares during a Hedge\nPeriod at a time when the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price has decreased from its price at\nthe beginning of the Hedge Period, the Fund\nmay require a larger increase in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price before it reaches\nthe Approximate Cap. The Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer, and the Fund\u2019s position\nrelative to each, which are typically\navailable on iShares.com daily, should be\nconsidered before investing in the Fund. In\nperiods of extreme market volatility, the\nFund\u2019s return may be subject to an upside\nlimit significantly below the Approximate Cap\nand downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer.

The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (January 1 through December\n31), subject to the annual rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s market value\nand NAV may not correlate with the Underlying\nETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, especially\nduring each Hedge Period. The strike prices\nfor the capped calls will change for each\nHedge Period depending on the prevailing\nmarket conditions and the cost of the put\noption for that Hedge Period, resulting in a\ndifferent Approximate Cap for each Hedge\nPeriod. The Fund will typically buy Underlying\nETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex and seek to enter into the combination\nof options transactions described above if\nthere are any inflows, or creation\ntransactions, during a Hedge Period. This will\noccur even in circumstances where the Fund\nwould receive a negligible premium for writing\nan out-of-the-money call which may potentially\ngive up more sizable returns to the extent\nthat the option later becomes in the money.\nBecause the Fund will effectively use\ndistributions from the Underlying ETF to\npurchase the downside protection, the Fund\u2019s\nperformance is likely to be less than the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance when (1)\ndistributions are considered and (2) the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance is positive. In\norder to obtain economic exposure to the\nUnderlying ETF, in lieu of purchasing\nUnderlying ETF shares and futures on the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index for a Hedge Period, the\nFund may instead, among other things: purchase\ncall options with a strike price that is very\nlow (approximately 1% or less) relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price on the day of\npurchase (a \u201c zero strike call \u201d ); purchase\none or more other ETFs that seek to track the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index; purchase equity\nsecurities (e.g., component securities of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index) in seeking to track\nthe share price return of the Underlying ETF;\nor invest in U.S. treasuries, money market\nfunds and/or other cash equivalents and\npurchase or sell a combination of call and put\noptions that seek to synthesize the economic\ncharacteristics of the Underlying ETF. If the\nFund invests in equity securities (other than\nthe Underlying ETF), the Fund\u2019s equity\nsecurity investments will be primarily in\ncommon stocks of companies held by the\nUnderlying ETF that BFA believes will provide\na risk/ return profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying ETF. For the current Hedge Period\nof January 1 through December 31, the\nApproximate Cap is [__]% prior to taking into\naccount any fees or expenses charged to or\ntransaction costs incurred by the Fund or\nUnderlying ETF. When the Fund\u2019s annualized\nmanagement fee of 0.50% of the Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets is taken into account, the\nApproximate Cap for the current Hedge Period\nis reduced to [__]%. The returns that the Fund\nseeks to provide also do not include the costs\nassociated with purchasing shares of the Fund.\n8 The Approximate Buffer that the Fund\ntypically seeks to provide is against\napproximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses\nfor the applicable Hedge Period; however,\nthere is no guarantee that the Approximate\nBuffer will succeed in providing the intended\nprotection. The Approximate Buffer is provided\nprior to taking into account any fees or\nexpenses charged to the Fund. These fees and\nany expenses will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer amount for Fund shareholders for a\nHedge Period. When the Fund\u2019s annual\nmanagement fee equal to 0.50% of the Fund\u2019s\ndaily net assets is taken into account for a\nHedge Period, the net Approximate Buffer for\nthe Hedge Period is 99.5%. While the Fund\ntypically seeks to provide against\napproximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses\nfor the applicable Hedge Period and will\nmaximize the Approximate Buffer, the Fund will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer, including below\n100%, to provide an Approximate Cap of at\nleast 2%. For example, if interest rates are\nlow enough that providing against\napproximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses\nwould result in an Approximate Cap of less\nthan 2%, the Fund would decrease the\nprotection such that the Approximate Cap is at\nleast 2%. Information on the Approximate Cap\nand Approximate Buffer will be provided\nshortly before each Hedge Period. The\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap for a\nHedge Period only apply to Fund shares held\nover the entire Hedge Period. An investor that\npurchases Fund shares after the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, or sells Fund shares before\nthe end of a Hedge Period, may not fully\nrealize the Approximate Buffer or Approximate\nCap for the Hedge Period and may be exposed to\ngreater risk of loss and less potential gain.\nThis is because while the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period are\nfixed levels that are calculated in relation\nto the Underlying ETF price and the Fund\u2019s NAV\nat the start of each Hedge Period and\ngenerally remain constant throughout the Hedge\nPeriod, an investor purchasing Fund shares at\nmarket price during the Hedge Period likely\npurchased Fund shares at a price that is\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of\nthe Hedge Period ( i.e. , the NAV that the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nreference). For example, if an investor\npurchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at\na time when the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price\nhas increased from its price at the beginning\nof the Hedge Period, the investor\u2019s upside\nlimit may be lower than the Approximate Cap\nand the investor may experience losses prior\nto reaching the downside protection offered by\nthe Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an\ninvestor purchases Fund shares during a Hedge\nPeriod at a time when the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price has decreased from its price at\nthe beginning of the Hedge Period, the Fund\nmay require a larger increase in the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price before it reaches\nthe Approximate Cap. The Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer, and the Fund\u2019s position\nrelative to each, which are typically\navailable on iShares.com daily, should be\nconsidered before investing in the Fund. In\nperiods of extreme market volatility, the\nFund\u2019s return may be subject to an upside\nlimit significantly below the Approximate Cap\nand downside protection significantly lower\nthan the Approximate Buffer. An investor may\nlose their entire investment and an investment\nin the Fund is only appropriate for investors\nwilling to bear those losses. Following the\nclose of business on the last day of each\nHedge Period, the Fund will file a prospectus\nsupplement that discloses the Fund\u2019s\nApproximate Cap (gross and net of the unitary\nmanagement fee) for the next Hedge Period. The\nFund\u2019s Approximate Cap (net of the unitary\nmanagement fee) for the current Hedge Period,\nalong with Fund\u2019s position relative to the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap, will\nbe available on the Fund\u2019s website,\nwww.iShares.com . The Fund is classified as\nnon-diversified under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). A\nFurther Discussion of Principal Risks Each\nFund is subject to various risks, including\nthe principal risks noted below, any of which\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV, trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each Fund may be\nexposed to these risks directly or indirectly\nthrough the Fund's investments in the\nUnderlying Fund. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in the Funds, and the Funds\ncould underperform other investments. The\norder of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor. Each Fund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at www.iShares.com. Affiliated\nFund Risk. In managing the Funds, BFA has the\nability to select Underlying Funds and\nsubstitute Underlying Funds with other ETFs\nthat it believes will achieve each Fund\u2019s\nobjective. BFA may be subject to potential\nconflicts of interest in selecting Underlying\nFunds and substituting Underlying Funds with\nother ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by\nsome Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed\nby BFA may be higher than the fees paid by\nother Underlying Funds. This risk may be\nreduced to the extent BFA has agreed to waive\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses with respect\nto the Underlying Fund. If an Underlying Fund\nor other ETF holds interests in an affiliated\nfund, the Funds may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap Change Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap are dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions ( e.g. volatility, interest\nrates, dividends, and other factors). As such,\nthe Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap may\nrise or fall from one Hedge Period to the\nnext, sometimes to a significant extent, and\nare unlikely to remain the same for\nconsecutive Hedge Periods. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nindexes that track, or assets that represent,\nother countries or geographic units,\nindustries, markets, market segments, or asset\nclasses. Various types of securities, other\nassets and indexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. 9 Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk. From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party investor, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser, or\nanother fund may invest in a Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith a Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for a Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater settlement and\noperational complexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized Participants, which may\nlimit the number of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Buffered Loss Risk.\nThere can be no guarantee that the Fund will\nbe successful in its strategy to provide\ndownside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses. The Fund does not provide principal\nprotection or non-principal protection, and,\ndespite the Approximate Buffer, an investor\nmay experience significant losses on their\ninvestment, including the loss of their entire\ninvestment. In the event an investor purchases\nFund shares after a Hedge Period begins or\nsells Fund shares prior to the end of the\nHedge Period, the Approximate Buffer that the\nFund seeks to provide may not be available. In\nperiods of extreme market volatility, the\nFund\u2019s return may be subject to downside\nprotection significantly lower than the\nApproximate Buffer. Capped Upside Return Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s strategy seeks to provide returns\nthat are subject to an Approximate Cap. The\nApproximate Cap represents an approximate\nmaximum percentage return that an investor can\nachieve from an investment in the Fund held\nover an entire Hedge Period. In the event that\nthe Underlying ETF experiences gains in excess\nof the upside limit to which the Fund is\nsubject as a result of the capped call for a\nHedge Period, the Fund will not participate in\nthose gains beyond the upside limit. In the\nevent an investor purchases Fund shares after\na Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares\nprior to the end of a Hedge Period, there may\nbe little or no ability for that investor to\nexperience an investment gain on their Fund\nshares. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap. Clearing Member Default Risk.\nTransactions in some types of derivatives,\nincluding FLEX Options and futures, are\nrequired to be centrally cleared ( \u201c cleared\nderivatives \u201d ). In a transaction involving\ncleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s counterparty\nis a clearing house, such as the OCC, rather\nthan a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a\nmember of clearing houses and only members of\na clearing house ( \u201c clearing members \u201d ) can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund will hold cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives positions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\ntheir accounts at clearing members. Customer\nfunds held at a clearing organization in\nconnection with any options contracts are held\nin a commingled omnibus account and are not\nidentified to the name of the clearing\nmember\u2019s individual customers. As a result,\nassets deposited by the Fund with any clearing\nmember as margin for FLEX Options or futures\nmay, in certain circumstances, be used to\nsatisfy losses of other clients of the Fund\u2019s\nclearing member. In addition, although\nclearing members guarantee performance of\ntheir clients\u2019 obligations to the Underlying\nETF, the Fund's or the Underlying ETF's\nclearing house, there is a risk that the\nassets of the Fund might not be fully\nprotected in the event of the clearing\nmember\u2019s bankruptcy, as the Fund would be\nlimited to recovering only a pro rata share of\nall available funds segregated on behalf of\nthe clearing member\u2019s customers for the\nrelevant account class. The Fund is also\nsubject to the risk that a limited number of\nclearing members are willing to transact on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf, which heightens the risks\nassociated with a clearing member\u2019s default.\nIf a clearing member defaults, the Fund could\nlose some or all of the benefits of a\ntransaction entered into by the Fund with the\nclearing member. If the Fund cannot find a\nclearing member to transact with on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf, the Fund may be unable to effectively\nimplement its investment strategy.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund may be susceptible\nto an increased risk of loss, including losses\ndue to adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be more adversely\naffected by the underperformance of those\nassets, may experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more susceptible to\nadverse economic, market, political or\nregulatory impacts on those assets compared to\na fund that does not concentrate its\ninvestments. Counterparty Risk. Derivatives\nare subject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill be unable or unwilling to fulfill its\ncontractual obligation, and the related risks\nof having concentrated exposure to such a\ncounterparty. The OCC acts as guarantor and\ncentral counterparty with respect to the FLEX\nOptions. As a result, the ability of the Fund\nto meet its objective depends on the OCC being\nable to meet its obligations. In the unlikely\nevent that the OCC becomes insolvent or is\notherwise unable to meet its settlement\nobligations, the Fund could suffer significant\nlosses. Cybersecurity Risk. A Fund and\nentities that interact with the Fund are\nsusceptible to operational, information\nsecurity and related cybersecurity risks, both\ndirectly and through their service providers.\nThese entities include, but are not limited\nto, a Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor, other\nservice providers ( e.g ., index and benchmark\nproviders, accountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators), counterparties,\nmarket makers, Authorized Participants,\nlisting exchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental authorities.\nCybersecurity risks are also present for\nissuers of securities or other assets in which\na Fund invests, which could result in material\nadverse 10 consequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment in such\nissuers to lose value. Cyber incidents can\nresult from deliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They include, but are\nnot limited to, gaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract, the value\nof which depends on or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset such as a\nsecurity or an index. Each Fund and Underlying\nFund may invest in certain types of\nderivatives contracts, including futures,\noptions and swaps. Compared to conventional\nsecurities, derivatives can be more sensitive\nto changes in interest rates or to sudden\nfluctuations in market prices and thus a\nFund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's losses may be\ngreater if it invests in derivatives than if\nit invests only in conventional securities.\nEquity Securities Risk. Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value due to general\nmarket or economic conditions, perceptions\nabout the markets in which issuers participate\nor a number of factors relating to a specific\nissuer. Investments in equity securities may\nbe more volatile than investments in other\nasset classes. Equity securities (both common\nand preferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. FLEX Options Risk . In\naddition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options\nare subject to the risk that they may be less\nliquid than certain other securities, such as\nstandardized options. In less liquid markets\nfor the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX\nOptions may require the payment of a premium\nor acceptance of a discounted price and may\ntake longer to complete. In a less liquid\nmarket for the FLEX Options, the liquidation\nof a large number of options may significantly\nimpact the price of the options and may\nadversely impact the value of your investment.\nAdditionally, to the extent market\nparticipants are not willing or able to enter\ninto FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at\nprices that reflect the market price of the\nFund shares, the Fund\u2019s NAV and, in turn the\nshare price of the Fund, could be negatively\nimpacted. The FLEX Options held by the Fund\nwill be exercisable at the strike price only\non their expiration date. As an in-the-money\nFLEX Option approaches its expiration date,\nits value typically will increasingly move\nwith the value of the Underlying ETF. However,\nthe value of the FLEX Options prior to the\nexpiration date may vary because of related\nfactors other than the value of the Underlying\nETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be\ndetermined based upon market quotations or\nusing other recognized pricing methods.\nFactors that may influence the value of the\nFLEX Options generally include interest rate\nchanges, dividends, the actual and implied\nvolatility levels of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price, and the remaining time until the\nFLEX Options expire, among others. The value\nof the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically\ndo not increase or decrease at the same rate\nas the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price on a day-\nto-day basis due to these factors (although\nthey generally move in the same direction),\nand, as a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may not\nincrease or decrease at the same rate as the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. Futures Contract\nRisk. Futures are standardized, exchange-\ntraded contracts that obligate a purchaser to\ntake delivery, and a seller to make delivery,\nof a specific amount of an asset at a\nspecified future date at a specified price.\nUnlike equities, which typically entitle the\nholder to a continuing ownership stake in an\nissuer, futures contracts normally specify a\ncertain date for settlement in cash based on\nthe level of the reference rate. The primary\nrisks associated with the use of futures\ncontracts are: (i) the imperfect correlation\nbetween the change in market value of the\ninstruments held by the Fund and the price of\nthe futures contract; (ii) possible lack of a\nliquid secondary market for a futures contract\nand the resulting inability to close a futures\ncontract when desired; (iii) losses caused by\nunanticipated market movements, which are\npotentially unlimited; (iv) BFA's inability to\npredict correctly the direction of prices and\nother economic factors; and (v) the\npossibility that the counterparty will default\nin the performance of its obligations. Hedge\nPeriod Risk. The Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to\nFund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.\nIn the event an investor purchases Fund shares\nafter a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund\nshares prior to the end of the Hedge Period,\nthe returns realized by the investor will not\nmatch those that the Fund seeks to provide.\nInvestment Objective Risk. Certain\ncircumstances under which the Fund might not\nachieve its objective include, but are not\nlimited, to (i) if the Fund disposes of\nexchange-traded options, (ii) if the Fund is\nunable to maintain the proportional\nrelationship based on the number of exchange-\ntraded options in the Fund\u2019s portfolio, (iii)\nsignificant accrual of Fund expenses in\nconnection with effecting the Fund\u2019s principal\ninvestment strategy or (iv) adverse tax law\nchanges affecting the treatment of FLEX\nOptions. 11 Investment in the Underlying Fund\nRisk. Each Fund invests substantially all of\nits assets in the Underlying Fund, so each\nFund\u2019s investment performance is related to\nthe performance of the Underlying Fund. Each\nFund may also invest in other funds, including\nmoney market funds. Each Fund\u2019s NAV will\nchange with changes in the value of the\nUnderlying Fund and other instruments in which\neach Fund invests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in a Fund will\nentail more direct and indirect costs and\nexpenses than a direct investment in the\nUnderlying Fund. For example, in addition to\nthe expenses of a Fund, a Fund indirectly pays\na portion of the expenses (including operating\nexpenses and management fees) incurred by the\nUnderlying Fund, although some of such fees\nwill be offset by the fee waiver by BFA. An\ninvestor in a Fund may receive taxable gains\nfrom portfolio transactions by the Underlying\nFund, as well as taxable gains from\ntransactions in shares of the Underlying Fund\nheld by the Fund. Issuer Risk. The performance\nof a Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Management Risk. An\nactive Fund is subject to management risk\nbecause it does not seek to replicate the\nperformance of a specified index. BFA and the\nportfolio managers will utilize a proprietary\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses in making investment decisions for a\nFund, but there can be no guarantee that these\ndecisions will produce the desired results. In\naddition, legislative, regulatory, or tax\ndevelopments may affect the investment\ntechniques available to BFA in connection with\nmanaging a Fund and may also adversely affect\nthe ability of a Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market Risk. A Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. The value of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to changes in\ngeneral market conditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically related to\nthe particular instrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on a Fund and its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or discounts to a\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and economic\nconditions generally do not have the same\nimpact on all types of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces numerous\nmarket trading risks, any of which may lead to\nits shares trading in the secondary market at\na premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Absence of an Active Primary Market.\nAlthough Fund shares are listed for trading on\none or more stock exchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary trading\nmarket for Fund shares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Secondary Listing Risks. A\nFund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded on U.S.\nand non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nU.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s primary\nlisting is maintained. Fund shares also may be\navailable to non-U.S. investors through funds\nor structured investment vehicles similar to\ndepositary receipts. There can be no assurance\nthat a Fund\u2019s shares will continue to trade on\nany such stock 12 exchange or in any market or\nthat a Fund\u2019s shares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing or market\ntrading. A Fund\u2019s shares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the execution and\nsettlement risks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker direct their\ntrades for execution. Certain information that\nis available to investors who trade Fund\nshares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be available to\ninvestors who trade in other markets, which\nmay result in secondary market prices in such\nmarkets being less efficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund may trade in\nthe secondary market at times when the Fund\ndoes not accept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may trade in the\nsecondary market with more significant\npremiums or discounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the Fund accepts\ncreation and redemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in markets that\nclose at a different time than an exchange on\nwhich Fund shares are traded. Liquidity in\nthose securities may be reduced after the\napplicable closing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is open but after\nthe applicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Non-Diversification Risk. A\nFund that is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nmay invest a greater percentage of its assets\nin securities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified. \u201d A non-\ndiversified Fund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with these particular\nissuers or counterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have a greater\nimpact on a non-diversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the performance of a\ndiversified Fund, and a non-diversified Fund\u2019s\nNAV may be more volatile. Operational Risk.\nEach Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. Each Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. 13 Options\nRisk. Investments in options are considered\nspeculative. When the Fund purchases an\noption, it may lose the total premium paid for\nit if the price of the underlying security or\nother assets decreased, remained the same or\nfailed to increase to a level at or beyond the\nexercise price (in the case of a call option)\nor increased, remained the same or failed to\ndecrease to a level at or below the exercise\nprice (in the case of a put option). If a put\nor call option purchased by the Fund were\npermitted to expire without being sold or\nexercised, its premium would represent a loss\nto the Fund. To the extent that the Fund\nwrites or sells an option, if the decline or\nincrease in the underlying asset is\nsignificantly below or above the exercise\nprice of the written option, the Fund could\nexperience a substantial loss. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries. Investment\nin developed country issuers will subject a\nFund or the Underlying Fund to regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries generally tend\nto rely on services sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the primary\nmeans of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown\nin one or more services sectors is likely to\nhave a negative impact on economies of certain\ndeveloped countries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries can be impacted\nby slowdowns in other sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have been targets\nof terrorism, and some geographic areas in\nwhich the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests\nhave experienced strained international\nrelations due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the financial markets in\nthese countries or geographic areas and may\nadversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which a Fund or the Underlying Fund\nhas exposure. Heavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and product markets,\nmay have an adverse effect on certain issuers.\nSuch regulations may negatively affect\neconomic growth or cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed countries are\nheavily indebted and face rising healthcare\nand retirement expenses. In addition, price\nfluctuations of certain commodities and\nregulations impacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Risk of Investing in the\nU.S. Investing in U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports, changes in\ntrade regulations, inflation, an economic\nrecession, financial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other risks, may have\nan adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S. exchanges. The U.S.\nis also subject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts, earthquakes,\nfires and floods. U.S. security risks include\nacts of terrorism, internal unrest and a\ndeterioration in relations between the U.S.\nand certain countries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S. economy, financial\nmarkets or issuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will maintain elevated\npublic debt levels for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough elevated debt levels do not\nnecessarily indicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing such debt may\nconstrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ), which is the securities lending\nagent for the iShares/BlackRock ETFs, will\ntake into account the tax impact to Fund\nshareholders of substitute payments for\ndividends when managing the securities lending\nprogram. Small Fund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s size\nis small, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. If a Fund were\nrequired to delist from the listing exchange,\nthe Fund\u2019s value may rapidly decline and its\nperformance may be negatively impacted. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could lead\nto elevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Tax Risk. The Fund intends to\nelect and to qualify each year to be treated\nas a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code. As a RIC, the Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its net investment income and net\ncapital gain that it distributes to\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies\ncertain requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode. However, the federal income tax\ntreatment of certain aspects of the proposed\noperations of the Fund are not entirely clear.\nThis includes the tax aspects of the Fund\u2019s\noptions strategy, its hedging strategy, the\npossible application of the \u201c straddle \u201d\nrules, and various loss limitation provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and\nmaintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must\nmeet certain income, diversification and\ndistributions tests. For purposes of the\ndiversification test, the identification of\nthe issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a\nparticular Fund investment can depend on the\nterms and conditions of that investment. There\nis no published Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201c IRS \u201d ) guidance or case law on how to\ndetermine the \u201c issuer \u201d of certain\nderivatives that the Fund will enter into.\nTherefore, there is a risk that the Fund will\nnot meet the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s\ndiversification requirements and will not\nqualify, or will be disqualified, as a RIC.\nThe Fund intends to treat the issuer of the\nFLEX Options as the referenced asset, which,\nassuming the referenced asset qualifies as a\nRIC, would allow the Fund to count the FLEX\nOptions as automatically diversified\ninvestments under the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s\ndiversification requirements. In addition, the\nFund intends to treat any income it may derive\nfrom the FLEX Options as \u201c qualifying income \u201d\nunder the provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode applicable to RICs. If the income is not\nqualifying income or if the FLEX Options are\nnot treated as issued by the reference asset\nfor diversification test purposes, there is a\nrisk that the Fund could lose its RIC status.\nIf the Fund did not qualify as a RIC for any\ntaxable year and certain relief provisions\nwere not available, the Fund\u2019s taxable income\nwould be subject to tax at the Fund level and\nto a further tax at the shareholder level when\nsuch income is distributed. In such event, in\norder to re-qualify for taxation as a RIC, the\nFund might be required to recognize unrealized\ngains, pay substantial taxes and interest and\nmake certain distributions. This would cause\ninvestors to incur higher tax liabilities than\nthey 14 otherwise would have incurred and\nwould have a negative impact on Fund returns.\nIn such event, the Fund may reorganize, close\nor materially change its investment objective\nand strategies. The Fund\u2019s investments in\noffsetting positions with respect to the\nUnderlying ETF may affect the character of\ngains or losses realized by the Fund under the\nInternal Revenue Code\u2019s \u201c straddle \u201d rules and\nmay increase the amount of short-term capital\ngain realized by the Fund. Such short-term\ncapital gain is taxed as ordinary income when\ndistributed to U.S. shareholders in a non-\nliquidating distribution. As a result, if the\nFund makes a non-liquidating distribution of\nits short-term capital gain, the amount which\nU.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be increased substantially as\ncompared to the Fund that did not engage in\nsuch transactions. Accordingly, shareholders\ncould have a lower after-tax return from\ninvesting in the Fund than investing directly\nin the Underlying ETF. The FLEX Options\nincluded in the Fund\u2019s portfolio are exchange-\ntraded options. The tax treatment of certain\nderivatives contracts including listed non-\nequity options written or purchased by the\nFund on U.S. exchanges (such as options on\nfutures contracts, broad-based equity indices\nand debt securities) may be governed by\nSection 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code ( \u201c\nSection 1256 Contracts \u201d ). Section 1256\nContracts are treated as if they were sold\n(i.e., \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at the end of\neach year. Gain or loss is recognized on this\ndeemed sale. Such treatment could cause the\nFund to recognize taxable income without\nreceiving cash. In order to maintain its RIC\nqualification, the Fund must distribute at\nleast 90% of its income annually. If FLEX\nOptions held by the Fund are subject to\nSection 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code, and\nthe Fund is unable to distribute marked-to-\nmarket gains to its shareholders, the Fund may\nlose its RIC qualification and be taxed as a\nregular corporation. BFA believes that the\nFLEX Options typically held in its portfolio\n(i.e., FLEX Options that reference the iShares\nCore S&P 500 ETF) will not be subject to\nSection 1256, and disposition of such options\nwill likely result in short-term capital gains\nor losses. Additionally, buying securities\nshortly before the record date for a taxable\ndividend or capital gain distribution is\ncommonly known as \u201c buying a dividend. \u201d If a\nshareholder purchases Fund shares after the\nHedge Period has begun and shortly thereafter\nthe Fund issues a dividend, the entire\ndistribution may be taxable to the shareholder\neven though a portion of the distribution\neffectively represents a return of the\npurchase price. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Upside Participation\nRisk. There can be no guarantee that the Fund\nwill be successful in its strategy to match\nthe increase, if any, of the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF over a Hedge\nPeriod, subject to an Approximate Cap. In the\nevent an investor purchases Fund shares after\nthe beginning of a Hedge Period or does not\nstay invested in a Fund for the entirety of\nthe Hedge Period, the returns realized by the\ninvestor may not match those that the Fund\nseeks to achieve. Valuation Risk. The price\nthat a Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. Because\nnon-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on\ndays or during time periods when a Fund does\nnot price its shares, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when a Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. A Further Discussion\nof Other Risks Each Fund may also be subject\nto certain other risks associated with its\ninvestments and investment strategies. The\norder of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor. Close-Out Risk for Qualified\nFinancial Contracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of U.S. or\nforeign global systemically important banking\norganizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Communication Services\nSector Risk. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group 15 include providers\nof fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and\nwireless telecommunications networks.\nCompanies in the media and entertainment\nindustry group encompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products, social media,\nnetworking platforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and Internet search\nengines. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected by industry\ncompetition, substantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and obsolescence of\ncommunications products and services due to\ntechnological advancement. Fluctuating\ndomestic and international demand, shifting\ndemographics and often unpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.\nThe success of consumer product manufacturers\nand retailers is tied closely to the\nperformance of domestic and international\neconomies, interest rates, exchange rates,\nsupply chains, competition, consumer\nconfidence, changes in demographics and\nconsumer preferences. Companies in the\nconsumer discretionary sector depend heavily\non disposable household income and consumer\nspending, and may be strongly affected by\nsocial trends and marketing campaigns. These\ncompanies may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact\non their profitability. Consumer Staples\nSector Risk. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be affected by the regulation of\nvarious product components and production\nmethods, marketing campaigns and changes in\nthe global economy, consumer spending and\nconsumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related\ncompanies, in particular, may be adversely\naffected by new laws, regulations and\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges or trends in commodity prices, which\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors.\nThese companies may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact\non their profitability. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of dividend-paying stocks will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect a Fund\nwith such holdings. In addition, the value of\ndividend-paying stocks can decline when\ninterest rates rise, as fixed-income\ninvestments become more attractive to\ninvestors. Financials Sector Risk. Companies\nin the financials sector are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may adversely affect the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and, potentially,\ntheir size. Governmental regulation may change\nfrequently and may have significant adverse\nconsequences for companies in the financials\nsector, including effects not intended by such\nregulation. Increased risk taking by financial\ncompanies may also result in greater overall\nrisk in the U.S. and global financials sector.\nThe impact of changes in capital requirements,\nor recent or future regulation in various\ncountries, on any individual financial company\nor on the financials sector as a whole cannot\nbe predicted. Certain risks may impact the\nvalue of investments in the financials sector\nmore severely than those of investments\noutside this sector, including the risks\nassociated with companies that operate with\nsubstantial financial leverage. Companies in\nthe financials sector are exposed directly to\nthe credit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through 16 swaps and\nother derivatives products. Financial services\ncompanies may have significant exposure to the\nsame borrowers and counterparties, with the\nresult that a borrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\ninability to meet its obligations to one\ncompany may affect other companies with\nexposure to the same borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nCompanies in the financials sector may also be\nadversely affected by increases in interest\nrates and loan losses, decreases in the\navailability of money or asset valuations,\ncredit rating downgrades, adverse public\nperception and adverse conditions in other\nrelated markets. Insurance companies, in\nparticular, may be subject to severe price\ncompetition and/or rate regulation, which may\nhave an adverse impact on their profitability.\nThe financials sector is particularly\nsensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe financials sector is also a target for\ncyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and\ntechnology malfunctions and failures have\nbecome increasingly frequent and have caused\nsignificant losses to companies in this\nsector, which may negatively impact a Fund.\nThe extent to which the Fund may invest in a\ncompany that engages in securities-related\nactivities or banking is limited by applicable\nlaw. Healthcare Sector Risk. The profitability\nof companies in the healthcare sector may be\nadversely affected by the following factors,\namong others: extensive government\nregulations, restrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services,\npricing pressure, an increased emphasis on\noutpatient services, changes in the demand for\nmedical products and services, a limited\nnumber of products, industry innovation,\nchanges in technologies and other market\ndevelopments. Many healthcare companies are\nheavily dependent on patent protection. The\nexpiration of a company\u2019s patents may\nadversely affect that company\u2019s profitability.\nMany healthcare companies are subject to\nextensive litigation based on product\nliability and similar claims. Healthcare\ncompanies are subject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to raise prices\nand, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\nallows for the negotiation of prescription\ndrug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients,\nwhich may result in reduced prescription\nprices. This could reduce some healthcare\ncompanies\u2019 overall profitability. Many new\nproducts in the healthcare sector may be\nsubject to regulatory approvals. The process\nof obtaining such approvals may be long and\ncostly, and such efforts ultimately may be\nunsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare\nsector may be thinly capitalized and may be\nsusceptible to product obsolescence. In\naddition, a number of legislative proposals\nconcerning healthcare have been considered by\nthe U.S. Congress in recent years. It is\nunclear what proposals will ultimately be\nenacted, if any, and what effect they may have\non companies in the healthcare sector.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. A Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, a Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nLiquid investments may become illiquid after\npurchase by a Fund, particularly during\nperiods of market turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or instrument that\nis deemed to be liquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long as it is\nheld by a Fund, and any security or instrument\nheld by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid\ninvestment pursuant to a Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent a Fund holds\nilliquid investments, the illiquid investments\nmay reduce the returns of a Fund because a\nFund may be unable to transact at advantageous\ntimes or prices. An investment may be illiquid\ndue to, among other things, the reduced number\nand capacity of traditional market\nparticipants to make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an active market for\nsuch securities or instruments, capital\ncontrols, delays or limits on repatriation of\nlocal currency, or insolvency of local\ngovernments. To the extent that a Fund invests\nin securities or instruments with substantial\nmarket and/or credit risk, a Fund will tend to\nhave increased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid investments. Illiquid\ninvestments may be harder to value, especially\nin changing markets. Although each Fund\nprimarily seeks to redeem shares of a Fund on\nan in-kind basis, if a Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to meet\nredemption requests or for other cash needs, a\nFund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified\nin a rising interest rate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions from a Fund\nmay be greater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as a Fund, causing\nincreased supply of a Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments in the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid\nsecurities to meet redemption requests and\nilliquid securities will become a larger\nportion of a Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by a Fund,\nwhich could lead to a Fund\u2019s shares trading at\na premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndustrials Sector Risk. The value of\nsecurities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply and demand changes related to their\nspecific products or services and industrials\nsector products in general. The products of\nmanufacturing companies may face obsolescence\ndue to rapid technological developments and\nfrequent new product introduction. Global\nevents, trade disputes and changes in\ngovernment regulations, economic conditions\nand exchange rates may adversely affect the\nperformance of companies in the industrials\nsector. Companies in the industrials sector\nmay be adversely affected by liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. The industrials sector may also be\nadversely affected by changes or trends in\ncommodity prices, which may be influenced by\nunpredictable factors. Companies in the\nindustrials sector, particularly aerospace and\ndefense companies, may also be adversely\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies in this sector tend to rely\nto a significant extent on government demand\nfor their products and services. Reliance on\nAdvisor Risk. The Fund is dependent upon\nservices and resources provided by BFA, and\ntherefore BFA\u2019s parent, BlackRock, Inc. BFA is\nnot required to devote its full time to the\nbusiness of the Fund and there is no guarantee\nor requirement that any investment\nprofessional or other employee of BFA will\nallocate a substantial portion of his or her\ntime to the Fund. The loss of, or changes in,\nBFA\u2019s personnel could have a negative effect\non the performance or the continued operation\nof the Fund. 17\n\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nTo the extent a Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A description\nof the Trust's policies and procedures with\nrespect to the disclosure of each Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities is available in the\nFunds' combined SAI. Each Fund discloses its\nportfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.\nFund fact sheets providing information\nregarding each Fund's top holdings are posted\non www.iShares.com when available and may be\nrequested by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737). Management Investment\nAdviser. As investment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Funds.\nBFA provides an investment program for each\nFund and manages the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. In managing the Funds, BFA may draw\nupon the research and expertise of its asset\nmanagement affiliates with respect to certain\nportfolio securities. In seeking to achieve a\nFund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of\nportfolio managers, investment strategists and\nother investment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. Pursuant\nto the Investment Advisory Agreement between\nBFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of\nthe Funds), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the Funds,\nexcept the management fees, interest expenses,\ntaxes, expenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Trustees who\nare not \u201c interested persons \u201d of the Trust).\nOperating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. For its\ninvestment advisory services to each Fund, BFA\nis paid a management fee from each Fund, as a\npercentage of each Fund\u2019s average daily net\nassets, at the annual rate set forth in the\ntable below. In addition, BFA may from time to\ntime voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees\nor expenses in order to limit total annual\nfund operating expenses (excluding Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement may be\neliminated by BFA at any time.\n                                              \n  Fund                       Management Fee1  \n  iShares Large Cap Max      0.50%            \n  Buffer Mar ETF                              \n  iShares Large Cap Max      0.50%            \n  Buffer Jun ETF                              \n  iShares Large Cap Max      0.50%            \n  Buffer Sep ETF                              \n  iShares Large Cap Max      0.50%            \n  Buffer Dec ETF                              \n                                              \n1 BFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees in an amount\nequal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to investments by the\nFunds in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2029 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is\nan indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of March\n31, 2024, BFA and its affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.5 trillion. BFA and its\naffiliates trade and invest for their own\naccounts in the actual securities and types of\nsecurities in which the Funds may also invest,\nwhich may affect the price of such securities.\nA discussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Board of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA is expected to be\navailable in each Fund's Form N-CSR filed with\nthe SEC for the period ending July 31, and\nmade available in the applicable financial\nstatements posted on the Fund's website at\nwww.iShares.com.\n\n18\n\nFrom time to time, a manager, analyst, or\nother employee of BlackRock or its affiliates\nmay express views regarding a particular asset\nclass, company, security, industry, or market\nsector. The views expressed by any such person\nare the views of only that individual as of\nthe time expressed and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of BlackRock or any other\nperson within the BlackRock organization. Any\nsuch views are subject to change at any time\nbased upon market or other conditions and\nBlackRock disclaims any responsibility to\nupdate such views. These views may not be\nrelied on as investment advice and may not be\nrelied on as an indication of trading intent\non behalf of a Fund. Portfolio Managers.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Funds. The Portfolio\nManagers are responsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management, including,\nbut not limited to, investing cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of their respective\nportfolio management team to focus on certain\nasset classes, implementing investment\nstrategy, researching and reviewing investment\nstrategy and overseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management teams who have\nmore limited responsibilities. Jennifer Hsui\nhas been employed by BFA or its affiliates as\na senior portfolio manager since 2007. Prior\nto that, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio manager from\n2006 to 2007 for Barclays Global Fund Advisors\n( \u201c BGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been a Portfolio\nManager of each Fund since inception (2024).\nGreg Savage has been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio manager since\n2006. Prior to that, Mr. Savage was a\nportfolio manager from 2001 to 2006 for BGFA.\nMr. Savage has been a Portfolio Manager of\neach Fund since inception (2024). Paul\nWhitehead has been with BlackRock since 1996,\nincluding his years with Barclays Global\nInvestors ( \u201c BGI \u201d ), which merged with\nBlackRock in 2009. Mr. Whitehead has been\nemployed by BlackRock as a Managing Director\nsince 2010 and a Director from 2009 to 2010.\nMr. Whitehead was employed by BGI as Principal\nfrom 2002 to 2009. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of each Fund since inception\n(2024). The Funds' SAI provides additional\ninformation about the Portfolio Managers'\ncompensation, other accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the Portfolio Managers'\nownership (if any) of shares in the Funds.\nAdministrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon ( \u201c BNY Mellon \u201d )\nis the administrator, custodian and transfer\nagent for the Fund. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nserves as custodian for the Funds in\nconnection with certain securities lending\nactivities. Conflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and its\naffiliates (including BlackRock and its\nsubsidiaries (collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective directors, officers\nor employees, in the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts and other\naccounts they manage, may present conflicts of\ninterest that could disadvantage the Funds and\ntheir shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates\nprovide investment management services to\nother funds and discretionary managed accounts\nthat may follow investment programs similar to\nthat of the Funds. BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and may engage in the ordinary\ncourse of business in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of their\nclients may conflict with those of the Funds.\nBFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act,\nas an investor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal, and have other direct and\nindirect interests in securities, currencies,\ncommodities, derivatives and other instruments\nin which the Funds may directly or indirectly\ninvests. The Funds may invest in securities\nof, or engage in other transactions with,\ncompanies with which an Affiliate has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Funds may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which an Affiliate provides and\nis compensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. The Funds also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other transactions\nwith, companies for which an Affiliate\nprovides or may in the future provide research\ncoverage. An Affiliate may have business\nrelationships with, and purchase or distribute\nor sell services or products from or to,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend the Funds or who engage in\ntransactions with or for the Funds, and may\nreceive compensation for such services. BFA or\none or more Affiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise accounts and\nfunds that have investment objectives similar\nto those of the Funds and/or that engage in\nand compete for transactions in the same types\nof securities, currencies and other\ninstruments as the Funds. This may include\ntransactions in securities issued by other\nopen-end and closed-end investment companies\n(which may include investment companies that\nare affiliated with the Funds and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d )).\nThe trading activities of BFA and these\nAffiliates are carried out without reference\nto positions held directly or indirectly by\nthe Funds and may result in BFA or an\nAffiliate having positions in certain\nsecurities that are senior or junior to, or\nhave interests different from or adverse to,\nthe securities that are owned by the Funds.\nNeither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under\nany obligation to share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy with the Funds.\nAs a result, an Affiliate may compete with the\nFunds for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of the Funds'\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate,\nand it is possible that the Funds could\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore Affiliates and other accounts achieve\nprofits on their trading for proprietary or\nother accounts. The opposite result is also\npossible. In addition, the Funds may, from\ntime to time, enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken\nby clients advised or managed by BFA or its\nAffiliates may adversely impact the Funds.\nTransactions by one or more clients or by BFA\nor its Affiliates or their directors, officers\nor employees may have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices\nor investment strategies of the Funds. 19 The\nFunds' activities may be limited because of\nregulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or their internal\npolicies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, each Fund has\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\nthe securities lending agent for the Fund to\nthe extent that the Fund participates in the\nsecurities lending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\nthe Fund may lend its portfolio securities\nunder the securities lending program. Under an\nETF Services Agreement, the Funds have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units of\nthe Funds ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard transaction\nfee received from Authorized Participants on\neach creation or redemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the ETF Services\nprovided. BlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank, on the design\nand development of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\naffiliates. It is also possible that, from\ntime to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients (including other funds and separately\nmanaged accounts) may, subject to compliance\nwith applicable law, purchase and hold shares\nof the Funds. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio\nof the Funds may be impacted by purchases and\nsales of the Funds by BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients. The activities of BFA and\nits Affiliates and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could disadvantage\nthe Funds and their shareholders. BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures designed to\naddress these potential conflicts of interest.\nSee the SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information Additional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy and sell\nshares of the Funds, is available free of\ncharge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and Selling Shares.\nShares of the Funds may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from a Fund only in Creation\nUnits or multiples thereof, as discussed in\nthe Creations and Redemptions section of this\nProspectus. Only an Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption transactions\ndirectly with a Fund. Once created, shares of\nthe Funds generally trade in the secondary\nmarket in amounts less than a Creation Unit.\nShares of each Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading during the\ntrading day. Shares can be bought and sold\nthroughout the trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies. The Trust\ndoes not impose any minimum investment for\nshares of a Fund purchased on an exchange or\notherwise in the secondary market. The Funds'\nshares trade under the ticker symbols listed\non the front cover page of this Prospectus.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market involves two types\nof costs that may apply to all securities\ntransactions. When buying or selling shares of\nthe Funds through a broker, you may incur a\nbrokerage commission and other charges. The\ncommission is frequently a fixed amount and\nmay be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell small amounts\nof shares. In addition, you may incur the cost\nof the \u201c spread, \u201d that is, any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for shares of each\nFund based on the Fund\u2019s trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if\nthe Fund has high trading volume and market\nliquidity, and higher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market liquidity (which is\noften the case for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The Fund's spread\nmay also be impacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity of the underlying securities held\nby the Fund, particularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances of\nsignificant volatility of the underlying\nsecurities. Each Fund does not impose\nrestrictions on the frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares directly with the\nFund. The Board determined not to adopt\npolicies and procedures designed to prevent or\nmonitor for frequent purchases and redemptions\nof Fund shares because each Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the close of the\nprimary markets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, each Fund has taken\ncertain measures ( e.g ., imposing transaction\nfees on purchases and redemptions of Creation\nUnits and reserving the right to reject\npurchases of Creation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the potential\nconsequences of frequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized Participants, such\nas increased tracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to the Fund,\nand/or increased transaction costs. Further,\nthe vast majority of trading in Fund shares\noccurs on the secondary market, which does not\ninvolve each Fund directly, and such trading\nis unlikely to cause many of the harmful\neffects of frequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The national\nsecurities exchange on which each Fund's\nshares are listed is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on weekends and\nthe following holidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Each Fund\u2019s primary listing exchange is\nCboe BZX. 20 Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and unregistered\ninvestment companies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For example, a\nregistered investment company (the \u201c Acquired\nFund \u201d ), such as the Fund, may not knowingly\nsell or otherwise dispose of any security\nissued by the Acquired Fund to any investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale\nor disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company\nor companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nAlthough SEC rules may permit registered\ninvestment companies and unit investment\ntrusts ( \u201c Investing Funds \u201d ) that enter into\nan investment agreement with the Trust to\ninvest in iShares funds beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\nsubject to certain terms and conditions, the\nFund does not permit such investments.\nAccordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to\nthe limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of\nthe 1940 Act when investing in the Fund. In\naddition, foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry. Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) or its nominee is the\nrecord owner of, and holds legal title to, all\noutstanding shares of each Fund. Investors\nowning shares of the Funds are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of DTC or its\nparticipants. DTC serves as the securities\ndepository for shares of the Funds. DTC\nparticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a custodial\nrelationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner\nof shares, you are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock certificates or to\nhave shares registered in your name, and you\nare not considered a registered owner of\nshares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an\nowner of shares, you must rely upon the\nprocedures of DTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those that apply to\nany other securities that you hold in book-\nentry or \u201c street name \u201d form. Share Prices.\nThe trading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares in the\nsecondary market generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected by market\nforces such as the supply of and demand for\nETF shares and shares of underlying securities\nheld by the Funds, economic conditions and\nother factors. Determination of Net Asset\nValue. The NAV of each Fund normally is\ndetermined once daily Monday through Friday,\ngenerally as of the close of regular trading\nhours of the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each\nday that the NYSE is open for trading, based\non prices at the time of closing, provided\nthat any Fund assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the\nprevailing market rates on the date of\nvaluation as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of each Fund is\ncalculated by dividing the value of the net\nassets of a Fund ( i.e. , the value of its\ntotal assets, which includes the values of the\nUnderlying Fund shares in which the Fund\ninvests, less total liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of the Fund,\ngenerally rounded to the nearest cent. The\nvalue of the securities and other assets and\nliabilities held by each Fund is determined\npursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been designated by the\nBoard as the valuation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act.\nEquity securities and other equity instruments\nfor which market quotations are readily\navailable are valued at market value, which is\ngenerally determined using the last reported\nofficial closing price or, if a reported\nclosing price is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or market on\nwhich the security or instrument is primarily\ntraded at the time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-traded closed-\nend funds or other ETFs are valued at their\nmost recent closing price. Generally, trading\nin non-U.S. securities and money market\ninstruments is substantially completed each\nday at various times prior to the close of\nregular trading hours of the NYSE. The values\nof such securities used in computing the NAV\nof the Funds are determined as of such times.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if a security or other asset or\nliability does not have a price source due to\nits lack of trading or other reasons, if a\nmarket quotation differs significantly from\nrecent price quotations or otherwise no longer\nappears to reflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is thinly\ntraded, when there is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation, or if the trading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended or closed and\nno appropriate alternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event \u201d is deemed\nto occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at the time of\npricing a Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities, that\nthe event is likely to cause a material change\nto the last exchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more assets held by, or\nliabilities of, a Fund. Fair value represents\na good faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of an asset\nor liability held by a Fund is the amount the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. Valuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing will result in prices\nthat may differ from current market valuations\nand that may not be the prices at which those\ninvestments could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used. 21 Dividends and Distributions.\nGeneral Policies. Dividends from net\ninvestment income, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a year by each\nFund. Each Fund generally distributes its net\ncapital gains, if any, to shareholders\nannually. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for each Fund. The Trust reserves the\nright to declare special distributions if, in\nits reasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a RIC or to avoid imposition of income or\nexcise taxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and other\ndistributions on shares of each Fund are\ndistributed on a pro rata basis to beneficial\nowners of such shares. Dividend payments are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from a Fund.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for\nuse by beneficial owners of a Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact their broker\nto determine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation\ntherein. Brokers may require beneficial owners\nto adhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If this service is available and\nused, dividend distributions of both income\nand realized gains will be automatically\nreinvested in additional whole shares of a\nFund purchased in the secondary market. Note\non Tax Information. The following sections\nsummarize some of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of an investment\nin the Fund. It is not a substitute for\npersonal tax advice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on Fund\ndistributions and sales of shares. Certain\nstates and localities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to interest from\nU.S. federal government obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about the potential\ntax consequences of an investment in shares of\nthe Fund under all applicable tax laws. Taxes.\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of the Funds\nwill be taxed. The tax information in this\nProspectus is provided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should consult your\nown tax professional about the tax\nconsequences of an investment in shares of the\nFunds. Unless your investment in Fund shares\nis made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-\ndeferred retirement account, such as an IRA,\nin which case your distributions generally\nwill be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be\naware of the possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or you sell Fund\nshares. Taxes on Distributions. Distributions\nfrom a Fund\u2019s net investment income (other\nthan qualified dividend income), including\ndistributions of income from securities\nlending and distributions out of a Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gains, if any, are taxable\nto you as ordinary income. Distributions by a\nFund of net long-term capital gains, if any,\nin excess of net short-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as\nlong-term capital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held a Fund\u2019s shares.\nDistributions by a Fund that qualify as\nqualified dividend income are taxable to you\nat long-term capital gain rates. Long-term\ncapital gains and qualified dividend income\nare generally eligible for taxation at a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts. In\naddition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on \u201c net\ninvestment income, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends, and net gain,\nof U.S. individuals with income exceeding\n$200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and trusts. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income to you if\nthey are attributable to qualified dividend\nincome received by a Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income includes dividend\nincome from taxable U.S. corporations and\nqualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that\na Fund satisfies certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the stock of such\ncorporations and has not hedged its position\nin the stock in certain ways. Substitute\ndividends received by a Fund with respect to\ndividends paid on securities lent out will not\nbe qualified dividend income. For this\npurpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation\nmeans any non-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the U.S., which\nincludes an exchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to which the\ndividend was paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities market. The term\nexcludes a corporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company. Dividends received\nby a Fund from a RIC generally are qualified\ndividend income only to the extent such\ndividend distributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. The Funds do not expect that a\nsignificant portion of their distributions\nwill consist of qualified dividend income or\nbe eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT and\ndistributed to a shareholder generally will be\ntaxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.\nHowever, for tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026,\nthe Fund may report dividends eligible for a\n20% \u201c qualified business income \u201d deduction\nfor non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the\nextent the Fund\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable\nFund expenses. For a dividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the dividend must\nbe received with respect to a share of stock\nheld without being hedged by a Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of a Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date which is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. In\ngeneral, your distributions are subject to\nU.S. federal income tax for the year when they\nare paid. Certain distributions paid in\nJanuary, however, may be treated as paid on\nDecember 31 of the prior year. 22 Short term\ncapital gains earned by an Underlying Fund\nwill be ordinary income when distributed to\nthe Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's\ncapital losses. Because each Fund is expected\nto invest in its respective Underlying Funds,\neach Fund\u2019s realized losses on sales of shares\nof an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or\npermanently deferred as \u201c wash sales \u201d .\nCapital loss carryforwards of an Underlying\nFund, if any, would not offset net capital\ngains of the Fund. If a Fund\u2019s distributions\nexceed current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in excess of a\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of a Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthose shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. Once a shareholder's cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as capital gain,\nif the shareholder holds shares of a Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends, interest and\ncapital gains earned by an Underlying Fund\nwith respect to securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to withholding and other\ntaxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If\nmore than 50% of the total assets of an\nUnderlying Fund at the close of a year\nconsists of non-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ) (and\n50% of the total assets of a Fund at the close\nof the year consists of foreign securities,\nor, at the close of each quarter, shares of\nUnderlying Funds), a Fund may \u201c pass through \u201d\nto you certain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. For purposes of foreign\ntax credits for U.S. shareholders of each\nFund, foreign capital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source income,\nthereby limiting a U.S. person\u2019s ability to\nuse such credits. If you are neither a\nresident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. corporation (other than a pass-\nthrough entity to the extent owned by U.S.\npersons), a Fund\u2019s ordinary income dividends\n(which include distributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be subject to a\n30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies, provided that withholding\ntax will generally not apply to any gain or\nincome realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in\nrespect of any distributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or other\ndisposition of shares of a Fund. Separately, a\n30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account holders\nand (ii) certain other foreign entities,\nunless they certify certain information\nregarding their direct and indirect U.S.\nowners. To avoid withholding, foreign\nfinancial institutions will need to (i) enter\ninto agreements with the IRS that state that\nthey will provide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses and taxpayer\nidentification numbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders, comply with due\ndiligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts, report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information,\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event that an applicable intergovernmental\nagreement and implementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue authorities\nwith similar account holder information. Other\nforeign entities may need to report the name,\naddress, and taxpayer identification number of\neach substantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership unless certain exceptions apply. If\nyour Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending arrangement, you may lose\nthe ability to treat Fund dividends paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower as\nqualified dividend income. In addition, you\nmay lose the ability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund if your\nFund shares are loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the U.S., by law,\nbackup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to\nyour distributions and proceeds if you have\nnot provided a taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and made other\nrequired certifications. Taxes When Shares Are\nSold. Currently, any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term gain or loss\nif the shares have been held for more than one\nyear. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a\nsale of Fund shares held for one year or less\nis generally treated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital loss on the sale\nof shares held for six months or less is\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of Fund shares or\nfrom capital gain dividends, are included in \u201c\nnet investment income \u201d for purposes of the\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax\nmentioned above. Treatment of the FLEX\nOptions. A Fund\u2019s investments in offsetting\npositions with respect to the Underlying ETF\nmay be \u201c straddles \u201d for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. The straddle rules may affect\nthe character of gains (or losses) realized by\na Fund, and losses realized by a Fund on\npositions that are part of a straddle may be\ndeferred under the straddle rules, rather than\nbeing taken into account in calculating\ntaxable income for the taxable year in which\nthe losses are realized. In addition, certain\ncarrying charges (including interest expense)\nassociated with positions in a straddle may be\nrequired to be capitalized rather than\ndeducted currently. Certain elections that a\nFund may make with respect to its straddle\npositions may also affect the amount,\ncharacter and timing of the recognition of\ngains or losses from the affected positions.\nThe tax consequences of straddle transactions\nto a Fund are not entirely clear in all\nsituations under currently available\nauthority. The straddle rules may increase the\namount of short-term capital gain realized by\na Fund, which is taxed as ordinary income when\ndistributed to U.S. shareholders in a non-\nliquidating distribution. Because application\nof the straddle rules may affect the character\nof gains or losses, defer losses and/or\naccelerate the recognition of gains or losses\nfrom the affected straddle positions, if a\nFund makes a non-liquidating 23 distribution\nof its short-term capital gain, the amount\nwhich U.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be increased or decreased\nsubstantially as compared to a Fund that did\nnot engage in such transactions. The FLEX\nOptions included in the portfolio are\nexchange-traded options. Under Section 1256 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, certain types of\nexchange-traded options are treated as if they\nwere sold (i.e., \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at the\nend of each year. The Funds do not believe\nthat the positions held by the Funds will be\nsubject to Section 1256, which means that the\npositions will not be marked to market, but\nthe positions will be subject to the straddle\nrules. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current U.S.\nfederal tax law of an investment in a Fund. It\nis not a substitute for personal tax advice.\nYou may also be subject to state and local\ntaxation on Fund distributions and sales of\nshares. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund under all\napplicable tax laws. Creations and\nRedemptions. Prior to trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Funds are \u201c created \u201d at\nNAV by market makers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block size Creation Units\nor multiples thereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d ) has entered into an agreement\nwith the Funds\u2019 Distributor. An Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with each Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units. A\ncreation transaction, which is subject to\nacceptance by the Distributor and a Fund,\ngenerally takes place when an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into the Fund a\ndesignated portfolio of securities, assets or\nother positions (a \u201c creation basket \u201d ), and\nan amount of cash (including any cash\nrepresenting the value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other positions), if\nany, which together approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a specified number\nof Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units, generally for\na designated portfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c redemption basket \u201d )\nheld by the Fund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted). Each Fund\ngenerally offers Creation Units partially for\ncash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units solely for cash or solely in-\nkind. Except when aggregated in Creation\nUnits, shares are not redeemable by a Fund.\nCreation and redemption baskets may differ and\na Fund will accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation regarding custom baskets is\ncontained in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The prices at\nwhich creations and redemptions occur are\nbased on the next calculation of NAV after a\ncreation or redemption order is received in an\nacceptable form under the authorized\nparticipant agreement. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with a Fund. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of a Fund. In the event\nof a system failure or other interruption,\nincluding disruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants, orders to purchase or\nredeem Creation Units either may not be\nexecuted according to a Fund\u2019s instructions or\nmay not be executed at all, or the Fund may\nnot be able to place or change orders. To the\nextent a Fund engages in in-kind transactions,\nthe Fund intends to comply with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and satisfying\nredemptions with redemption securities by,\namong other means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit and any\nsecurities used to satisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions that would be\nexempt from registration under the 1933 Act.\nFurther, an Authorized Participant that is not\na \u201c qualified institutional buyer, \u201d as such\nterm is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933\nAct, will not be able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. Creations and redemptions must be made\nthrough a firm that is either a member of the\nContinuous Net Settlement System of the\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation or a\nDTC participant that has executed an agreement\nwith the Distributor with respect to creations\nand redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.\nInformation about the procedures regarding\ncreation and redemption of Creation Units\n(including the cut-off times for receipt of\ncreation and redemption orders) is included in\nthe Funds\u2019 SAI. Because new shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses\nto exchange members, the prospectus delivery\nmechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\na national securities exchange. Householding.\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. 24 Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for each Fund on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of any\nFund or the securities that are purchased or\nsold by any Fund. The Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. BFA or its affiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks or other intermediaries\n(together, \u201c intermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds and certain\nother iShares funds available to their\ncustomers generally and in certain investment\nprograms. Such payments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary, are not made\nby the Funds. Rather, such payments are made\nby BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the iShares funds\ncomplex. Payments of this type are sometimes\nreferred to as revenue-sharing payments. A\nfinancial intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it recommends\nor makes available, or the level of services\nprovided, to its customers based on the\npayments or other financial incentives it is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives offered or made\nto an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds or other iShares funds\nover another investment. More information\nregarding these payments is contained in the\nFunds' SAI. Please contact your salesperson or\nother investment professional for more\ninformation regarding any such payments his or\nher firm may receive from BFA or its\naffiliates. Financial Highlights Financial\nhighlights for the Funds are not available\nbecause, as of the effective date of this\nProspectus, the Funds have not commenced\noperations and therefore have no financial\nhighlights to report. 25 [THIS PAGE\nINTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] [THIS PAGE\nINTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] [THIS PAGE\nINTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\nWant to know more? iShares.com |\n1-800-474-2737 (1-800-iShares) Information on\nthe Funds' net asset value, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads\ncan be found at www.iShares.com .

345\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates to the following Funds: \u2022 iShares\nLarge Cap Max Buffer Mar ETF \u2022 iShares Large\nCap Max Buffer Jun ETF \u2022 iShares Large Cap Max\nBuffer Sep ETF \u2022 iShares Large Cap Max Buffer\nDec ETF The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Mar\nETF seeks to track the share price return of\nthe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (the \u201c Underlying\nETF \u201d or \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d ) up to an\napproximate upside limit, while seeking to\nmaximize the downside protection against price\ndeclines of the Underlying Fund over an\napproximate 12-month period beginning at the\nend of each March. The iShares Large Cap Max\nBuffer Jun ETF seeks to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying Fund up to an\napproximate upside limit, while seeking to\nmaximize the downside protection against price\ndeclines of the Underlying Fund over an\napproximate 12-month period beginning at the\nend of each June. The iShares Large Cap Max\nBuffer Sep ETF seeks to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying Fund up to an\napproximate upside limit, while seeking to\nmaximize the downside protection against price\ndeclines of the Underlying Fund over an\napproximate 12-month period beginning at the\nend of each September. The iShares Large Cap\nMax Buffer Dec ETF seeks to track the share\nprice return of the Underlying Fund up to an\napproximate upside limit, while seeking to\nmaximize the downside protection against price\ndeclines of the Underlying Fund over an\napproximate 12-month period beginning at the\nend of each December. BlackRock Fund Advisors\n( \u201c BFA \u201d ) serves as investment adviser to\nthe Funds, and BFA or its affiliates serves as\ninvestment adviser to the Underlying Fund.\nEach Fund offers and issues shares at its net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\n(the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d or \u201c Creation\nBasket \u201d ), together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment (the \u201c Cash Component \u201d\n). Shares of each Fund are listed for trading\non the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c Cboe BZX \u201d\n), a national securities exchange. Shares of\neach Fund are traded in the secondary market\nand elsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units, and,\ngenerally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally 40,000\nor multiples thereof. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities.\n\n1\n\nExchange Listing and Trading A discussion of\nexchange listing and trading matters\nassociated with an investment in each Fund is\ncontained in the Shareholder Information\nsection of each Fund's Prospectus. The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, that section of the\nProspectus. Shares of each Fund are listed for\ntrading, and trade throughout the day, on the\nListing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Funds may also be\nlisted on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There\ncan be no assurance that the requirements of\nthe Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the\nlisting of shares of any Fund will continue to\nbe met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not\nrequired to, remove the shares of a Fund from\nlisting if, among other things: (i) following\nthe initial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iv) any event\nshall occur or condition shall exist that, in\nthe opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of a Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of a Fund through\na broker, you may incur a brokerage commission\ndetermined by that broker, as well as other\ncharges. The Trust reserves the right to\nadjust the share price of the Funds in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Funds or an investor's\nequity interest in the Funds. Investment\nStrategies and Risks of the Funds iShares\nLarge Cap Max Buffer Mar ETF The Fund seeks to\nprovide exposure to the share price return of\nthe Underlying ETF up to an approximate upside\nlimit (the \u201c Approximate Cap \u201d ), while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst Underlying ETF losses (the \u201c\nApproximate Buffer \u201d ) over each annual Hedge\nPeriod (as defined below). Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of\nits net assets (plus any borrowings for\ninvestment purposes) in securities or other\ninstruments that provide exposure to\nsecurities of large capitalization companies\nor that provide for the upside limit on gains\nor the downside protection against the losses\nof securities of large capitalization\ncompanies. For purposes of the Fund\u2019s 80%\npolicy, \u201c large capitalization companies \u201d are\nthose within the range of capitalization of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s underlying index. The\nFund principally buys shares of the Underlying\nETF and customized put options thereon and\nsells call options that reference the\nUnderlying ETF. The options in which the Fund\ntransacts (typically, equity or index\nexchange-traded options contracts) are\nreferred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Index (the \u201c Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe large-capitalization sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities in\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are weighted based\non the float-adjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares. The Underlying ETF\u2019s Index\nconsists of securities from a broad range of\nindustries. The components of the Underlying\nETF\u2019s Index are likely to change over time.\nBFA is the investment adviser to the\nUnderlying ETF and receives a management fee\nfrom the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is\nmanaged using a representative sampling\nindexing strategy. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to\n\n2\n\nthat of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nUnderlying ETF may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on an exchange,\nincluding the Chicago Board Options Exchange (\n\u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are marked to\nmarket daily by the Fund. The value of the\nFLEX Options in which the Fund invests is\naffected by changes in the value and dividend\nrates of the securities held by the Underlying\nETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market. The\nFund will typically trade options that expire\nat or around the end of each annual period or\n\u201c Hedge Period \u201d (April 1 through March 31),\nsubject to the annual rebalancing process\ndescribed below. The Fund will be indefinitely\noffered and is not intended to terminate after\none or more Hedge Periods. For each Hedge\nPeriod, the Fund obtains exposure to the share\nprice return of the Underlying ETF by\npurchasing shares of the Underlying ETF and\nfutures that reference the price performance\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, and creates the\nApproximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by\ntrading a combination of put and call\nexchange-traded options. Specifically, the\nFund typically creates the Approximate Buffer\nby buying a put option with the strike price\napproximately at-the-money relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price. The Fund\nsimultaneously writes a call option with a\nhigher strike price relative to the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price to collect a premium that it\nuses to offset the premium paid to buy the put\noption. The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s market value\nand NAV may not correlate with the Underlying\nETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, especially\nduring each Hedge Period. The strike prices\nfor the capped calls will change for each\nHedge Period depending on the prevailing\nmarket conditions and the cost of the put\noption for that Hedge Period, resulting in a\ndifferent Approximate Cap for each Hedge\nPeriod. The Fund will typically buy Underlying\nETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex and seek to enter into the combination\nof options transactions described above if\nthere are any inflows, or creation\ntransactions, during a Hedge Period. This will\noccur even in circumstances where the Fund\nwould receive a negligible premium for writing\nan out-of-the-money call which may potentially\ngive up more sizable returns to the extent\nthat the option later becomes in the money.\nBecause the Fund will effectively use\ndistributions from the Underlying ETF to\npurchase the downside protection, the Fund\u2019s\nperformance\n\n3\n\nis likely to be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of April 1 through March\n31, the Approximate Cap is [__]% prior to\ntaking into account any fees or expenses\ncharged to or transaction costs incurred by\nthe Fund or Underlying ETF. When the Fund\u2019s\nannualized management fee of 0.50% of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets is taken into\naccount, the Approximate Cap for the current\nHedge Period is reduced to [__]%. The returns\nthat the Fund seeks to provide also do not\ninclude the costs associated with purchasing\nshares of the Fund. The Approximate Buffer\nthat the Fund typically seeks to provide is\nagainst approximately 100% of Underlying ETF\nlosses for the applicable Hedge Period;\nhowever, there is no guarantee that the\nApproximate Buffer will succeed in providing\nthe intended protection. The Approximate\nBuffer is provided prior to taking into\naccount any fees or expenses charged to the\nFund. These fees and any expenses will reduce\nthe Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund\u2019s\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com . The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\n\n4\n\niShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF The Fund\nseeks to provide exposure to the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF up to an\napproximate upside limit (the \u201c Approximate\nCap \u201d ), while seeking to maximize the\ndownside protection against Underlying ETF\nlosses (the \u201c Approximate Buffer \u201d ) over each\nannual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund invests at\nleast 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. For purposes of the\nFund\u2019s 80% policy, \u201c large capitalization\ncompanies \u201d are those within the range of\ncapitalization of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index. The Fund principally buys\nshares of the Underlying ETF and customized\nput options thereon and sells call options\nthat reference the Underlying ETF. The options\nin which the Fund transacts (typically, equity\nor index exchange-traded options contracts)\nare referred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, which measures the\nperformance of the large-capitalization sector\nof the U.S. equity market, as determined by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nweighted based on the float-adjusted market\nvalue of their outstanding shares. The\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index consists of securities\nfrom a broad range of industries. The\ncomponents of the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Underlying ETF and\nreceives a management fee from the Underlying\nETF. The Underlying ETF is managed using a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nUnderlying ETF may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex.

FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for every\nseller and the seller for every buyer \u201d . The\nOCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options for\ncertain significant events. The FLEX Options\nin which the Fund invests are European style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the\n\n5\n\nexpiration date. The FLEX Options traded by\nthe Fund are listed on an exchange, including\nthe Chicago Board Options Exchange ( \u201c CBOE \u201d\n). Options positions are marked to market\ndaily by the Fund. The value of the FLEX\nOptions in which the Fund invests is affected\nby changes in the value and dividend rates of\nthe securities held by the Underlying ETF,\nchanges in interest rates, changes in the\nactual or perceived volatility of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and the remaining time\nto such options\u2019 expiration, as well as\ntrading conditions in the options market.

The call subjects the Fund to the\nApproximate Cap as it limits the Fund\u2019s\nability to realize any increase in the value\nof the Underlying ETF above the strike price.\nThe Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is\nbased on the strike price of the capped call\nfor that Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s market value\nand NAV may not correlate with the Underlying\nETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, especially\nduring each Hedge Period. The strike prices\nfor the capped calls will change for each\nHedge Period depending on the prevailing\nmarket conditions and the cost of the put\noption for that Hedge Period, resulting in a\ndifferent Approximate Cap for each Hedge\nPeriod. The Fund will typically buy Underlying\nETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex and seek to enter into the combination\nof options transactions described above if\nthere are any inflows, or creation\ntransactions, during a Hedge Period. This will\noccur even in circumstances where the Fund\nwould receive a negligible premium for writing\nan out-of-the-money call which may potentially\ngive up more sizable returns to the extent\nthat the option later becomes in the money.\nBecause the\n\n8\n\nFund will effectively use distributions from\nthe Underlying ETF to purchase the downside\nprotection, the Fund\u2019s performance is likely\nto be less than the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance when (1) distributions are\nconsidered and (2) the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance is positive. In order to obtain\neconomic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in\nlieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and\nfutures on the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index for a\nHedge Period, the Fund may instead, among\nother things: purchase call options with a\nstrike price that is very low (approximately\n1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nshare price on the day of purchase (a \u201c zero\nstrike call \u201d ); purchase one or more other\nETFs that seek to track the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex; purchase equity securities (e.g.,\ncomponent securities of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex) in seeking to track the share price\nreturn of the Underlying ETF; or invest in\nU.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or\nother cash equivalents and purchase or sell a\ncombination of call and put options that seek\nto synthesize the economic characteristics of\nthe Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in\nequity securities (other than the Underlying\nETF), the Fund\u2019s equity security investments\nwill be primarily in common stocks of\ncompanies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA\nbelieves will provide a risk/ return profile\nsimilar to that of the Underlying ETF. For the\ncurrent Hedge Period of October 1 through\nSeptember 30, the Approximate Cap is 107.91%\nprior to taking into account any fees or\nexpenses charged to or transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF. When\nthe Fund\u2019s annualized management fee of 0.50%\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets is\ntaken into account, the Approximate Cap for\nthe current Hedge Period is reduced to\n107.41%. The returns that the Fund seeks to\nprovide also do not include the costs\nassociated with purchasing shares of the Fund.\nThe Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically\nseeks to provide is against approximately 100%\nof Underlying ETF losses for the applicable\nHedge Period; however, there is no guarantee\nthat the Approximate Buffer will succeed in\nproviding the intended protection. The\nApproximate Buffer is provided prior to taking\ninto account any fees or expenses charged to\nthe Fund. These fees and any expenses will\nreduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund\nshareholders for a Hedge Period. When the\nFund\u2019s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of\nthe Fund\u2019s daily net assets is taken into\naccount for a Hedge Period, the net\nApproximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is\n99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge\nPeriod and will maximize the Approximate\nBuffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate\nBuffer, including below 100%, to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2%. For example,\nif interest rates are low enough that\nproviding against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses would result in an\nApproximate Cap of less than 2%, the Fund\nwould decrease the protection such that the\nApproximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on\nthe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer\nwill be provided shortly before each Hedge\nPeriod. The Approximate Buffer and Approximate\nCap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund\nshares held over the entire Hedge Period. An\ninvestor that purchases Fund shares after the\nbeginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund\nshares before the end of a Hedge Period, may\nnot fully realize the Approximate Buffer or\nApproximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may\nbe exposed to greater risk of loss and less\npotential gain. This is because while the\nApproximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the\nHedge Period are fixed levels that are\ncalculated in relation to the Underlying ETF\nprice and the Fund\u2019s NAV at the start of each\nHedge Period and generally remain constant\nthroughout the Hedge Period, an investor\npurchasing Fund shares at market price during\nthe Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares\nat a price that is different from the Fund\u2019s\nNAV at the start of the Hedge Period ( i.e. ,\nthe NAV that the Approximate Cap and\nApproximate Buffer reference). For example, if\nan investor purchases Fund shares during a\nHedge Period at a time when the Underlying\nETF\u2019s share price has increased from its price\nat the beginning of the Hedge Period, the\ninvestor\u2019s upside limit may be lower than the\nApproximate Cap and the investor may\nexperience losses prior to reaching the\ndownside protection offered by the Approximate\nBuffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases\nFund shares during a Hedge Period at a time\nwhen the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price has\ndecreased from its price at the beginning of\nthe Hedge Period, the Fund may require a\nlarger increase in the Underlying ETF\u2019s share\nprice before it reaches the Approximate Cap.\nThe Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer,\nand the Fund\u2019s position relative to each,\nwhich are typically available on iShares.com\ndaily, should be considered before investing\nin the Fund. In periods of extreme market\nvolatility, the Fund\u2019s return may be subject\nto an upside limit significantly below the\nApproximate Cap and downside protection\nsignificantly lower than the Approximate\nBuffer. An investor may lose their entire\ninvestment and an investment in the Fund is\nonly appropriate for investors willing to bear\nthose losses. Following the close of business\non the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund\nwill file a prospectus supplement that\ndiscloses the Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap (gross\nand net of the unitary management fee) for the\nnext Hedge Period. The Fund\u2019s Approximate Cap\n(net of the unitary management fee) for the\ncurrent Hedge Period, along with Fund\u2019s\nposition relative to the Approximate Buffer\nand Approximate Cap, will be available on the\nFund\u2019s website, www.iShares.com .\n\n9\n\nThe Fund is classified as non-diversified\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). iShares Large Cap\nMax Buffer Dec ETF The Fund seeks to provide\nexposure to the share price return of the\nUnderlying ETF up to an approximate upside\nlimit (the \u201c Approximate Cap \u201d ), while\nseeking to maximize the downside protection\nagainst Underlying ETF losses (the \u201c\nApproximate Buffer \u201d ) over each annual Hedge\nPeriod (as defined below). Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of\nits net assets (plus any borrowings for\ninvestment purposes) in securities or other\ninstruments that provide exposure to\nsecurities of large capitalization companies\nor that provide for the upside limit on gains\nor the downside protection against the losses\nof securities of large capitalization\ncompanies. For purposes of the Fund\u2019s 80%\npolicy, \u201c large capitalization companies \u201d are\nthose within the range of capitalization of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s underlying index. The\nFund principally buys shares of the Underlying\nETF and customized put options thereon and\nsells call options that reference the\nUnderlying ETF. The options in which the Fund\ntransacts (typically, equity or index\nexchange-traded options contracts) are\nreferred to generally as Flexible Exchange\nOptions ( \u201c FLEX Options \u201d ). The Fund may\ntransact in other listed options that\nreference the price performance of the\nUnderlying ETF, the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nunderlying index, or other exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) that track the Underlying\nETF\u2019s underlying index (collectively, \u201c\nexchange-traded options \u201d ). The Fund intends\nto maximize protection against loss through\nthe Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2%\nminimum Approximate Cap as further described\nbelow. While the Fund typically seeks to\nprovide against approximately 100% of\nUnderlying ETF losses for each applicable\nHedge Period, the Fund will reduce the\nApproximate Buffer below 100% to provide an\nApproximate Cap of at least 2% during each\nHedge Period. The Underlying ETF is an ETF\nthat seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Underlying ETF\u2019s Index, which measures the\nperformance of the large-capitalization sector\nof the U.S. equity market, as determined by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nweighted based on the float-adjusted market\nvalue of their outstanding shares. The\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index consists of securities\nfrom a broad range of industries. The\ncomponents of the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Underlying ETF and\nreceives a management fee from the Underlying\nETF. The Underlying ETF is managed using a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nUnderlying ETF may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index.\nRepresentative sampling may subject the\nUnderlying ETF to \u201c tracking error \u201d , which\nis the divergence of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex. This risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. The prospectus and\nother reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker:\nIVV) are available on the Securities and\nExchange Commission\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .\nShares of the Underlying ETF are listed on\nNYSE Arca, Inc. An options contract is an\nagreement between a buyer and seller that\ngives the purchaser of the option the right\nbut not the obligation to buy (in the case of\na call option) or sell (in the case of a put\noption) a particular financial instrument at a\nspecified future date for an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201c strike price \u201d ). If\nthe Fund purchases a call option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund purchases a put option, the Fund\npays a premium and receives the right, but not\nthe obligation, to sell shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on the expiration date.\nWhen the Fund writes (sells) a call option,\nthe Fund receives a premium and gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to purchase\nfrom the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or\nother reference asset at a strike price by or\non the expiration date. If the Fund writes\n(sells) a put option, the Fund receives a\npremium and gives the purchaser of the option\nthe right to sell to the Fund shares of the\nUnderlying ETF or other reference asset at a\nstrike price by or on expiration date. FLEX\nOptions provide investors with the ability to\ncustomize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty risk exposure of\nover-the-counter derivatives. Like traditional\nexchange-traded options, FLEX Options are\nguaranteed for settlement by the Options\nClearing Corporation (the \u201c OCC \u201d ), a market\nclearinghouse that guarantees performance by\ncounterparties to certain derivatives\ncontracts by becoming the \u201c buyer for\n\n10\n\nevery seller and the seller for every buyer \u201d\n. The OCC may make adjustments to FLEX Options\nfor certain significant events. The FLEX\nOptions in which the Fund invests are European\nstyle, which are exercisable at the strike\nprice only on the expiration date. The FLEX\nOptions traded by the Fund are listed on an\nexchange, including the Chicago Board Options\nExchange ( \u201c CBOE \u201d ). Options positions are\nmarked to market daily by the Fund. The value\nof the FLEX Options in which the Fund invests\nis affected by changes in the value and\ndividend rates of the securities held by the\nUnderlying ETF, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived volatility\nof the Underlying ETF\u2019s Index and the\nremaining time to such options\u2019 expiration, as\nwell as trading conditions in the options\nmarket. The Fund will typically trade options\nthat expire at or around the end of each\nannual period or \u201c Hedge Period \u201d (January 1\nthrough December 31), subject to the annual\nrebalancing process described below. The Fund\nwill be indefinitely offered and is not\nintended to terminate after one or more Hedge\nPeriods. For each Hedge Period, the Fund\nobtains exposure to the share price return of\nthe Underlying ETF by purchasing shares of the\nUnderlying ETF and futures that reference the\nprice performance of the Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex, and creates the Approximate Buffer and\nApproximate Cap by trading a combination of\nput and call exchange-traded options.\nSpecifically, the Fund typically creates the\nApproximate Buffer by buying a put option with\nthe strike price approximately at-the-money\nrelative to the Underlying ETF\u2019s share price.\nThe Fund simultaneously writes a call option\nwith a higher strike price relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price to collect a\npremium that it uses to offset the premium\npaid to buy the put option. The call subjects\nthe Fund to the Approximate Cap as it limits\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to realize any increase in\nthe value of the Underlying ETF above the\nstrike price. The Approximate Cap for each\nHedge Period is based on the strike price of\nthe capped call for that Hedge Period. The\nFund\u2019s market value and NAV may not correlate\nwith the Underlying ETF and Underlying ETF\u2019s\nIndex, especially during each Hedge Period.\nThe strike prices for the capped calls will\nchange for each Hedge Period depending on the\nprevailing market conditions and the cost of\nthe put option for that Hedge Period,\nresulting in a different Approximate Cap for\neach Hedge Period. The Fund will typically buy\nUnderlying ETF shares and futures on the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index and seek to enter into\nthe combination of options transactions\ndescribed above if there are any inflows, or\ncreation transactions, during a Hedge Period.\nThis will occur even in circumstances where\nthe Fund would receive a negligible premium\nfor writing an out-of-the-money call which may\npotentially give up more sizable returns to\nthe extent that the option later becomes in\nthe money. Because the Fund will effectively\nuse distributions from the Underlying ETF to\npurchase the downside protection, the Fund\u2019s\nperformance is likely to be less than the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance when (1)\ndistributions are considered and (2) the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s performance is positive. In\norder to obtain economic exposure to the\nUnderlying ETF, in lieu of purchasing\nUnderlying ETF shares and futures on the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index for a Hedge Period, the\nFund may instead, among other things: purchase\ncall options with a strike price that is very\nlow (approximately 1% or less) relative to the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s share price on the day of\npurchase (a \u201c zero strike call \u201d ); purchase\none or more other ETFs that seek to track the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index; purchase equity\nsecurities (e.g., component securities of the\nUnderlying ETF\u2019s Index) in seeking to track\nthe share price return of the Underlying ETF;\nor invest in U.S. treasuries, money market\nfunds and/or other cash equivalents and\npurchase or sell a combination of call and put\noptions that seek to synthesize the economic\ncharacteristics of the Underlying ETF. If the\nFund invests in equity securities (other than\nthe Underlying ETF), the Fund\u2019s equity\nsecurity investments will be primarily in\ncommon stocks of companies held by the\nUnderlying ETF that BFA believes will provide\na risk/ return profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying ETF. For the current Hedge Period\nof January 1 through December 31, the\nApproximate Cap is [__]% prior to taking into\naccount any fees or expenses charged to or\ntransaction costs incurred by the Fund or\nUnderlying ETF. When the Fund\u2019s annualized\nmanagement fee of 0.50% of the Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets is taken into account, the\nApproximate Cap for the current Hedge Period\nis reduced to [__]%.

The Fund is\nclassified as non-diversified under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). Additional Information\nRegarding FLEX Options. FLEX Options are\ncustomized option contracts available through\nnational securities exchanges that are\nguaranteed for settlement by the OCC. FLEX\nOptions are listed on a U.S. national\nsecurities exchange. FLEX Options provide\ninvestors with the ability to customize assets\nreferenced by the options, exercise prices,\nexercise styles (i.e., American- style,\nexercisable any time prior to the expiration\ndate, or European-style, exercisable only on\nthe option expiration date) and expiration\ndates, while achieving price discovery in\ncompetitive, transparent auctions markets and\navoiding the counterparty exposure of over-\nthe-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) options positions.\nEach option contract entitles the holder\nthereof to purchase (for the call options) or\nsell (for the put options) shares of the\nreference asset at the strike price. Each\nFund\u2019s portfolio includes several types of\nFLEX Options, including both purchased and\nwritten put and call options (as further\ndescribed below). The FLEX Options are all\nEuropean style options, which means that they\nare exercisable at a predetermined specified\nprice (the \u201c strike price \u201d ) only on the FLEX\nOption\u2019s expiration date. The OCC guarantees\nperformance by each of the counterparties to\nthe FLEX Options, becoming the \u201c buyer for\nevery seller and the seller for every buyer \u201d\n, reducing counterparty risk for clearing\nmembers and options traders. Although\nguaranteed for settlement by the OCC, FLEX\nOptions are still subject to counterparty risk\nwith the OCC and subject to the risk that the\nOCC may fail to perform the settlement of the\nFLEX Options due to bankruptcy or other\nadverse reasons. Each Fund bears the risk that\nthe OCC will be unable or unwilling to perform\nits obligations under the FLEX Options\ncontracts. Subject to determination by the\nSecurities Committee of the OCC, adjustments\nmay be made to the FLEX Options for certain\nevents (collectively, \u201c Corporate Actions \u201d )\nspecified in the OCC\u2019s by-laws and rules:\ncertain stock dividends or distributions,\nstock splits, reverse stock splits, rights\nofferings, distributions, reorganizations,\nrecapitalizations, or reclassifications with\nrespect to an underlying security, or a\nmerger, consolidation, dissolution or\nliquidation of the issuer of the underlying\nsecurity. According to the OCC\u2019s by-laws, the\nnature and extent of any such adjustment is to\nbe determined by the OCC\u2019s Securities\nCommittee, in light of the circumstances known\nto it at the time such determination is made,\nbased on its judgment as to what is\nappropriate for the protection of investors\nand the public interest, taking into account\nsuch factors as fairness to holders and\nwriters (or purchasers and sellers) of the\naffected options, the maintenance of a fair\nand orderly market in the\n\n12\n\naffected options, consistency of\ninterpretation and practice, efficiency of\nexercise settlement procedures, and the\ncoordination with other clearing agencies of\nthe clearance and settlement of transactions\nin the underlying interest. Certain\nConsiderations Regarding Options . The FLEX\nOptions in which each Fund invests will be\noptions on an ETF or the S&P 500 Index\n(together with such ETF, a \u201c Reference Asset \u201d\n) or the S&P 500 Index. As such, the value of\na Fund\u2019s FLEX Options will fluctuate with\nchanges in the value of the securities held by\nthe ETF, and thus the ETF\u2019s share price. In\naddition to the value of the ETF, the value of\nan option, in general, will reflect, among\nother things, the time remaining until\nexpiration (the end of the Outcome Period),\nthe relationship of the exercise price to the\nmarket price of the Reference Asset, and\ngeneral market conditions. Options that expire\nunexercised have no value. Each of the options\nexchanges has established limitations\ngoverning the maximum number of call or put\noptions on the same asset that may be bought\nor written by a single investor, whether\nacting alone or in concert with others\n(regardless of whether such options are\nwritten on the same or different exchanges or\nare held or written on one or more accounts or\nthrough one or more brokers). Under these\nlimitations, option positions of all\ninvestment companies advised by BFA are\ncombined for purposes of these limits.\nPursuant to these limitations, an exchange may\norder the liquidation of positions and may\nimpose other sanctions or restrictions. These\nposition limits may restrict the number of\nlisted options that a Fund may buy or sell.\nCurrently, the relevant national securities\nexchanges have no position limits for the\ninstruments in which the Funds expect to\ninvest. The puts and calls on the Reference\nAsset entitle the purchaser of the option the\nright to purchase (for a call option) or sell\n(for a put option) the Reference Asset at a\npredetermined specified price (the \u201c strike\nprice \u201d ). When a Fund writes a call on the\nReference Asset, it receives a premium and\nagrees that the purchaser of the call, upon\nexercise of the call, will receive from the\nFund the delivery of a specified number of\nshares of the ETF in exchange for the strike\nprice. When a Fund buys a call on the\nReference Asset, it pays a premium and has the\nsame rights to such call as indicated above.\nWhen a Fund buys a put on the Reference Asset,\nit pays a premium and has the right to require\nthe seller of the put, upon the Fund\u2019s\nexercise of the put, to deliver the specified\nnumber of shares of the ETF in exchange for\nthe strike price. When a Fund writes a put on\nthe Reference Asset, it receives a premium and\nthe purchaser of the put has the right to\nrequire the Fund to deliver the specified\nnumber of shares of the ETF in exchange for\nthe strike price. Although each Fund will\ngenerally utilize FLEX Options that are\nphysically settled, a Fund may also utilize\nFLEX Options that are cash-settled. Cash-\nsettled options give the holder the right to\nreceive an amount (or owe an amount) of cash\nupon the exercise of the option. Gain or loss\ndepends on changes in the value of the ETF\u2019s\nshare price relative to the strike price for a\ngiven option contract. The amount of cash is\nequal to the difference between the closing\nprice of the ETF\u2019s share price and the\nexercise price of the option contract times a\nspecified multiple ( \u201c multiplier \u201d ), which\ndetermines the total value for each point of\nsuch difference. Risks of Options on the\nReference Assets. If a Fund has purchased an\noption and exercises it before the closing\nvalue for that day is available, it runs the\nrisk that the level of the Reference Asset may\nsubsequently change. If such a change causes\nthe exercised option to fall out of the money,\nthe applicable Fund will be required to pay\nthe difference between the closing Reference\nAsset value and the exercise price of the\noption (times the applicable multiplier) to\nthe assigned writer. Borrowing. Each Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The\nincurrence of leverage increases a Fund\u2019s\nexposure to risk, and borrowed funds are\nsubject to interest costs that will reduce net\nincome. Purchasing securities while borrowings\nare outstanding creates special risks, such as\nthe potential for greater volatility in the\nNAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a\nFund\u2019s portfolio. In addition, the interest\nexpenses from borrowings may exceed the income\ngenerated by a Fund\u2019s portfolio and,\ntherefore, the amount available (if any) for\ndistribution to shareholders as dividends may\nbe reduced. BFA may determine to maintain\noutstanding borrowings if it expects that the\nbenefits to a Fund\u2019s shareholders will\noutweigh the current reduced return. Certain\ntypes of borrowings by a Fund must be made\nfrom a bank or may result in a Fund being\nsubject to covenants in credit agreements\nrelating to asset coverage, portfolio\ncomposition requirements and other matters. It\nis not anticipated that observance of such\ncovenants would impede BFA\u2019s management of a\nFund\u2019s portfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may\n\n13\n\nresult in acceleration of outstanding\nindebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of\nportfolio investments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Diversification\nStatus. Each Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d A \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund is a\nfund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with\nregard to the percentage of its assets that\nmay be invested in the securities of a single\nissuer. The securities of a particular issuer\n(or securities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of a fund\u2019s investment portfolio.\nThis may adversely affect a fund\u2019s performance\nor subject the fund\u2019s shares to greater price\nvolatility than that experienced by more\ndiversified investment companies. Each Fund\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Equity Securities. Equity\nsecurities generally have greater price\nvolatility than fixed-income securities. The\nmarket price of equity securities may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nEquity securities may decline in value due to\nfactors affecting equity securities markets\ngenerally; particular industries, sectors or\ngeographic regions represented in those\nmarkets; or individual issuers. The types of\ndevelopments that may affect an issuer of an\nequity security include management\nperformance, financial leverage and reduced\ndemand for the issuer's goods or services.\nCommon and preferred stock represent equity or\nownership interests in an issuer. Preferred\nstock, however, pays dividends at a specified\nrate and has precedence over common stock in\nthe payment of dividends. In the event an\nissuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,\nthe claims of owners of bonds and preferred\nstock take precedence over the claims of those\nwho own common stock. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by a Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund to access its investable\nuniverse, simulate investments that would\notherwise be eligible, facilitate trading or\nto reduce transaction costs. Each Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund or the Underlying Fund will not use\nfutures, options on futures or securities\noptions for speculative purposes. Each Fund\nand the Underlying Fund intend to use futures\nand options on futures in accordance with Rule\n4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to the Underlying Fund, has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d in\naccordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with\nrespect to such Funds or the Underlying Fund,\nis not subject to registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA.\nSee the Regulation Regarding Derivatives\nsection of this SAI for more information.\nFutures contracts provide for the future sale\nby one party and purchase by another party of\na specified amount of a specific instrument or\nindex at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Stock index contracts are\nbased on investments that reflect the market\nvalue of common stock of the firms included in\nthe investments. Each Fund or the Underlying\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund will be required to\ndeposit with the broker an amount of cash or\ncash equivalents known as \u201c initial margin, \u201d\nwhich is similar to a performance bond or good\nfaith deposit on the contract and is returned\nto the Fund or the Underlying Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund or the Underlying Fund may\nelect to close the position by taking an\nopposite position, which will operate to\nterminate the Fund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's\nexisting position in the contract. An option\non a futures contract, as contrasted with a\ndirect investment in such a contract, gives\nthe purchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract.\n\n14\n\nThe potential for loss related to the purchase\nof an option on a futures contract is limited\nto the premium paid for the option plus\ntransaction costs. Because the value of the\noption is fixed at the point of sale, there\nare no daily cash payments by the purchaser to\nreflect changes in the value of the underlying\ncontract; however, the value of the option\nchanges daily and that change would be\nreflected in the NAV of each Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund. The potential for loss\nrelated to writing call options is unlimited.\nThe potential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Funds or the Underlying Fund may\npurchase and write put and call options on\nfutures contracts that are traded on an\nexchange as a hedge against changes in value\nof their portfolio securities or in\nanticipation of the purchase of securities,\nand may enter into closing transactions with\nrespect to such options to terminate existing\npositions. There is no guarantee that such\nclosing transactions can be effected.\nSecurities options may be used by a Fund to\nobtain access to or dispose of securities that\nare otherwise eligible investments at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that being sought by the Fund or otherwise\nto achieve the Fund's objective. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives a holder the right\nto sell a specific security at an exercise\nprice within a specified period of time. The\ninitial purchaser of a call option pays the \u201c\nwriter \u201d a premium, which is paid at the time\nof purchase and is retained by the writer\nwhether or not such option is exercised. Each\nFund or the Underlying Fund may purchase put\noptions to hedge its portfolio against the\nrisk of a decline in the market value of\nsecurities held and may purchase call options\nto hedge against an increase in the price of\nsecurities it is committed to purchase. Each\nFund or the Underlying Fund may write put and\ncall options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund or the Underlying Fund may\npurchase or sell securities options on a U.S.\nor non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC\nmarket through a transaction with a dealer.\nOptions on a securities index are typically\nsettled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). Investments in Underlying Funds.\nEach Underlying Fund is a type of investment\ncompany referred to as an exchange-traded fund\n( \u201c ETF \u201d ). Each Underlying Fund is designed\nto track a particular index and is advised by\nBFA. Shares of the Underlying Funds are listed\nfor trading on national securities exchanges\nand trade throughout the day on those\nexchanges and other secondary markets. There\ncan be no assurance that the requirements of\nthe national securities exchanges necessary to\nmaintain the listing of shares of the\nUnderlying Funds will continue to be met. A\nnational securities exchange may, but is not\nrequired to, remove the shares of the\nUnderlying Funds from listing if, among other\nthings: (i) following the initial 12-month\nperiod beginning upon the commencement of\ntrading of an Underlying Fund, there are fewer\nthan 50 record and/or beneficial holders of\nthe shares for 30 or more consecutive trading\ndays, (ii) the value of an Underlying Fund's\nunderlying index is no longer calculated or\navailable, or (iii) any other event shall\noccur or condition exist that, in the opinion\nof the national securities exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the national securities\nexchange inadvisable. A national securities\nexchange will remove the shares of an\nUnderlying Fund from listing and trading upon\ntermination of such Underlying Fund. Shares of\neach Underlying Fund trade on exchanges at\nprices at, above or below their most recent\nNAV. The per share NAV of each Underlying Fund\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of such Underlying Fund's holdings since\nthe most recent calculation. The trading\nprices of an Underlying Fund's shares\nfluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan NAV. The trading prices of an Underlying\nFund's shares may deviate significantly from\nNAV during periods of market volatility. Any\nof these factors may lead to an Underlying\nFund's shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with an Underlying Fund's\nNAV due to timing reasons as well as market\nsupply and demand factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to an Underlying Fund's creations\nand redemptions or the existence of extreme\nmarket volatility may result in trading prices\nof Underlying Fund shares that differ\nsignificantly from NAV. If the Funds purchase\nshares of the Underlying Funds at a time when\nthe market price of the Underlying Fund's\nshares are at a premium to the NAV or sells at\na time when the market price of the Underlying\nFund is at a discount to the NAV, then the\nFunds may sustain losses. As in the case of\nother publicly-traded securities, brokers'\ncommissions on buying or selling shares of the\nUnderlying Funds will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels. An\ninvestment in an ETF generally presents the\nsame primary risks as an investment in an\nopen-end investment company that is not\nexchange-traded and that has the same\ninvestment objectives, strategies, and\npolicies. However, ETFs are subject to the\nfollowing risks that do not apply to an open-\nend investment company that is not exchange-\ntraded: (i) the market price of the ETF's\nshares may trade at a discount to their net\nasset value; (ii) an active trading market for\nan ETF's shares may not develop or be\nmaintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's\n\n15\n\nshares may be halted if the listing exchange's\nofficials deem such action appropriate, the\nshares are delisted from the exchange, or the\nactivation of market-wide \u201c circuit breakers \u201d\n(which are tied to large swings in stock\nprices) halts stock trading generally. Lending\nPortfolio Securities. Each Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may lend portfolio securities\nto certain borrowers that BFA determines to be\ncreditworthy, including borrowers affiliated\nwith BFA. The borrowers provide collateral\nthat is maintained in an amount at least equal\nto the current market value of the securities\nloaned. No securities loan shall be made on\nbehalf of a Fund or Underlying Fund if, as a\nresult, the aggregate value of all securities\nloans of the particular Fund or Underlying\nFund exceeds one-third of the value of such\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's total assets\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). A Fund or Underlying Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the\nreturn of the securities loaned. Each Fund or\nUnderlying Fund receives, by way of substitute\npayment, the value of any interest or cash or\nnon-cash distributions paid on the loaned\nsecurities that it would have otherwise\nreceived if the securities were not on loan.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower may be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Funds are compensated by any\npositive difference between the amount earned\non the reinvestment of cash collateral and the\nfee paid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, a Fund or\nUnderlying Fund is compensated by a fee paid\nby the borrower equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral received by the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund for such loans, and uninvested\ncash, may be reinvested in certain short-term\ninstruments either directly on behalf of each\nFund or Underlying Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nOther investment companies in which a Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund invests can be expected to\nincur fees and expenses for operations, such\nas investment advisory and administration\nfees, that would be in addition to those\nincurred by a Fund or the Underlying Fund.\nEach Fund and Underlying Fund conducts its\nsecurities lending pursuant to an exemptive\norder from the SEC permitting it to lend\nportfolio securities to borrowers affiliated\nwith the Fund or Underlying Fund and to retain\nan affiliate of the Fund or Underlying Fund to\nact as securities lending agent. To the extent\nthat a Fund or Underlying Fund engages in\nsecurities lending, BlackRock Institutional\nTrust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund, subject to the overall\nsupervision of BFA. BTC administers the\nlending program in accordance with guidelines\napproved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of which are the \u201c\nTrustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c\nJPMorgan \u201d ) serves as custodian for the Funds\nin connection with certain securities lending\nactivities. Securities lending involves\nexposure to certain risks, including\noperational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and\naccounting process), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a mismatch between the return on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund\nor Underlying Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a shortfall at default when a cash\ncollateral investment is denominated in a\ncurrency other than the currency of the assets\nbeing loaned due to movements in foreign\nexchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund or Underlying Fund to lend securities\nthat are trading at a premium due to increased\ndemand, or to recall loaned securities or to\nlend less or not at all, which could lead to\nreduced securities lending revenue). If a Fund\nwere to lend out securities that are subject\nto a corporate action and commit to the\nborrower a particular election as determined\nby the Funds' investment adviser, the benefit\nthe Fund would receive in respect of\ncommitting to such election may or may not be\nless than the benefit the Fund would have\nreceived from making a different election in\nsuch corporate action. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, a Fund or\nUnderlying Fund would be subject to the risk\nof a possible delay in receiving collateral or\nin recovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In\nthe event a borrower does not return a Fund\u2019s\nor Underlying Fund's securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's ability to\nparticipate in a corporate action event may be\nimpacted, or the Fund or Underlying Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund or Underlying Fund. A Fund or Underlying\nFund could lose money if its short-term\ninvestment of the collateral declines in value\nover the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund or Underlying Fund\nrepresenting dividends paid on securities\nloaned out by the Fund or Underlying Fund will\nnot be considered qualified dividend income.\nBTC will take into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with a Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\n\n16\n\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund or Underlying Fund (as\npermitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund or Underlying\nFund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose\nupon collateral, exercise other default rights\nor restrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's ability to terminate existing\nsecurities lending agreements or to realize\namounts to be received under such agreements.\nLiquidity Risk Management. Rule 22e-4 under\nthe Investment Company Act (the \u201c Liquidity\nRule \u201d ) requires open-end funds, including\nETFs such as the Funds, to establish a\nliquidity risk management program (the \u201c\nLiquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance disclosures\nregarding fund liquidity. As required by the\nLiquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a\nLiquidity Program, and the Board, including a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees of the\nTrust, has appointed BFA as the administrator\nof the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews each Fund\u2019s liquidity\nrisk and classifies each investment held by a\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that a Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by a Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The liquidity\nof a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. NDFs and cash-settled\ncurrency forwards as well as futures, options\non futures, currency options and swaps entered\ninto by the Fund will be treated as CFTC\nDerivatives for these purposes. Physically-\nsettled foreign currency forward contracts\nwill generally be treated as CFTC Derivatives,\nhowever these contracts are not treated as\nCFTC regulated-swaps and are not subject to\ncertain of the CFTC\u2019s rules with respect to\nswaps. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC\nDerivatives, it intends to do so below such\nprescribed levels and intends not to market\nitself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a vehicle\nfor trading such instruments. BFA has claimed\nan exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\npursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to the Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in the Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits the Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Fund,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which the Fund\nis or may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other\n\n17\n\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse\ntender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if\nthe Fund elects to treat these transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4; and\n(4) when-issued or forward-settling securities\n(e.g., firm and standby commitments, including\nto-be-announced ( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and\ndollar rolls) and non-standard settlement\ncycle securities, unless the Fund intends to\nphysically settle the transaction and the\ntransaction will settle within 35 days of its\ntrade date (the \u201c Delayed-Settlement\nSecurities Provision \u201d ). Unless the Fund is\nrelying on the Limited Derivatives User\nException (as defined below), the Fund must\ncomply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to its\nDerivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among\nother things, requires the Fund to adopt and\nimplement a comprehensive written derivatives\nrisk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d ) and\ncomply with a relative or absolute limit on\nFund leverage risk calculated based on value-\nat-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is administered\nby a \u201c derivatives risk manager, \u201d who is\nappointed by the Board, including a majority\nof Independent Directors/Trustees, and\nperiodically reviews the DRMP and reports to\nthe Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Securities of\nInvestment Companies. Each Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in the securities\nof other investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law,\nregulation, exemptive order or SEC staff\nguidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund\u2019s\ninvestment in investment companies is limited\nto, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting stock of any one\ninvestment company, (ii) 5% of the fund\u2019s\ntotal assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which the Fund or the Underlying\nFund invests can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund\nor the Underlying Fund. Pursuant to guidance\nissued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of\nmoney market funds used for cash collateral\nreceived in connection with loans of\nsecurities are not treated as Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund's pro\nrata share of the fees and expenses incurred\nby investing in other investment companies (as\ndisclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).\nEach Fund or the Underlying Fund may purchase\nETF shares for the same reason it would\npurchase (and as an alternative to purchasing)\nfutures contracts \u2013 to obtain relatively low-\ncost exposure to the stock market while\nmaintaining flexibility to meet the liquidity\nneeds of the Underlying Fund. ETF shares enjoy\nseveral advantages over futures contracts.\nDepending on the market, the holding period,\nand other factors, ETF shares can be less\ncostly than futures contracts. In addition,\nETF shares can be purchased for smaller sums\nand offer exposure to market sectors and\nstyles for which there is no suitable or\nliquid futures contract. The Underlying Fund\nmay also purchase ETF shares for other\npurposes, including improving its ability to\ntrack its underlying index. The Underlying\nFund may invest in shares of ETFs that are\nadvised by BFA. Short-Term Instruments and\nTemporary Investments. Each Fund and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019\nacceptances, fixed-time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global\nRatings, or if unrated, of comparable quality\nas determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of\nthese instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. See Risks of the Underlying Fund\nbelow.\n\n18\n\nTracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe board of each Fund or the Underlying Fund\nmay, in the future, authorize each Fund and\nthe Underlying Fund to invest in securities\ncontracts and investments, other than those\nlisted in this SAI and in the Prospectus,\nprovided they are consistent with each Fund's\nor the Underlying Fund's investment objective\nand do not violate any of its investment\nrestrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. Because each Fund expects to\nobtain its exposure to the securities\nsubstantially through its investment in the\nUnderlying Fund, shareholders should be aware\nthat the risks of investment in particular\ntypes of securities, economic sectors and\ngeographic locations discussed below may be\nborne by the Fund through its investment in\nthe Underlying Fund. Through its investment in\nthe Underlying Fund, each Fund will also bear\nthe risks described below associated with the\nUnderlying Fund's use of portfolio management\ntechniques, such as borrowing arrangements and\nuse of derivatives, in addition to the risks\nassociated with those activities if the Funds\nengage in them directly. An investment in a\nFund should be made with an understanding that\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities,\nincluding its investment in the Underlying\nFund, may fluctuate in accordance with changes\nin the financial condition of the issuers of\nthe portfolio securities, the value of stocks\nin general, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. Each Fund may not acquire\nany illiquid investment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would have invested\nmore than 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments.\n\n19\n\nMoney Market Instruments Risk. A Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's other service providers may\nexperience disruptions or operating errors\nsuch as processing errors or human errors,\ninadequate or failed internal or external\nprocesses, or systems or technology failures,\nthat could negatively impact the Funds or\nUnderlying Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's in\nthe setting of priorities, the personnel and\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring\nand oversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund or Underlying Fund service\nproviders to identify all of the operational\nrisks that may affect a Fund or Underlying\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund or Underlying Fund\nmay be exposed to financial instruments that\nrecently transitioned from, or continue to be\ntied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c\nLIBOR \u201d ) to determine payment obligations,\nfinancing terms, hedging strategies or\ninvestment value. The United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which\nregulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all\nLIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the\nFCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings\nwill continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may have instruments linked to\nother interbank offered rates that may also\ncease to be published in the future. Risk of\nDerivatives. A derivative is a financial\ncontract, the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying\nasset, such as a security, a commodity (such\nas gold or silver), a currency or an index (a\nmeasure of value or rates, such as the S&P 500\nor the prime lending rate). The Funds and the\nUnderlying Fund may invest in stock index\nfutures contracts, securities options and\nother derivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus a Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's losses may be greater if it\ninvests in derivatives than if it invests only\nin conventional securities. Derivatives are\nalso subject to counterparty risk, which is\nthe risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage. When a derivative is\nused as a hedge against a position that a Fund\nholds or is committed to purchase, any loss\ngenerated by the derivative generally should\nbe substantially offset by gains on the hedged\ninvestment, and vice versa. While hedging can\nreduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce\nor eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand the Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective.\n\n20\n\nRisks of Equity Securities. An investment in a\nFund should be made with an understanding that\nthe value of the Underlying Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof preferred or common stocks in general and\nother factors that affect the market. An\ninvestment in a Fund should also be made with\nan understanding of the risks inherent in an\ninvestment in equity securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of the stock market may deteriorate\n(either of which may cause a decrease in the\nvalue of the portfolio securities and thus in\nthe value of shares of the Underlying Fund).\nCommon stocks are susceptible to general stock\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Holders of common stocks incur more\nrisk than holders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders\ngenerally have rights to receive payments from\nthe issuer inferior to the rights of creditors\nor holders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however, is\nsubject to market fluctuations prior to\nmaturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Risk of Futures and Options on\nFutures Transactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While each Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in a Fund's\nunderlying instrument. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, a Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if a Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Tracking Error\nRisk. The Underlying Fund may be subject to\ntracking error, which is the divergence of a\nfund\u2019s performance from that of its underlying\nindex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in a fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index, pricing differences,\ntransaction costs incurred by the Underlying\nFund, Underlying Fund\u2019s holding of uninvested\ncash, differences in timing of the accrual of\nor the valuation of dividends or interest\nreceived by the Underlying Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to maintain\npass-through tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to minimize\n\n21\n\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Fund\u2019s underlying\nindex or the costs to the Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result because a fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while such a fund\u2019s\nunderlying index does not. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by the Underlying Fund, BFA may\nconduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the re-\nbalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s portfolio and, if it\ndoes so, such a fund will be subject to\nincreased tracking error due to the divergence\nin the securities included in its portfolio\nfrom its underlying index. BFA\u2019s under-\nweighting or excluding such securities may\nresult in a decline in a Fund\u2019s net asset\nvalue. The application of the above-mentioned\nanalysis and screening to the Underlying Fund\nand its underlying index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nsuch a Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more\nsuch securities declines in value. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\n\n22\n\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nstaples sector may also be affected by changes\nin global economic, environmental and\npolitical events, economic conditions, the\ndepletion of resources, and government\nregulation. For instance, government\nregulations may affect the permissibility of\nusing various food additives and production\nmethods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability. In\naddition, tobacco companies may be adversely\naffected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector also may be\nsubject to risks pertaining to the supply of,\ndemand for and prices of raw materials. The\nprices of raw materials fluctuate in response\nto a number of factors, including, without\nlimitation, changes in government agricultural\nsupport programs, exchange rates, import and\nexport controls, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in an Underlying\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, an\nUnderlying Fund could lose all or a\nsubstantial portion of its investment. The\nenergy sector is cyclical and is highly\ndependent on commodity prices. Prices and\nsupplies of energy may fluctuate significantly\nover short and long periods of time due to,\namong other things, national and international\npolitical changes, Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d ) policies,\nchanges in relationships among OPEC members\nand between OPEC and oil-importing nations,\nthe regulatory environment, taxation policies,\nthe enactment or cessation of trade sanctions,\nwar or other geopolitical conflicts, and the\neconomies of key energy-consuming countries.\nCompanies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by terrorism, cyber\nincidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of the Underlying Fund.\n\n23\n\nRisk of Investing in the Financials Sector.\nCompanies in the financials sector include\nsmall, regional and money center banks,\nsecurities brokerage firms, asset management\ncompanies, savings banks and thrift\ninstitutions, specialty finance companies (\ne.g. , credit card, mortgage providers),\ninsurance and insurance brokerage firms,\nconsumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which the Underlying Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding market share and price competition.\nFinancial companies in foreign countries are\nsubject to market-specific and general\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers. In\naddition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to\n\n24\n\nlose market share and/or reduce the price\ncharged for the product, resulting in lower\nprofits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace\nand defense companies, a component of the\nindustrials sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on government\ndemand for their products and services. Thus,\nthe financial condition of, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace and defense companies\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense\nspending policies, which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control government\nbudgets. Transportation stocks, a component of\nthe industrials sector, are cyclical and can\nbe significantly affected by economic changes,\nfuel prices, labor relations and insurance\ncosts. Transportation companies in certain\ncountries may also be subject to significant\ngovernment regulation and oversight, which may\nadversely affect their businesses. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which a Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate\n\n25\n\nindustry is highly sensitive to general and\nlocal economic conditions and developments,\nand characterized by intense competition and\nperiodic overbuilding. Investing in Real\nEstate Companies involves various risks. Some\nrisks that are specific to Real Estate\nCompanies are discussed in greater detail\nbelow. Concentration Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype. Economic downturns affecting a\nparticular region, industry or property type\nmay lead to a high volume of defaults within a\nshort period. Distressed Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may invest in distressed,\ndefaulted or out-of-favor bank loans.\nIdentification and implementation by a Real\nEstate Company of loan modification and\nrestructure programs involves a high degree of\nuncertainty. Even successful implementation\nmay still require adverse compromises and may\nnot prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies\nmay also invest in other debt instruments that\nmay become non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other\n\n26\n\ncommercial restrictions or environmental\nregulations, also may have a major impact on\nreal estate income and values. In addition,\nquarterly compliance with regulations limiting\nthe proportion of asset types held by a U.S.\nREIT may force certain Real Estate Companies\nto liquidate or restructure otherwise\nattractive investments. Some countries may not\nrecognize REITs or comparable structures as a\nviable form of real estate funds. Underlying\nInvestment Risk. Real Estate Companies make\ninvestments in a variety of debt and equity\ninstruments with varying risk profiles. For\ninstance, Real Estate Companies may invest in\ndebt instruments secured by commercial\nproperty that have higher risks of delinquency\nand foreclosure than loans on single family\nhomes due to a variety of factors associated\nwith commercial property, including the tie\nbetween income available to service debt and\nproductive use of the property. Real Estate\nCompanies may also invest in debt instruments\nand preferred equity that are junior in an\nissuer\u2019s capital structure and that involve\nprivately negotiated structures. Subordinated\ndebt investments, such as B-Notes and\nmezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk\nof default due to the need to service more\nsenior debt of the issuer. Similarly,\npreferred equity investments involve a greater\nrisk of loss than conventional debt financing\ndue to their non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in CMBS may\nalso be junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, an Underlying Fund may at times need to\nrequest permission to extend the deadline for\nissuing your tax reporting statement or\nsupplement the information otherwise provided\nto you. Risk of Investing in Technology\nCompanies. Technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technological advances\nmay have limited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources and personnel. These\ncompanies may face rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and costs related\nto new product introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Risk of Investing in\nthe Telecommunications Sector. The\ntelecommunications sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation. The costs of complying\nwith governmental regulations, delays or\nfailure to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively affect the\nbusiness of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the Utilities\nSector. The utilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changing commodity prices,\ngovernment regulation stipulating rates\ncharged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation\n\n27\n\nand maintenance of nuclear facilities.\nGovernment regulators monitor and control\nutility revenues and costs, and therefore may\nlimit utility profits. In certain countries,\nregulatory authorities may also restrict a\ncompany\u2019s access to new markets, thereby\ndiminishing the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\nThere are substantial differences among the\nregulatory practices and policies of various\njurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may\nmake major shifts in policy from time to time.\nThere is no assurance that regulatory\nauthorities will, in the future, grant rate\nincreases. Additionally, existing and possible\nfuture regulatory legislation may make it even\nmore difficult for utilities to obtain\nadequate relief. Certain of the issuers of\nsecurities held in the Underlying Funds'\nportfolio may own or operate nuclear\ngenerating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: A Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness\n\n28\n\nday, a list of a Fund\u2019s holdings (generally\npro-rata) that Authorized Participants could\ndeliver to a Fund to settle purchases of a\nFund ( i.e. Deposit Securities) or that\nAuthorized Participants would receive from a\nFund to settle redemptions of a Fund ( i.e.\nFund Securities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling a Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nInvestment Policies The Board has adopted as\nfundamental policies the following numbered\ninvestment policies, which cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the applicable Fund\u2019s outstanding\nvoting securities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of a Fund is\ndefined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i)\n67% or more of the voting securities present\nat a shareholder meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund.\nEach Fund has also adopted certain non-\nfundamental investment policies, including its\ninvestment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\neach Fund may change its investment objective\nwithout shareholder approval. Fundamental\nInvestment Policies of the Funds.\n\n29\n\nThe Funds may not: 1. Purchase the securities\nof issuers conducting their principal business\nactivity in the same industry if, immediately\nafter the purchase and as a result thereof,\nthe value of a Fund\u2019s investments in that\nindustry would equal or exceed 25% of the\ncurrent value of a Fund\u2019s total assets,\nprovided that this restriction does not limit\na Fund\u2019s: (i) investments in securities of\nother investment companies, (ii) investments\nin securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities,\nor (iii) investments in repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities.\n2. Borrow money, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except each Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof real estate investment trusts, mortgage-\nrelated securities and securities of issuers\nengaged in the real estate business, and each\nFund may purchase and hold real estate as a\nresult of the ownership of securities or other\ninstruments. 5. Underwrite securities issued\nby others, except to the extent that the sale\nof portfolio securities by each Fund may be\ndeemed to be an underwriting or as otherwise\npermitted by applicable law. 6. Purchase or\nsell commodities or commodity contracts,\nexcept as permitted by the Investment Company\nAct. 7. Make loans to the extent prohibited by\nthe Investment Company Act. Notations\nRegarding each Fund\u2019s Fundamental Investment\nPolicies The following notations are not\nconsidered to be part of each Fund\u2019s\nfundamental investment policies and are\nsubject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of industries\nconstitutes concentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities; securities of\nstate, territory, possession or municipal\ngovernments and their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\neach Fund\u2019s industry classifications, each\nFund currently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits each Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (Each Fund\u2019s total assets include\nthe amounts being borrowed.) To limit the\nrisks attendant to borrowing, the Investment\nCompany Act requires each Fund to maintain at\nall times an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least\n300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of\neach Fund\u2019s total assets (including amounts\nborrowed), minus liabilities other than\nborrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of\nall borrowings. Borrowing money to increase\nportfolio holdings is known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d\nCertain trading practices and investments,\nsuch as reverse repurchase agreements, may be\nconsidered to be borrowings or involve\nleverage and thus are subject to the\nInvestment Company Act restrictions. In\naccordance with Rule 18f- 4 under the\nInvestment Company Act, when each Fund engages\nin reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions, the Fund may either\n(i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy.\n\n30\n\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to underwriting set forth in (5)\nabove, the Investment Company Act does not\nprohibit a fund from engaging in the\nunderwriting business or from underwriting the\nsecurities of other issuers; in fact, in the\ncase of diversified funds, the Investment\nCompany Act permits a fund to have\nunderwriting commitments of up to 25% of its\nassets under certain circumstances. Those\ncircumstances currently are that the amount of\na fund\u2019s underwriting commitments, when added\nto the value of a fund\u2019s investments in\nissuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of those\nissuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities may be considered to be an\nunderwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is\nnot believed that the application of the 1933\nAct provisions described above would cause a\nfund to be engaged in the business of\nunderwriting, the policy in (5) above will be\ninterpreted not to prevent a fund from\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities, regardless of whether a fund may\nbe considered to be an underwriter under the\n1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the\nunderwriting business to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit each Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFunds. Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, each Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). The\nforegoing restriction does not restrict the\nFund from acquiring the shares of registered\nopen-end investment companies to the extent\notherwise permissible under other provisions\nof the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 2.\nUnder normal market conditions, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets (plus any\nborrowings for investment purposes) in\nsecurities or other instruments that provide\nexposure to securities of large capitalization\ncompanies or that provide for the upside limit\non gains or the downside protection against\nthe losses of securities of large\ncapitalization companies. A Fund will notify\nits shareholders at least 60 days prior to any\nchange in its restrictions described in 2\nabove. Notations Regarding each Fund\u2019s\nFundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment\nPolicies Unless otherwise indicated, all\nlimitations under a Fund\u2019s fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment restrictions apply only\nat the time that a transaction is undertaken.\nAny change in the percentage of a Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in a Fund\u2019s total assets will\nnot require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment. Continuous Offering The method by\nwhich Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand\n\n31\n\nfor shares. A determination of whether one is\nan underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act\nmust take into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nshares, generally are required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\n1933 Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of\nthe 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus\ndelivery obligation with respect to shares of\nthe Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule\n153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the prospectus\nis available at the Listing Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is available only with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Funds, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers. Each Trustee serves\nuntil he or she resigns, is removed, dies,\nretires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer\nshall hold office until his or her successor\nis elected and qualifies or until his or her\ndeath, resignation or removal.

Board \u2013\nLeadership Structure and Oversight\nResponsibilities Overall responsibility for\noversight of the Funds rests with the Board.\nThe Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds\non a day-to-day basis. The Board is\nresponsible for overseeing BFA and other\nservice providers in the operations of the\nFunds in accordance with the provisions of the\n1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and\nother laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The Board\nis currently composed of eleven members, nine\nof whom are Independent Trustees. The Board\ncurrently conducts regular in person meetings\nfour times a year. In addition, the Board\nfrequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the\n\n39\n\noversight functions delegated to the Committee\nby the Board and reports its finding to the\nBoard. The Board and each standing Committee\nconduct annual assessments of their oversight\nfunction and structure. The Board has\ndetermined that the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure is appropriate because it allows the\nBoard to exercise independent judgment over\nmanagement and it allocates areas of\nresponsibility among committees of Independent\nTrustees and the full Board to enhance\neffective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Funds' investment performance\nor other activities.

Ownership information is not\nprovided for the Funds, as they have not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI. Conflicts of Interest. Certain activities\nof BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same\n\n45\n\nsecurities, currencies, and instruments in\nwhich a Fund invests. Such activities could\naffect the prices and availability of the\nsecurities, currencies, and instruments in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could have an\nadverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such\ntransactions, particularly in respect of most\nproprietary accounts or client accounts, will\nbe executed independently of a Fund's\ntransactions and thus at prices or rates that\nmay be more or less favorable than those\nobtained by the Fund. When BlackRock seeks to\npurchase or sell the same assets for managed\naccounts, including a Fund, the assets\nactually purchased or sold may be allocated\namong the accounts on a basis determined in\nits good faith discretion to be equitable. In\nsome cases, this system may adversely affect\nthe size or price of the assets purchased or\nsold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when a\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached.\n\n46\n\nFor example, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Funds or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund. At\ntimes, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of a\nFund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arm\u2019s-length basis. To the extent\nauthorized by applicable law, BlackRock may\nact as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial\nadvisory fees,\n\n47\n\nunderwriting and placement fees, sales fees,\nfinancing and commitment fees, brokerage fees,\nother fees, compensation or profits, rates,\nterms and conditions charged by BlackRock will\nbe in its view commercially reasonable,\nalthough BlackRock, including its sales\npersonnel, will have an interest in obtaining\nfees and other amounts that are favorable to\nBlackRock and such sales personnel, which may\nhave an adverse effect on the Funds. Index\nbased funds may use an index provider that is\naffiliated with another service provider of a\nFund or BlackRock that acts as a broker,\ndealer, agent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel\nand other distributors) will be entitled to\nretain fees and other amounts that they\nreceive in connection with their service to\nthe Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. A Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with a Fund's establishment of its\nbusiness relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall.\n\n48\n\nPurchases and sales of securities and other\nassets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated\nwith orders for other BlackRock client\naccounts, including with accounts that pay\ndifferent transaction costs solely due to the\nfact that they have different research payment\narrangements. BlackRock, however, is not\nrequired to bunch or aggregate orders if\nportfolio management decisions for different\naccounts are made separately, or if they\ndetermine that bunching or aggregating is not\npracticable or required, or in cases involving\nclient direction. Prevailing trading activity\nfrequently may make impossible the receipt of\nthe same price or execution on the entire\nvolume of securities purchased or sold. When\nthis occurs, the various prices may be\naveraged, and the Funds will be charged or\ncredited with the average price. Thus, the\neffect of the aggregation may operate on some\noccasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In\naddition, under certain circumstances, the\nFunds will not be charged the same commission\nor commission equivalent rates in connection\nwith a bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders.\n\n49\n\nBlackRock has adopted policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent conflicts of interest from\ninfluencing proxy voting decisions that it\nmakes on behalf of advisory clients, including\nthe Funds, and to help ensure that such\ndecisions are made in accordance with\nBlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its\nclients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such\nproxy voting policies and procedures, actual\nproxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have\nthe effect of favoring the interests of other\nclients or businesses of other divisions or\nunits of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock\nbelieves such voting decisions to be in\naccordance with its fiduciary obligations. For\na more detailed discussion of these policies\nand procedures, see the Proxy Voting Policy\nsection of this SAI. It is also possible that,\nfrom time to time, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other funds and\nseparately managed accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s\nassets may enhance liquidity, investment\nflexibility and diversification and may\ncontribute to economies of scale that tend to\nreduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock\nreserves the right, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, to sell into the market or\nredeem in Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor\nevents (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to a Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, each Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas each Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in\n\n50\n\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction. The price\ngenerally may not be determined based on what\na Fund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. While fair value determinations will\nbe based upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models, fair value\nrepresents only a good faith approximation of\nthe value of an asset or liability. The fair\nvalue of one or more assets or liabilities may\nnot, in retrospect, be the price at which\nthose assets or liabilities could have been\nsold during the period in which the particular\nfair values were used in determining a Fund\u2019s\nNAV. As a result, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption\nof its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding\nor holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee\nat fair value, may have the effect of diluting\nor increasing the economic interest of\nexisting shareholders and may affect the\namount of revenue received by BFA with respect\nto services for which it receives an asset-\nbased fee. To the extent permitted by\napplicable law, a Fund may invest all or some\nof its short-term cash investments in any\nmoney market fund or similarly-managed private\nfund advised or managed by BlackRock. In\nconnection with any such investments, a Fund,\nto the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may\npay its share of expenses of a money market\nfund or other similarly-managed private fund\nin which it invests, which may result in a\nFund bearing some additional expenses.\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities or\nother investments for their own accounts and\nmay have conflicts of interest with respect to\ninvestments made on behalf of a Fund. As a\nresult of differing trading and investment\nstrategies or constraints, positions may be\ntaken by directors, officers and employees\nthat are the same, different from or made at\ndifferent times than positions taken for a\nFund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund\nwill be adversely affected by this personal\ntrading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have\neach adopted a code of ethics in compliance\nwith Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that\nrestricts securities trading in the personal\naccounts of investment professionals and\nothers who normally come into possession of\ninformation regarding a Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of each Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\na Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance\nwith rules or guidance adopted under the 1940\nAct engage in transactions with another Fund\nor accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as\na result of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when BlackRock may not initiate\nor recommend certain types of transactions, or\nmay otherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\n\n51\n\nIf certain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds\nhave retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation Units of the Funds ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Funds may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. While BlackRock uses\ngood faith estimates of the expected costs to\nthe Funds in determining the rates for fees\ncollected by the Funds related to creation and\nredemption activity, BlackRock may have\nincentives to improve Fund performance through\nthe collection of these fees. As these charges\nare based on estimates, where the charges\nexceed actual transaction- related costs\nand/or expenses incurred by a Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Funds may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof their investment strategy. Index based\nfunds that seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue,\n\n52\n\nin whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could\nresult in conflicts of interest relating to\nthe use or termination of service providers to\na Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may\narise with respect to contractual arrangements\nwith third-party service providers to a Fund,\nor the selection of such providers,\nparticularly in circumstances where BlackRock\nis negotiating on behalf of both funds that\nhave a unitary management fee and those that\ndo not or different service providers have\ndifferent fee structures. Conflicts of\ninterest may arise as a result of simultaneous\ninvestment management of multiple client\naccounts by the BlackRock\u2019s investment\nprofessionals. For example, differences in the\nadvisory fee structure may create the\nappearance of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest because such differences could create\npecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor\none client account over another. BlackRock\nowns or has an ownership interest in certain\ntrading, portfolio management, operations\nand/or information systems used by Fund\nservice providers. These systems are, or will\nbe, used by a Fund service provider in\nconnection with the provision of services to\naccounts managed by BlackRock and funds\nmanaged and sponsored by BlackRock, including\nthe Funds, that engage the service provider\n(typically the custodian). A Fund\u2019s service\nprovider remunerates BlackRock for the use of\nthe systems. A Fund service provider\u2019s\npayments to BlackRock for the use of these\nsystems may enhance the profitability of\nBlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a\nservice provider in connection with the use of\nsystems provided by BlackRock may create an\nincentive for BlackRock to recommend that a\nFund enter into or renew an arrangement with\nthe service provider. In recognition of a\nBlackRock client\u2019s overall relationship with\nBlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to each Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof each Fund, manages and administers the\nTrust and the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. BFA is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of each Fund. Pursuant to the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA may, from\ntime to time, in its sole discretion and to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Funds will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time.\n\n53\n\nFor its investment advisory services to each\nFund, BFA is paid a management fee from each\nFund, as a percentage of each Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.50%.\nBFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees in an amount\nequal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to investments by the\nFunds in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2029 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to each Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to each Fund is terminable\nwithout penalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the\nBoard or by a vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the applicable Fund\u2019s outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940\nAct). The investment advisory agreement is\nalso terminable upon 60 days\u2019 notice by BFA\nand will terminate automatically in the event\nof its assignment (as defined in the 1940\nAct). Portfolio Managers. As of April 30,\n2024, the individuals named as Portfolio\nManagers in the Funds' Prospectus were also\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of other iShares funds and certain\nother types of portfolios and/or accounts as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          364  $2,392,215,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment            2      9,382,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       24     38,098,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          315  $2,194,119,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment           36     15,018,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       62      5,982,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul Whitehead                              \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          521  $2,450,131,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment          377  1,029,343,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts      184    725,136,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Funds and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Funds, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nthey would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts. Like the Funds, the\nother portfolios or accounts for which the\nPortfolio Managers are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day portfolio management\ngenerally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its\naffiliates, as applicable, for its advisory\nservices. One or more of those other\nportfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA\nor its affiliates a performance-based fee in\nlieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee\nfor its advisory services. A portfolio or\naccount with a performance-based fee would pay\nBFA or its affiliates a portion of that\nportfolio\u2019s or account\u2019s gains, or would pay\nBFA or its affiliates more for its services\nthan would otherwise be the case if BFA or any\nof its affiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or\n\n54\n\naccounts, in order to earn larger fees.\nAlthough BFA and each of its affiliates have\nan obligation to allocate resources and\nopportunities equitably among portfolios and\naccounts and intend to do so, shareholders of\nthe Funds should be aware that, as with any\ngroup of portfolios and accounts managed by an\ninvestment adviser and/or its affiliates\npursuant to varying fee arrangements,\nincluding performance-based fee arrangements,\nthere is the potential for a conflict of\ninterest, which may result in the Portfolio\nManagers favoring those portfolios or accounts\nwith performance-based fee arrangements. The\ntables below shows, for each Portfolio\nManager, the number of portfolios or accounts\nof the types set forth in the above tables and\nthe aggregate of total assets in those\nportfolios or accounts with respect to which\nthe investment management fees are based on\nthe performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of April 30, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,853,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of June 17, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance.\n\n55\n\nAs of June 17, 2024, the Portfolio Managers\ndid not beneficially own shares of the Funds.\nCodes of Ethics. The Trust, BFA and the\nDistributor have adopted codes of ethics\npursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The\ncodes of ethics permit personnel subject to\nthe codes of ethics to invest in securities,\nsubject to certain limitations, including\nsecurities that may be purchased or held by\nthe Funds. Each code of ethics is available by\ncontacting BlackRock at the telephone number\non the back cover of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus or\nby accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money Laundering\nRequirements. The Funds are subject to the USA\nPATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ). The\nPatriot Act is intended to prevent the use of\nthe U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, a Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Funds reserve the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin a Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFunds' policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. The Bank of New York Mellon (\n\u201c BNY Mellon \u201d ) serves as administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for the Funds\nunder the Master Services Agreement (the \u201c\nMaster Services Agreement \u201d ). BNY Mellon\u2019s\nprincipal address is 240 Greenwich Street, New\nYork, NY 10286. Pursuant to the Master\nServices Agreement with the Trust, BNY Mellon\nprovides necessary administrative, tax and\naccounting and financial reporting services\nfor the maintenance and operations of the\nTrust and each Fund. In addition, BNY Mellon\nmakes available the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, BNY Mellon\nmaintains, in separate accounts, cash,\nsecurities and other assets of the Trust and\neach Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and\nrecords and provides other services. BNY\nMellon is required, upon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by BNY\nMellon and to make payments for securities\npurchased by the Trust for each Fund. BNY\nMellon is authorized to appoint certain\nforeign custodians or foreign custody managers\nfor Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant\nto the Master Services Agreement with the\nTrust, BNY Mellon acts as a transfer agent for\neach Fund\u2019s authorized and issued shares of\nbeneficial interest, and as dividend\ndisbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation\nfor these services, BNY Mellon receives\ncertain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees\nand asset-based fees which are accrued daily\nand paid monthly by BFA. BFA pays the\ncompensation because it has agreed to pay\nthese operating expenses under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement as described therein.\nJPMorgan serves as custodian for the Funds in\nconnection with certain securities lending\nactivities under a Custody Services Agreement.\nJPMorgan\u2019s principal address is 383 Madison\nAvenue, 11 th Floor, New York, NY 10179.\nPursuant to the Custody Services Agreement\nwith BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides\ncustody and related services required to\nfacilitate securities lending by the Fund.\nJPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary\nto facilitate Fund securities lending activity\nin coordination with other funds, maintains\ncustodial records and provides other services.\nAs compensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC\nfrom its compensation for its services as\nsecurities lending agent. Distributor. The\nDistributor's principal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Funds\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for each Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent\n\n56\n\nTrustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of\nthe outstanding voting securities (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The\nDistribution Agreement will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act). The Distributor\nmay also enter into agreements with securities\ndealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will\nsolicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund\nshares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be\nAuthorized Participants (as described below),\nDTC participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund and Underlying Fund retains a portion of\nthe securities lending income and remits the\nremaining portion to BTC as compensation for\nits services as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund and Underlying Fund are responsible for\nfees in connection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan in\na money market fund managed by BFA (the \u201c\ncollateral investment fees \u201d ); however, BTC\nhas agreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees a Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%.\nSuch money market fund shares will not be\nsubject to a sales load, redemption fee,\ndistribution fee or service fee. Under the\nsecurities lending program, the Funds are\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of a Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC. Pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement:\n(i) fund-of-funds, such as the Funds, retain\n82% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees), and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable fund-of-funds, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: (i) 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. Because the\nFunds are newly launched, no services have\nbeen provided by BTC as the Funds' securities\nlending agent, and the Funds had no income and\nfees/compensation related to securities\nlending activities for the fiscal year ended\nJuly 31, 2023. Payments by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c BFA\nEntities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Funds.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Funds, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Funds and other iShares funds,\nor for other activities, such as participation\nin marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\n\n57\n\nproducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Funds, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products. Payments of the\ntype described above are sometimes referred to\nas revenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\n\n58\n\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund is\ngenerally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as\nfollows: Equity Investments. Equity securities\ntraded on a recognized securities exchange (\ne.g. , NYSE), on separate trading boards of a\nsecurities exchange or through a market system\nthat provides contemporaneous transaction\npricing information (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d )\nare valued using information obtained via\nindependent pricing services, generally at the\nclosing price or, if an Exchange closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on\nthat Exchange prior to the time as of which\nthe assets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by a Fund on a day on which a\nFund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\n\n59\n\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On\nany day the NYSE is open and a foreign market\nor the primary exchange on which a foreign\nasset or liability is traded is closed, such\nasset or liability will be valued using the\nprior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not\naware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a\nFund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair\nValue Assets is subsequently reported to the\nBoard or a committee thereof. When determining\nthe price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will\nseek to determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment.\n\n60\n\nThe fair value of one or more assets or\nliabilities may not, in retrospect, be the\nprice at which those assets or liabilities\ncould have been sold during the period in\nwhich the particular fair values were used in\ndetermining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a result, a\nFund\u2019s sale or redemption of its shares at\nNAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are\nvalued at fair value, may have the effect of\ndiluting or increasing the economic interest\nof existing shareholders. Each Fund\u2019s annual\naudited financial statements, which are\nprepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United\nStates of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d ), follow the\nrequirements for valuation set forth in\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, a Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Funds will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor\n\n61\n\nexecution could be obtained by using a broker.\nPrices paid to a dealer with respect to both\nforeign and domestic securities will generally\ninclude a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween the prices at which the dealer is\nwilling to purchase and sell the specific\nsecurity at the time, and includes the\ndealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940 Act,\npersons affiliated with a Fund and persons who\nare affiliated with such affiliated persons\nare prohibited from dealing with the Fund as\nprincipal in the purchase and sale of\nsecurities unless a permissive order allowing\nsuch transactions is obtained from the SEC.\nSince transactions in the OTC market usually\ninvolve transactions with the dealers acting\nas principal for their own accounts, the Funds\nwill not deal with affiliated persons and\naffiliated persons of such affiliated persons\nin connection with such transactions. The\nFunds will not purchase securities during the\nexistence of any underwriting or selling group\nrelating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL\nor any affiliated person (as defined in the\n1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant\nto procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFunds are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Funds do not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as\n\n62\n\nthe rotation system provides for fair access\nfor all client accounts over time. Other\nallocation methodologies that are considered\nby BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may\nbe used as well. Because different accounts\nmay have differing investment objectives and\npolicies, BFA may buy and sell the same\nsecurities at the same time for different\nclients based on the particular investment\nobjective, guidelines and strategies of those\naccounts. For example, BFA may decide that it\nmay be entirely appropriate for a growth fund\nto sell a security at the same time a value\nfund is buying that security. To the extent\nthat transactions on behalf of more than one\nclient of BFA or the other Affiliates during\nthe same period increase the demand for\nsecurities being purchased or the supply of\nsecurities being sold, there may be an adverse\neffect on price. For example, sales of a\nsecurity by BlackRock on behalf of one or more\nof its clients may decrease the market price\nof such security, adversely impacting other\nBlackRock clients that still hold the\nsecurity. If purchases or sales of securities\narise for consideration at or about the same\ntime that would involve the Funds or other\nclients or funds for which BFA or another\nAffiliate act as investment manager,\ntransactions in such securities will be made,\ninsofar as feasible, for the respective funds\nand clients in a manner deemed equitable to\nall. In certain instances, BFA may find it\nefficient for purposes of seeking to obtain\nbest execution, to aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d\ncertain contemporaneous purchases or sale\norders of its advisory accounts and advisory\naccounts of affiliates. In general, all\ncontemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The Funds'\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Funds and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because each Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation.\n\n63\n\nEach share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which the shareholder is entitled\nto vote. In any matter submitted to\nshareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold\na separate vote, provided that shareholders of\nall affected funds will vote together when:\n(i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the\nTrustees determine that the matter affects the\ninterests of more than one fund. Under\nDelaware law, the Trust is not required to\nhold an annual meeting of shareholders unless\nrequired to do so under the 1940 Act. The\npolicy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless\nof the fund) have noncumulative voting rights\nin the election of members of the Board. Under\nDelaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be\nremoved by vote of the shareholders. Following\nthe creation of the initial Creation Unit(s)\nof shares of a fund and immediately prior to\nthe commencement of trading in such fund\u2019s\nshares, a holder of shares may be a \u201c control\nperson \u201d of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1\nunder the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the\nlength of time for which one or more\nshareholders may remain a control person of\nthe fund. Shareholders may make inquiries by\nwriting to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive,\nPrinceton, NJ 08540. Absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of\nthe shares of a fund may be subject to the\nreporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934\nAct and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\n\n64\n\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on a Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange or the\n\n65\n\nlisting exchange for the Fund\u2019s exchange-\ntraded options close earlier than normal, the\nFunds may require orders to be placed earlier\nin the day. The following table sets forth the\nnumber of shares of each Fund that constitute\na Creation Unit for the Fund and the\napproximate value of such Creation Unit as of\nMay 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                       Shares  ApproximateV\u2026  \n  Fund            PerCreation  PerCreationU\u2026  \n                         Unit        (U.S.$)  \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap            40,000     $1,000,000  \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Mar ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap            40,000      1,000,000  \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Jun ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap            40,000      1,000,000  \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Sep ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap            40,000      1,000,000  \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Dec ETF                                     \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of a\nFund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation Unit.\nThe Board reserves the right to declare a\nsplit or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of a Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year\u2019s Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally\nconsists of Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent computed as described below.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d\nwhich will be applicable (subject to possible\namendment or correction) to creation requests\nreceived in proper form. The Fund Deposit\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of a\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject\nto any adjustments as described below, to\npurchases of Creation Units of shares of a\ngiven Fund until such time as the next-\nannounced Fund Deposit is made available. The\nCash Component is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d\nwhich is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing the Creation Unit. Each\nFund generally offers Creation Units partially\nfor cash, but may, in certain circumstances,\noffer Creation Units solely for cash or solely\nin-kind. Please see the Cash Purchase Method\nsection below and the following discussion\nsummarizing the Deposit Security method for\nfurther information on purchasing Creation\nUnits of a Fund. The identity and number or\npar value of the Deposit Securities change\npursuant to changes in the composition of a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective(s) of a Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. The Fund may, in\nits sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations.\n\n66\n\nCash Purchase Method. Although the Fund does\nnot generally permit full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for a Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of a\nFund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c Participating\nParty, \u201d i.e., a broker-dealer or other\nparticipant in the clearing process through\nthe Continuous Net Settlement System of the\nNSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a clearing\nagency that is registered with the SEC, or\n(ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed\nan agreement with the Distributor, with\nrespect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith a Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFunds, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith a Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Such Authorized Participant\nwill agree, pursuant to the terms of such\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and on behalf\nof itself or any investor on whose behalf it\nwill act, to certain conditions, including\nthat such Authorized Participant will make\navailable in advance of each purchase of\nshares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component, once the NAV of a Creation\nUnit is next determined after receipt of the\npurchase order in proper form, together with\nthe transaction fees described below. An\nAuthorized Participant, acting on behalf of an\ninvestor, may require the investor to enter\ninto an agreement with such Authorized\nParticipant with respect to certain matters,\nincluding payment of the Cash Component.\nInvestors who are not Authorized Participants\nmust make appropriate arrangements with an\nAuthorized Participant. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not be\na DTC Participant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor\u2019s broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Placement of Creation Orders. Fund\nDeposits must be delivered through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), through DTC (for corporate and\nmunicipal securities) or through a central\ndepository account, such as with Euroclear or\nDTC, maintained by BNY Mellon or a sub-\ncustodian (a \u201c Central Depository Account \u201d ).\nAny portion of the Fund Deposit that may not\nbe delivered through the Federal Reserve\nSystem or DTC must be delivered through a\nCentral Depository Account. The Fund Deposit\ntransfers made through DTC must be ordered by\nthe DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as\nto ensure the delivery of the requisite number\nof Deposit Securities through DTC to the\naccount of a Fund generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund\nDeposit transfers made through the Federal\nReserve System must be deposited by the\nparticipant institution in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite\nnumber or amount of Deposit Securities or cash\nthrough the Federal Reserve System to the\naccount of a Fund generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund\nDeposit transfers made through a Central\nDepository Account must be completed pursuant\nto the requirements established by the\ncustodian or sub-custodian for such Central\nDepository Account generally before 2:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. The \u201c\nSettlement Date \u201d for all funds is generally\nthe first business day after the Transmittal\nDate. All questions as to the number of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered, and the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time\nof receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to BNY\nMellon through the Federal Reserve Bank wire\ntransfer system in a timely manner so as to be\nreceived by BNY Mellon generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If\nthe Cash Component and the Deposit Securities\nare not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nthe Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncanceled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using\nthe Fund Deposit as newly\n\n67\n\nconstituted to reflect the then current NAV of\na Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so\ncreated generally will occur no later than the\nfirst Business Day following the day on which\nthe purchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor, provided that the relevant Fund\nDeposit has been received by a Fund prior to\nsuch time. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of a Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to a\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by a Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of a Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund,\nincluding any applicable cash amounts, in\nconnection with any purchase order. Timing of\nSubmission of Purchase Orders. An Authorized\nParticipant must submit an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of a Fund before 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on any Business Day in order to\nreceive that day\u2019s NAV. Creation Orders must\nbe transmitted by an Authorized Participant in\nthe form required by a Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nEconomic or market disruptions or changes, or\ntelephone or other communication failure, may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or\nits agent or an Authorized Participant. A\nFund\u2019s deadline specified above for the\nsubmission of purchase orders is referred to\nas the Fund\u2019s \u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor\nor its agent, in their discretion, may permit\nthe submission of such orders and requests by\nor through an Authorized Participant at any\ntime (including on days on which the Listing\nExchange is not open for business) via\ncommunication through the facilities of the\nDistributor\u2019s or its agent\u2019s proprietary\nwebsite maintained for this purpose. Purchase\norders and redemption requests, if accepted by\nthe Trust, will be processed based on the NAV\nnext determined after such acceptance in\naccordance with a Fund\u2019s Cutoff Times as\nprovided in the Authorized Participant\nAgreement and disclosed in this SAI.\nAcceptance of Orders for Creation Units.\nSubject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor\u2019s behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to a Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, a\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund\u2019s right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once a Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. Each Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, a Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Funds, BNY Mellon, the sub-\ncustodian and\n\n68\n\nthe Distributor or its agent are under no\nduty, however, to give notification of any\ndefects or irregularities in the delivery of\nFund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to a Fund of the Deposit Securities and\nthe payment of the Cash Component have been\ncompleted. When the sub-custodian has\nconfirmed to the custodian that the securities\nincluded in the Fund Deposit (or the cash\nvalue thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-\ncustodians, the Distributor or its agent and\nBFA shall be notified of such delivery and a\nFund will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Unit. Creation Units are generally\nissued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d (i.e., one Business\nDay after trade date). Each Fund reserves the\nright to settle Creation Unit transactions on\na basis other than T+1, including a shorter\nsettlement period, as applicable. For example,\na Fund reserves the right to settle Creation\nUnit transactions on a basis other than T+1 in\norder to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules, to account for different treatment\namong non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend\nrecord dates and ex-dividend dates (i.e., the\nlast day the holder of a security can sell the\nsecurity and still receive dividend (payable\non the security) and in certain other\ncircumstances. To the extent contemplated by\nan Authorized Participant Agreement with the\nDistributor, each Fund will issue Creation\nUnits to such Authorized Participant,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant\u2019s\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for a Fund. Such collateral must be\ndelivered no later than the time specified by\na Fund or its custodian on the contractual\nsettlement date. Information concerning a\nFund\u2019s current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit a Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, each Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by such\nFund and the Fund\u2019s determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, a Fund\nhas retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each creation\norder, which consists of (1) a fee for\nproviding the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs charged by a Fund\ncustodian in connection with the issuance of\nCreation Units for such creation order ( \u201c\nCustody Transaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to a Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent BlackRock-advised funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a fund\u2019s Creation\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets\nand settlement locations associated with the\nissuance of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth a Fund\u2019s standard creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nas of May 31, 2024, although the actual fee\ncharged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\ndepending on the factors discussed above, and\nmay be higher than the fee set forth below. If\na purchase consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution, price movement and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs).\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Deposit Securities\nto a Fund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services.

The standard\ncreation transaction fee may vary over time\ndepending on the factors discussed above, and\nmay be higher than the see set forth above. **\nAs a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\ncreation transaction fee. Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of a Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Funds will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. Each Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Funds. Each Fund\npublishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) are applicable,\nin order to effect redemptions of Creation\nUnits of the Fund. Such Fund Securities and\nCash Amount will remain in effect until such\ntime as the next announced composition of the\nFund Securities and Cash Amount is made\navailable. The Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nare subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning redemption transactions are set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants and may change from time to time.\nUnless cash redemptions are available or\nspecified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds\nfor a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund\nSecurities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an\namount equal to the difference between the net\nasset value of the shares being redeemed, as\nnext determined after the receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form, and the\nvalue of Fund Securities, less a redemption\ntransaction fee (as described below). The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to replace any Fund\nSecurity in certain circumstances, including:\n(i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to\nthe Authorized Participant (or to an investor\non whose behalf the Authorized Participant is\nacting) would be restricted under applicable\nsecurities or other local laws or due to a\ntrading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of\na Fund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the disposition of the Fund\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Funds generally\nredeem Creation Units for Fund Securities, but\nthe Funds reserve the right to utilize a cash\noption for redemption of Creation Units. A\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket.\n\n70\n\nCash Redemption Method. Although the Trust\ndoes not generally permit partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units of its funds,\nwhen partial or full cash redemptions of\nCreation Units are available or specified for\na Fund, they will be effected in essentially\nthe same manner as in-kind redemptions\nthereof. In the case of partial or full cash\nredemption, the Authorized Participant\nreceives the cash equivalent of the Fund\nSecurities it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by a\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, a Fund has retained BRIL,\nan affiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF\nServices. BRIL will receive from an Authorized\nParticipant a standard transaction fee on each\nredemption order, which consists of (1) the\nETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction\nCosts. BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF\nServicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services\nAgreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody\nTransaction Costs to a Fund custodian\naccording to the amounts invoiced by such\ncustodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee\nper order regardless of the number of Creation\nUnits being redeemed, which amount will vary\namong different BlackRock-advised funds based\non a number of factors, including the\ncomplexity of the order and the types of\nsecurities or instruments included in a fund\u2019s\nRedemption Basket, among other variables. The\nactual Custody Transaction Costs vary per\norder based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets, and settlement locations\nassociated with the redemption of a Creation\nUnit. The following table sets forth a Fund\u2019s\nstandard redemption transaction fee that would\nhave been charged as of May 31, 2024, although\nthe actual fee charged to an Authorized\nParticipant in connection with a redemption\norder will vary depending on the factors\ndiscussed above, and may be higher than the\nfee set forth below. If a redemption consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution,\nprice movement and other costs and expenses\nrelated to the execution of trades resulting\nfrom such transaction (which may, in certain\ninstances, be based on a good faith estimate\nof transaction costs). Authorized Participants\nwill also bear the costs of transferring the\nFund Securities from a Fund to their account\non their order. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith redemption transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. In addition,\nan Authorized Participant will be required to\nbear a custody settlement charge of $5 per\noption transaction in connection with a\nredemption. The following table sets forth the\nFund\u2019s standard redemption transaction fee\nthat would have been charged as of May 31,\n2024 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n                                              \n                     Standard  Maximum        \n  Fund          RedemptionTr\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                         Fee*  for            \n                               Redemptions**  \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap           $311.25  2.0%           \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Mar ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap           $311.25  2.0%           \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Jun ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap           $311.25  2.0%           \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Sep ETF                                     \n  iShares                                     \n  Large Cap           $311.25  2.0%           \n  Max Buffer                                  \n  Dec ETF                                     \n                                              \n* The standard redemption transaction fee\nconsists of the ETF Servicing Fee and Custody\nTransaction Costs. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee may vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth above. ** As a\npercentage of the net asset value per Creation\nUnit, inclusive of the standard redemption\ntransaction fee. Placement of Redemption\nOrders. Redemption requests for Creation Units\nof a Fund must be submitted to the Distributor\nor its agent by or through an Authorized\nParticipant. An Authorized Participant must\nsubmit an irrevocable request to redeem shares\nof a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime on any Business Day, in order to receive\nthat day\u2019s NAV. On days when the Listing\nExchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund\nmay require orders to redeem Creation Units to\nbe placed earlier that day. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a redemption\nrequest to be made through an Authorized\nParticipant. The Distributor or its agent will\nprovide a list of current Authorized\nParticipants upon request. The Authorized\nParticipant must transmit the request for\nredemption in the form required by a Fund to\nthe Distributor or its agent in accordance\nwith procedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not\nhave executed an Authorized Participant\nAgreement and that, therefore, requests to\nredeem Creation Units may have to be placed by\nthe investor\u2019s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant who has executed an\n\n71\n\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to a Fund\u2019s transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to a Fund\u2019s transfer\nagent the Creation Unit redeemed through the\nbook-entry system of DTC so as to be effective\nby the Listing Exchange closing time on any\nBusiness Day on which the redemption request\nis submitted; (ii) a request in form\nsatisfactory to a Fund is received by the\nDistributor or its agent from the Authorized\nParticipant on behalf of itself or another\nredeeming investor within the time periods\nspecified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a Fund\nand the Fund\u2019s transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor\u2019s shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Funds are generally made\nwithin one Business Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ).\nHowever, each Fund reserves the right to\nsettle redemption transactions on a basis\nother than T+1, including a shorter settlement\nperiod, if necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. Delayed settlement may occur due to a\nnumber of different reasons, including,\nwithout limitation, settlement cycles for the\nunderlying securities, unscheduled market\nclosings, an effort to link distribution to\ndividend record dates and ex-dates and newly\nannounced holidays. If a Fund includes a\nforeign investment in its basket, and if a\nlocal market holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. If neither the\nAuthorized Participant nor the Beneficial\nOwner on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting has appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of Fund\nSecurities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in\nits discretion exercise its option to redeem\nsuch shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In such case, the investor\nwill receive a cash payment equal to the net\nasset value of its shares based on the NAV of\na Fund next determined after the redemption\nrequest is received in proper form (minus a\nredemption transaction fee and additional\ncharges specified above to offset a Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and a Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\u2019s\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or\nprior to the time specified by the Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby BNY Mellon and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of BNY Mellon and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits a Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\n\n72\n\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. The right of redemption may\nbe suspended or the date of payment postponed\nwith respect to the Funds: (i) for any period\nduring which the Listing Exchange is closed\n(other than customary weekend and holiday\nclosings); (ii) for any period during which\ntrading on the Listing Exchange is suspended\nor restricted; (iii) for any period during\nwhich an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Funds will accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for a Fund and impose\ndifferent requirements for different types of\ncustom baskets in order to seek to mitigate\nagainst potential risks of conflicts and/or\noverreaching by an Authorized Participant.\nBlackRock has established a governance process\nto oversee basket compliance for a Fund, as\nset forth in each Fund\u2019s policies and\nprocedures. Taxation on Creations and\nRedemptions of Creation Units. An Authorized\nParticipant generally will recognize either\ngain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units. This gain or\nloss is calculated by taking the market value\nof the Creation Units purchased over the\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s aggregate basis in\nthe Deposit Securities exchanged therefor.\nHowever, the IRS may apply the wash sales\nrules to determine that any loss realized upon\nthe exchange of Deposit Securities for\nCreation Units is not currently deductible.\nAuthorized Participants should consult their\nown tax advisors. Current U.S. federal income\ntax laws dictate that capital gain or loss\nrealized from the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally create long-term capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized Participant holds\nthe Creation Units for more than one year, or\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the\nCreation Units were held for one year or less,\nif the Creation Units are held as capital\nassets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. References to the Funds\nwill also generally apply to the Underlying\nFunds as well. Regulated Investment Company\nQualifications. Each Fund intends to qualify\nfor treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes\n\n73\n\nof this calculation in respect of any one\nissuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s assets and not greater\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of\nthe value of each Fund's total assets may be\ninvested in the securities (other than U.S.\ngovernment securities or the securities of\nother RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more\nissuers of which 20% or more of the voting\nstock is held by the Fund and that are engaged\nin the same or similar trades or businesses or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly-\ntraded partnerships. A Fund may be able to\ncure a failure to derive at least 90% of its\nincome from the sources specified above or a\nfailure to diversify its holdings in the\nmanner described above by paying a tax and/or\nby disposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A\nFund will be subject to income tax at regular\ncorporate rates on any taxable income or gains\nthat it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to\nqualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out\nits earnings and profits accumulated in that\nyear in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, the Fund may\nbe required to recognize any net built-in\ngains with respect to certain of its assets (\ni.e., the excess of the aggregate gains,\nincluding items of income, over aggregate\nlosses that would have been realized with\nrespect to such assets if the Fund had been\nliquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. A Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nLong-term capital distributions from the\nUnderlying Funds paid in December or, in\ncertain cases, January in satisfaction of this\nrule will be subject to potential distribution\nby the Funds in the following calendar year.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by a Fund are generally treated\nunder the Internal Revenue Code as received by\nthe shareholders at the time the dividend or\ndistribution is made. However, any dividend or\ndistribution declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of any calendar year and\npayable to shareholders of record on a\n\n74\n\nspecified date in such a month shall be deemed\nto have been received by each shareholder on\nDecember 31 of such calendar year and to have\nbeen paid by the Fund not later than such\nDecember 31, provided such dividend is\nactually paid by the Fund during January of\nthe following calendar year. Each Fund intends\nto distribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income and any net realized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net realized short-\nterm capital losses (including any capital\nloss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains\nfor investment an amount equal to all or a\nportion of its net long-term capital gains in\nexcess of its net short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers), it\nwill be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat\nrate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that\nevent, the Fund will designate such retained\namounts as undistributed capital gains in a\nnotice to its shareholders who (a) will be\nrequired to include in income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, as long-term capital\ngains, their proportionate shares of the\nundistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to\ncredit their proportionate shares of the tax\npaid by the Fund on the undistributed amount\nagainst their U.S. federal income tax\nliabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to\nthe extent their credits exceed their\nliabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled\nto increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, in their shares by an\namount equal to the excess of the amount in\nclause (a) over the amount in clause (b).\nOrganizations or persons not subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such capital gains will\nbe entitled to a refund of their pro rata\nshare of such taxes paid by the Fund upon\nfiling appropriate returns or claims for\nrefund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Because the Funds are\nexpected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the\nFund\u2019s realized losses on sales of shares of\nthe Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or\npermanently deferred as \u201c wash sales. \u201d\nDistributions of short-term capital gains by\nthe Underlying Fund will be recognized as\nordinary income by a Fund and would not be\noffset by a Fund\u2019s capital loss carryforwards,\nif any. Capital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, would not offset net\ncapital gains of a Fund. Long-term capital\ngains are eligible for taxation at a maximum\nrate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts. If\nan individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of a Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of a\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of a Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired\n\n75\n\nsuch security. Accordingly, in order to\nsatisfy its income distribution requirements,\na Fund may be required to pay dividends based\non anticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, a Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder\nwill realize a taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nthe shareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund.\nA redemption of shares by a Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of each Fund, has the right to reject\nan order for a purchase of shares of the Fund\nif the purchaser (or group of purchasers)\nwould, upon obtaining the shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a\ngiven Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351\nand 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that\nFund would have a basis in the securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s\nbasis in such securities on the date of\ndeposit was less than market value on such\ndate, the Fund, upon disposition of the\nsecurities, would recognize more taxable gain\nor less taxable loss than if its basis in the\nsecurities had been equal to market value. It\nis not anticipated that the Trust will\nexercise the right of rejection except in a\ncase where the Trust determines that accepting\nthe order could result in material adverse tax\nconsequences to a Fund or its shareholders.\nThe Trust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. Treatment of the FLEX Options.\nA Fund\u2019s investments in offsetting positions\nwith respect to the Underlying ETF may be \u201c\nstraddles \u201d for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. The straddle rules may affect the\ncharacter of gains (or losses) realized by a\nFund, and losses realized by a Fund on\npositions that are part of a straddle may be\ndeferred under the straddle rules, rather than\nbeing taken into account in calculating\ntaxable income for the taxable year in which\nthe losses are realized. In addition,\n\n76\n\ncertain carrying charges (including interest\nexpense) associated with positions in a\nstraddle may be required to be capitalized\nrather than deducted currently. Certain\nelections that a Fund may make with respect to\nits straddle positions may also affect the\namount, character and timing of the\nrecognition of gains or losses from the\naffected positions. The tax consequences of\nstraddle transactions to a Fund are not\nentirely clear in all situations under\ncurrently available authority. The straddle\nrules may increase the amount of short-term\ncapital gain realized by a Fund, which is\ntaxed as ordinary income when distributed to\nU.S. shareholders in a non-liquidating\ndistribution. Because application of the\nstraddle rules may affect the character of\ngains or losses, defer losses and/or\naccelerate the recognition of gains or losses\nfrom the affected straddle positions, if a\nFund makes a non-liquidating distribution of\nits short-term capital gain, the amount which\nU.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary\nincome may be increased or decreased\nsubstantially as compared to a Fund that did\nnot engage in such transactions. The FLEX\nOptions included in the portfolio are\nexchange-traded options. Under Section 1256 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, certain types of\nexchange-traded options are treated as if they\nwere sold (i.e., \u201c marked to market \u201d ) at the\nend of each year. The Funds do not believe\nthat the positions held by the Funds will be\nsubject to Section 1256, which means that the\npositions will not be marked to market, but\nthe positions will be subject to the straddle\nrules. Taxation of Certain Derivatives. A\nFund\u2019s transactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund (i.e., may affect whether gains or losses\nare ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require a Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they\nwere closed out at the end of each year) and\n(b) may cause a Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of the Fund as a RIC. A\nFund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). The cost of any\npayments made by a Fund on a swap transaction\nwill be netted pro rata against both tax\nexempt and taxable gross income. With respect\nto certain types of swaps, a Fund may be\nrequired to currently recognize income or loss\nwith respect to future payments on such swaps\nor may elect under certain circumstances to\nmark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\na Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and a Fund reports the\ndistribution as qualified dividend income. The\nFunds do not expect that a significant portion\nof their distributions will consist of\nqualified dividend income or be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Qualified\ndividend income is, in general, dividend\nincome from taxable U.S. corporations (but\ngenerally not from U.S. REITs) and certain\nnon-U.S. corporations ( e.g. , non-U.S.\ncorporations that are not PFICs and which are\nincorporated in a possession\n\n77\n\nof the U.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but\nnot with Hong Kong, which is treated as a\nseparate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes),\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom a Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from the Underlying Funds and that\nare attributable to dividends paid by U.S.\ncorporations may qualify for the U.S. federal\ndividends received deduction for corporations.\nA 46-day minimum holding period during the\n90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-\ndividend date (or 91-day minimum holding\nperiod during the 180 period beginning 90 days\nprior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at the Fund level, the\nUnderlying Fund level and shareholder level,\nfor a dividend to be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Restrictions may\napply if indebtedness, including a short sale,\nis attributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a\nFund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by the\nUnderlying Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt such as individual retirement\naccounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans,\npension plans and certain charitable entities;\n(ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable\ndeductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be\neligible for reduced U.S. withholding for\nnon-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty\ncountries; and (iv) cause the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund to be subject to tax if\ncertain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. A Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but a Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, a Fund\nmay not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require a Fund to forego\notherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n\n78\n\nReporting. If a shareholder recognizes a loss\nwith respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million\nor more for an individual shareholder or $10\nmillion or more for a corporate shareholder,\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases exempted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The\nfact that a loss is reportable under these\nregulations does not affect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. A foreign\nshareholder also may be subject to certain \u201c\nwash sale \u201d rules to prevent the avoidance of\nthe tax filing and payment obligations\ndiscussed above through the sale and\nrepurchase of Fund shares. Shareholders that\nare nonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in a Fund.\n\n79\n\nSeparately, a 30% withholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and\nother income items paid to: (i) foreign\nfinancial institutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they agree to collect\nand disclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of a Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-MAX-1024\n"
