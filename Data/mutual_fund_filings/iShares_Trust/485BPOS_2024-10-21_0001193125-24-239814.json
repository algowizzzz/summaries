Example.\nThis Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of owning\nshares of the Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time\nperiods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses\nremain the same. Although your\nactual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n\nS-1\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $20         $64  \n                   \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Because the Fund is\nnew, there is no reportable\nturnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe S&P 500 Top 20 Select Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of\nthe 20 largest U.S. companies by\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization within the S&P 500\n\u00ae (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ) as\ndetermined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The securities\nin the Underlying Index are\nweighted based on the float-\nadjusted market value of their\noutstanding shares subject to\ncapping. For capping purposes,\nthe Underlying Index will be\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis.\nAt each quarterly rebalance in\nMarch, June, September, and\nDecember, the weight of any\nsingle issuer will not exceed\n22.5% of the Underlying Index;\nand the aggregate weight of\nissuers with individual weights\nexceeding 4.5% will not exceed\n48% of the Underlying Index.\nBetween rebalances, constituent\nweights may exceed these\nconstraints due to fluctuations\nin market value, corporate\nactions, or other events that\nchange the index composition. As\nof August 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index\nis represented by securities of\ncompanies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The\ncomponents of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not\nseek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or\nappear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as S-2\n\nreturn variability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least\n80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest\nup to 20% of its assets in\ncertain futures, options and swap\ncontracts, cash and cash\nequivalents, including shares of\nmoney market funds advised by BFA\nor its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the\nUnderlying Index, but which BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments\nassociated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part\nof that position for the purposes\nof calculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks\nto track the investment results\nof the Underlying Index before\nfees and expenses of the Fund.\nThe Fund may lend securities\nrepresenting up to one-third of\nthe value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of\nany collateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is a product of\nSPDJI, which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Summary of\nPrincipal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk\nis difficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Risk of Investing in\nthe U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes\nin value, and their values may be\nmore volatile than those of other\nasset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number\nof reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as\ndue to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred\nsecurities and debt in a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure.\nCommon stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk,\nwith respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event\nof an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nS-3 Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThe Index Provider may rely on\nvarious sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components\nof the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be\nbased on assumptions and\nestimates. Neither the Fund nor\nBFA can offer assurances that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of\nincluded components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or\nthe construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur,\nand the Index Provider may not\nidentify or correct them promptly\nor at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and\nits shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nless able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances\nmay have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel.\nThese companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially\nrapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may\nface unexpected risks and costs\nassociated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on\nintellectual property rights and\nmay be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those\nrights. Technology companies may\nface increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal\naction. Asset Class Risk. The\nsecurities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To S-4 the extent\nthat Authorized Participants exit\nthe business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for\nthe Fund and no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Cybersecurity Risk\n. Failures or breaches of the\nelectronic systems of the Fund,\nits adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or\nissuers of assets in which the\nFund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans and risk management systems\nseeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems. The Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not\nfully replicate the Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that the investment\nstrategy of BFA may not produce\nthe intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares\n(including through a trading\nhalt), losses from trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions\nin the process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk\n. To the extent the Fund is non-\ndiversified, the Fund may invest\na large percentage of its assets\nin securities or other\ninstruments S-5 representing a\nsmall number of issuers or\ncounterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular\nissuers or counterparties. As a\nresult, the Fund's performance\nmay depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number\nof issuers or counterparties,\nwhich may lead to more volatility\nin the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but\nnot limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that\nthe Fund may lose money because\nthe borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund\nmay be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a\nnumber of factors, including\ndifferences between the\nsecurities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index;\ndifferences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets;\ntransaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index; and impacts to\nthe Fund of complying with\ncertain regulatory requirements\nor limits. Tracking error risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nPerformance Information As of the\ndate of the Prospectus, the Fund\nhas not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance\ninformation to report. S-6\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr.\nWhitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since\ninception (2024). Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly\nreferred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may\nonly be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather\nthan at NAV, shares may trade at\na price greater than NAV (a\npremium) or less than NAV (a\ndiscount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the\ndifference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay\nto purchase shares of the Fund\n(bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when\nbuying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Tax Information The\nFund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an IRA, in which case, your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information.

The market\nprice for a share of the Fund may\nbe different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and\nis designed to be used as part of\nbroader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an\ninvestment in the Fund should not\nconstitute a complete investment\nprogram. An investment in the\nFund is not a bank deposit, and\nit is not insured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government\nagency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share\nof the Fund represents an\nownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\n(as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. An index is a financial\ncalculation, based on a grouping\nof financial instruments, and is\nnot an investment product, while\nthe Fund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and that of its Underlying\nIndex may vary for a number of\nreasons, including transaction\ncosts, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions,\ntiming variances and differences\nbetween the composition of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio and that of the\nUnderlying Index resulting from\nthe Fund\u2019s use of representative\nsampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nits Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the provider of the\nUnderlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to\nthe index methodology or other\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s performance on a going-\nforward basis after the effective\ndate of such change. Therefore,\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex that\n\n1\n\nis shown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\ngenerally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to\nreflect the change. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of the\napplicable underlying index.\nBecause the Fund uses\nrepresentative sampling, it can\nbe expected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. \u201c\nReplication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. Additional Information\nAbout the Fund's Risks Each Fund\nis subject to various risks, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose\nall or part of your investment in\na Fund, which could underperform\nother investments. The principal\nand other (non-principal) risks\nthat apply to the Fund are\ndescribed below. A Fund that\ninvests in an Underlying Fund\nalso may be indirectly exposed to\nthese risks through such\ninvestment. Principal Risks Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and\nother assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio or, if applicable, its\nUnderlying Index may underperform\nin comparison to indexes that\ntrack, or assets that represent,\nother countries or geographic\nunits, industries, markets,\nmarket segments, or asset\nclasses. Various types of\nsecurities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause a Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and 2 higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to\nadverse events that affect the\nFund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent\nthat the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or\nother assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and\nentities that interact with the\nFund are susceptible to\noperational, information security\nand related cybersecurity risks,\nboth directly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with a\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to a Fund\u2019s\nfunctioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. A Fund\nmay incur substantial costs in\norder to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, a Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother 3 third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could\nbe negatively impacted as a\nresult. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to\nchanges in value due to general\nmarket or economic conditions,\nperceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a\nnumber of factors relating to a\nspecific issuer. Investments in\nequity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in\nother asset classes. Equity\nsecurities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated\nto debt securities in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure, and so equity\nholders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the\nevent of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy.\nCommon stock has the lowest\npriority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to\ndividends and any liquidation\npayments. Index-Related Risk. A\nFund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of its\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither a Fund nor BFA can offer\nassurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of an Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to an Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact a Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact an\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that 4 would\notherwise be removed at the\nrebalance (due to, for example,\nchanges in market capitalization\nor issuer credit ratings) may\nremain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the\nUnderlying Index to vary from\nthose expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the\nextent circumstances evolve\nbetween periodic index reviews\nand reconstitutions, an\nUnderlying Index may include\nconstituents that do not align\nwith its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking\nthe Underlying Index may be\nsimilarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The\nrelevant Fund will in turn\nrebalance its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio\nand the Underlying Index. The\nFund and its shareholders will\ndirectly bear any transaction\ncosts and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing.\nTherefore, index-related errors\nand ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and\ntracking error. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a\nwhole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Management\nRisk. The Fund invests in\nsecurities or other assets\nincluded in, or representative\nof, its Underlying Index,\nregardless of their investment\nmerits. The Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market\nsegments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. A Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\n5 counterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non a Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nany of which may lead to its\nshares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount\nto NAV or to the intraday value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nIf you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\npremium to NAV or sell Fund\nshares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the\nNAV, you may pay significantly\nmore or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of\nthe Fund shares. Absence of an\nActive Primary Market. Although\nFund shares are listed for\ntrading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary\ntrading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund\u2019s primary listing\nis maintained. Fund shares also\nmay be available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or\nstructured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that a\nFund\u2019s shares will continue to\ntrade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s\nshares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in\nothers, and investors are subject\nto the execution and settlement\nrisks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\nthat is available to investors\nwho trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be\navailable to investors who trade\nin other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\na Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\n6 Secondary market trading in\nFund shares may be halted by a\nstock exchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt a\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in a\nFund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, a Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of a Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on a\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of a Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of a Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares\nmay deviate significantly from\nNAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to a Fund\u2019s NAV are not\nlikely to be sustained over the\nlong term (unlike shares of many\nclosed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of a Fund that\ndiffer significantly from its\nNAV. Authorized Participants may\nbe less willing to create or\nredeem a Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the 7\ndifference between what investors\nare willing to pay for Fund\nshares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and\nthe price at which they are\nwilling to sell Fund shares (the\n\u201c ask \u201d price). The spread varies\nover time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market\nliquidity. It is generally\nnarrower if a Fund has more\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity and wider if a Fund has\nless trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market\nvolatility also may cause wider\nspreads. In addition, there may\nbe regulatory and other charges\nthat are incurred as a result of\ntrading activity. Because of the\ncosts inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent\ntrading may detract significantly\nfrom investment results, and an\ninvestment in Fund shares may not\nbe advisable for investors who\nanticipate regularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Non-Diversification\nRisk. A Fund that is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified \u201d may invest\na greater percentage of its\nassets in securities or other\ninstruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with\nfunds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified\nFund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have\na greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the\nperformance of a diversified\nFund, and a non-diversified\nFund\u2019s NAV may be more volatile.\nOperational Risk. Each Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. Each Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. Investing\nin U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other\nrisks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also\nsubject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods.\nU.S. security risks include acts\nof terrorism, internal unrest and\na deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. A Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that a Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned 8 securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. A Fund could\nalso lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for a Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources and\npersonnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product\nintroduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nmay be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and\ndistribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners.\nThey are heavily dependent on\npatent and other intellectual\nproperty rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their\nprofitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or\nlegal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, actual or\nperceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects\nin their products and services,\nwhich may result in lawsuits,\ngovernment enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that\ntracks an index is subject to the\nrisk of \u201c tracking error, \u201d which\nis the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nand those included in the\nUnderlying Index; differences in\nthe timing and methodologies used\nto value securities and other\nassets; transaction costs and\nother expenses incurred by a Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for a\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index, such as during\na rebalancing or reconstitution;\nand impacts to a Fund of\ncomplying with certain regulatory\nrequirements or limits. A Fund\nthat tracks an index composed of\na large number of securities or\nother assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a\nFund that tracks a more narrow\nindex. Tracking error risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nOther Risks The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Close-Out\nRisk for Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are\npart of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards 9 and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund.\nCommunication Services Sector\nRisk. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies\nin the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the\nmedia and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the\ntelecommunication services\nindustry group include providers\nof fiber-optic, fixed-line,\ncellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks.\nCompanies in the media and\nentertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking\nplatforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and\nInternet search engines.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected\nby industry competition,\nsubstantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications\nproducts and services due to\ntechnological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while\nall companies may be susceptible\nto network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of\nproprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. The communication\nservices sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with\ngovernmental regulations, delays\nor failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively\naffect the business of\ncommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the\nworld, specifically in the area\nof pre-marketing clearance of\nproducts and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry\ncan also be significantly\naffected by intense competition\nfor market share, including\ncompetition with alternative\ntechnologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product\ncompatibility and\nstandardization, consumer\npreferences, rapid product\nobsolescence, research and\ndevelopment of new products, lack\nof standardization or\ncompatibility with existing\ntechnologies, and a dependency on\npatent and copyright protections.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the\nneed to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in\ndeveloping new products and\nservices using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may\nmake the products and services of\ncertain communications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders with exposure to the\nU.S. are generally required to\nobtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide 10 an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\nTelecommunication providers\ninvesting in non-U.S. countries\nmay be subject to similar risks.\nAdditional risks include those\nrelated to competitive challenges\nin the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic\njoint ventures with U.S.\ncompanies and in non-U.S. markets\nfrom both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries can be significantly\naffected by several factors,\nincluding competition,\nparticularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new\ntechnologies, cyclicality of\nrevenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted\nindividuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the\npotential increase in government\nregulation. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries may become obsolete\nquickly. Advertising spending can\nbe an important revenue source\nfor media and entertainment\ncompanies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending\ntypically decreases and, as a\nresult, media and entertainment\ncompanies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Many\nconsumer goods and services\ncompanies ( \u201c consumer companies\n\u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer\nspending and may be impacted by\nsocial trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and\nother factors affecting consumer\npreferences and demand. In\naddition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on\nconsumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those\nproviding more discretionary\ngoods or services, may depend\nmore on business cycles, overall\neconomic conditions and consumer\nconfidence. Many consumer goods\nand services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the\nrelated compliance costs, and\nconsumer companies also face the\nrisk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be\nadversely affected by volatility\nin commodity prices, supply chain\ndisruptions and labor shortages.\nFinancial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental\nregulation and intervention,\nwhich may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and\nliquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other\nthings. Financial services\ncompanies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among\nother things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, adverse public\nperception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-\ntaking by financial companies may\nresult in greater overall risk in\nthe global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an\nunusually high degree of\nvolatility in financial markets\nand pose the risk of large losses\nfor financial services companies.\nFinancial companies frequently\noperate with substantial\nfinancial leverage and are\nexposed directly to the credit\nrisk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree.\nFinancial companies may have\nsignificant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as\na result, a borrower\u2019s or 11\ncounterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company\nmay affect other financial\ncompanies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk\nmay result in significant\nnegative impacts to companies\nwith direct exposure to the\ndefaulting counterparty as well\nas adverse cascading effects in\nthe markets and the financial\nsector generally. Healthcare\nCompanies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be\nadversely affected by the\nfollowing factors, among others:\nextensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing\npressure, a limited number of\nproducts, labor shortages, supply\nchain issues and industry\ninnovation. Many new products in\nthe healthcare sector entail\nsignificant research and\ndevelopment and require\nregulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such\nefforts ultimately may be\nunsuccessful. Many healthcare\ncompanies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents,\nwhich can be costly, and may be\nadversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare\ncompanies also are subject to\nextensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar\nclaims. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. The Fund may not acquire\nany illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have\ninvested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments.\nAn illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold\nor disposed of in current market\nconditions in seven calendar days\nor less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments or the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments. To the extent\nthat the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nAlthough the Fund primarily seeks\nto redeem shares of the Fund on\nan in-kind basis, if the Fund is\nforced to sell underlying\ninvestments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to\nmeet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may\nsuffer a loss. This may be\nmagnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions\nfrom the Fund may be greater than\nnormal. Other market participants\nmay be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as the\nFund, causing increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments\nin the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund 12 will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Large Shareholder and Large-\nScale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of a Fund, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of\ntime. These shareholders may also\npledge or loan Fund shares (to\nsecure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares\nbecoming concentrated in another\nparty. There can be no assurance\nthat any large shareholder or\nlarge group of shareholders would\nnot redeem their investment or\nthat the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent a Fund permits redemptions\nin cash, these redemptions may\nforce the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when\nit might not otherwise do so,\nwhich may negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares, increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains, and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such tax year. A Fund\nalso may be required to sell its\nmore liquid investments to meet a\nlarge redemption, in which case\nthe Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile,\nand more difficult to price. To\nthe extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk.\nIf certain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor a Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including a Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. The\ncapacity of a Fund to invest in\ncertain securities or other\nassets may be affected by the\nrelevant threshold limits, and\nsuch limitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. To the extent a Fund\ntracks an index, such limits may\nincrease the risk of the Fund\nbeing underinvested in an asset\nrelative to its Underlying Index\nand increase the risk of tracking\nerror. 13 For example, ownership\nlimits may apply to securities\nwhose issuers operate in certain\nregulated industries or in\ncertain international markets.\nSuch limits also may apply where\nthe investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or\nregulatory ownership restrictions\nor invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including a Fund) may not exceed\nthe relevant limits without the\ngrant of a license or other\nregulatory or corporate consent.\nIn other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its\naffiliates, a Fund or other\nclient accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the\npolicies and procedures with\nrespect to the disclosure of the\nFunds\u2019 portfolio securities and\nother assets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com.

BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the\ninvestment of the Funds\u2019 assets.\nIn seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives,\nBFA uses teams of portfolio\nmanagers, investment strategists\nand other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading,\nresearch and expertise of its\naffiliates. This team approach\nbrings together many disciplines\nand leverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. BFA is an indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand is located at 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105.\nAs of September 30, 2024, BFA and\nits affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.5\ntrillion. From time to time, an\nemployee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular\nsecurity or other instrument,\nasset class, company, industry,\nor market sector. Such views are\nthe views of only that individual\nas of the time expressed. They do\nnot necessarily represent the\nviews of BlackRock or any other\nperson within the BlackRock\norganization. Such views may\nchange at any time based upon\nmarket or other conditions, and\nBlackRock has no responsibility\nto update such views. You should\nnot rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an\nindication of trading intent on\nbehalf of a Fund. 14\n\nFees and Expenses Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFunds), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c\nBoard \u201d ) of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA will\nbe available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filed with the SEC for the\nperiod ending March 31, 2025 and\nin the applicable financial\nstatements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its\ninvestment advisory services to\nthe Fund, BFA is paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund\u2019s\naverage daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate set forth in the\ntable below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees\nfor a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon\nwritten agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. In addition, BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks  0.20%           \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio\nManagers for the Fund are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more\nlimited responsibilities.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and\nPaul Whitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund.

BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and in the\nordinary course of business may\nengage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof other clients may conflict\nwith those of a Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider,\ninvestment manager, commodity\npool operator, commodity trading\nadvisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal.\nBFA and its Affiliates may have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in\nwhich a Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest.

This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies, including investment\ncompanies that are affiliated\nwith the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nits Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a\nFund. These activities may result\nin BFA or an Affiliate having\npositions in assets that are\nsenior or junior to, or that have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the assets held by a\nFund. A Fund may invest in\nsecurities issued by, or engage\nin other transactions with,\nentities with which an Affiliate\nhas significant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances\n(such as debt offerings or\nstructured notes) for which an\nAffiliate is compensated for\nproviding advisory, cash\nmanagement or other\n\n16\n\nservices. A Fund also may invest\nin securities of, or engage in\nother transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides\nor may provide research coverage\nor other analysis. An Affiliate\nmay have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation\nfrom, distributors, consultants\nor others who recommend a Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for a Fund. Neither BlackRock\nnor any Affiliate is under any\nobligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with a Fund. As a\nresult, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate\ninvestment opportunities. The\nresults of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of\nother accounts managed by an\nAffiliate. It is possible that a\nFund could sustain losses during\nperiods in which one or more\nAffiliates and other accounts\nachieve profits on their trading\nfor proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, a\nFund may enter into transactions\nin which BFA or an Affiliate or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. A Fund may be\nadversely impacted by the effects\nof transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their\ndirectors, officers, employees or\nclients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and\naccounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of a\nFund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients. A Fund\u2019s\nactivities may be limited because\nof regulatory restrictions\napplicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to\ncomply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to\nthe extent that they participate\nin the securities lending\nprogram. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s\nlending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received\nas collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the\nentities to which a Fund may lend\nits portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement,\ncertain Funds have retained\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of\nthe standard transaction fee\nreceived from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or\nredemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock\ncollaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services\nplatform. Citibank may have, or\nfrom time to time may develop,\nadditional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates. 17 BlackRock\nand its Affiliates may benefit\nfrom a Fund using a BlackRock\nindex by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for\nsuch indexes. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates are not obligated to\nlicense an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to\nuse a BlackRock index. The terms\nof a Fund\u2019s index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as\nfavorable as the terms offered to\nother licensees. The activities\nof BFA and its Affiliates and\ntheir respective directors,\nofficers or employees may give\nrise to other conflicts of\ninterest that could disadvantage\na Fund and its shareholders. BFA\nhas adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address\nthese potential conflicts of\ninterest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. Shareholder\nInformation Additional\nshareholder information,\nincluding how to buy and sell\nshares of the Funds, is available\nfree of charge by calling toll-\nfree 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and\nSelling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the\nprimary market and the secondary\nmarket. Primary market\ntransactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d\noccur only between the Funds and\nAuthorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in\nthe Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges, where they\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices,\nlike shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares\nmay also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on\nnon-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose\nany minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. Buying or selling Fund\nshares on an exchange or other\nsecondary market generally\ninvolves two types of costs that\nare common in securities\ntransactions. First, when buying\nor selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The\ncommission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant\nproportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread\nvaries over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity. Generally, the spread\nis smaller if a Fund has high\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity, and larger if a Fund\nhas lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is\noften the case for newly launched\nor smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread\nmay also be impacted by the\nliquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or\nother assets held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S.\nnational securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open\nfor trading Monday through Friday\nand are closed on weekends and\nthe following holidays (or the 18\ndays on which they are observed):\nNew Year\u2019s Day, Martin Luther\nKing, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day,\nGood Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day,\nLabor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. Investments in\nInvestment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing,\nregistered investment companies\nare permitted to invest in a Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to\ncertain terms and conditions set\nforth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an\ninvestment in an Acquired Fund, a\nregistered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter\ninto an agreement with the Trust.\nIf an Acquired Fund invests\nsignificantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance\non Rule 12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund\nwill not be permitted to rely on\nRule 12d1-4 and invest in the\nFund beyond the Section 12(d)(1)\nlimits. Any investment company\ninterested in purchasing shares\nof a Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1) should\ncontact BFA. Foreign investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund only up to the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to any applicable SEC no-\naction relief. Book Entry Shares\nof the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no\nstock certificates are issued.\nThe Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares\nof the Funds, or its nominee is\nthe record owner of, and holds\nlegal title to, all outstanding\nshares of the Funds. Investors\nowning Fund shares are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of Fund\nshares, you are not entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of\nstock certificates or to have\nshares registered in your name,\nand you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares.\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of Fund shares, you\nmust rely upon the procedures of\nDTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or\n\u201c street name \u201d form. 19 Share\nPrices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary\nmarket generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected\nby various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF\nshares and the securities or\nother assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic\nconditions. Determination of Net\nAsset Value The NAV of a Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each\nday that the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is\ndetermined as of the close of the\nNYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,\nbased on prices at the time of\nclosing. Any Fund assets or\nliabilities that are denominated\nin currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of a\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net\nassets ( i.e ., the value of its\ntotal assets, including the value\nof any underlying fund shares in\nwhich the Fund invests, less\ntotal liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of\nthe Fund, generally rounded to\nthe nearest cent. The value of a\nFund\u2019s assets and liabilities is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity\ninstruments for which market\nquotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which\nis generally determined using the\nlast reported official closing\nprice or, if a reported closing\nprice is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or\nmarket on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nthat are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs\nand closed-end funds that trade\non exchanges are valued at their\nmost recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are\nvalued using last available bid\nprices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated\nprices) supplied by the Funds\u2019\napproved independent third-party\npricing services, each in\naccordance with BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. Pricing\nservices may use matrix pricing\nor valuation models that utilize\ncertain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations\nwith 60 days or less remaining to\nmaturity unless BFA determines in\ngood faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value.\nGenerally, trading in certain\ninstruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market\ninstruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the 20\nclose of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such\ninstruments used in computing a\nFund\u2019s NAV are determined as of\nsuch times. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. Customized\nexchange-traded equity options\nmay be valued using a\nmathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market\ndata factors. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue a Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. Fair value represents\na good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability.\nIt is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of\nan asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. BFA may\nconclude that a market quotation\nis not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons; \u25a0 A market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or\nliability is thinly traded; \u25a0\nThere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation; or \u25a0 The\ntrading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities.\nValuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing may\nresult in prices that differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nfor which the particular fair\nvalues were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value\nprices and current market\nvaluations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in\nturn, result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its\nunderlying index. Dividends and\nDistributions General Policies. A\nFund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment\nincome, if any, at least once a\nyear. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if\nany, 21 generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for a Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid the\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on Fund\nshares are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof the shares. Dividend payments\nand other distributions are made\nthrough DTC participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFunds. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment\nProgram available to beneficial\nowners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact\ntheir broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation. Brokers may\nrequire beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If the program is\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole Fund shares\npurchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in a Fund. This\ninformation is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and\nlocal taxation on Fund\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares. Distributions that are\nattributable to interest from\nU.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from\ncertain state and local tax.\nConsult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in\nFund shares under all applicable\ntax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\na Fund will be taxed, including\npossible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when\nyou sell Fund shares. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund.\nThere is no guarantee that shares\nof a Fund will receive certain\nregulatory or accounting\ntreatment. Taxes on Fund\nDistributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information\nafter the end of each calendar\nyear setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital\ngains distributed to them by the\nFund during the prior year, if\nany. Likewise, the amount of tax-\nexempt income, if any, that a\nFund distributes will be\nreported. Such income must be\nreported on the shareholder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax return.\nIn general, distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. 22 Capital Gains.\nDistributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income or from\nnet tax-exempt income, if any),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of a Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gains, if any,\nare taxable to you as ordinary\nincome. Distributions by a Fund\nof net long-term capital gains,\nif any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain\ndividends) are taxable to you as\nlong-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have\nheld the Fund\u2019s shares. Long-term\ncapital gains and qualified\ndividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at\npreferential rates for non-\ncorporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may\napply depending on the type of\ncapital gains, such as Fund\ndistributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ),\nif any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of\nthe distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return\nof capital distribution generally\nwill not be taxable but will\nreduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher\ncapital gain or lower capital\nloss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are\nsold. Once a shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income, if any, are\ntaxable to you at long-term\ncapital gain rates. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income\nto you if they are attributable\nto qualified dividend income\nreceived by a Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\nstock issued by taxable U.S.\ncorporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided\nthat the Fund satisfies certain\nholding period requirements and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways. For\nthis purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any\nnon-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a\ncomprehensive income tax treaty\nwith the U.S., which includes an\nexchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to\nwhich the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities\nmarket. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company.\nDividends received by a Fund from\na RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent that such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from\na REIT, if any, and distributed\nto a shareholder generally will\nbe taxable to the shareholder as\nordinary income. However, for tax\nyears beginning after December\n31, 2017 and before January 1,\n2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified\nbusiness income \u201d deduction for\nnon-corporate U.S. shareholders\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary\nREIT dividends, reduced by\nallocable Fund expenses. 23 For a\ndividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the\ndividend must be received with\nrespect to a share of stock held\nwithout being hedged by the\nrelevant Fund, and with respect\nto a share of the Fund held\nwithout being hedged by you, for\n61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning at the date that is 60\ndays before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividend or,\nin the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day\nperiod beginning 90 days before\nsuch date. Fund distributions, to\nthe extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations,\nwill be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction for\nFund shareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nSubstitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends\npaid on securities lent out, if\nany, will not be qualified\ndividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on \u201c\nnet investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net\ngain, of U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding $200,000 (or\n$250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax.\nThe AMT is a separate U.S.\nfederal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular\nfederal income tax system but\neliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different\ntax rates and treats as taxable\ncertain types of income that are\nnontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on\ncertain \u201c private activity \u201d\nmunicipal bonds. If a taxpayer\u2019s\noverall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax\nliability, then the taxpayer owes\nthe regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the\nAMT liability and the regular\nincome tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market\ndiscount recognized on a bond,\nincluding a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary\nincome. A market discount bond is\na bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below\nredemption value or adjusted\nissue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the\nextent that a Fund does not\ninclude the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on\nthe Fund\u2019s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as\nordinary income rather than\ncapital gains to the extent of\nthe accrued market discount.\nDerivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in\nderivatives and other complex\ninstruments, and such investments\nmay be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules\ncould affect whether gains and\nlosses recognized by a Fund are\ntreated as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund\nor defer a Fund\u2019s ability to\nrecognize losses. In addition,\nthese rules may affect the\namount, timing or character of\nincome distributed to you by a\nFund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules.\n24 Non-U.S. Income Taxes\nDividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund\nwith respect to securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers may give rise\nto withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If, at the close of a\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of non-U.S.\nstocks or securities (generally,\nfor this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated\nas \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ), generally the\nFund may \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes,\nincluding withholding taxes, paid\nby the Fund. This means that you\nwould be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not\npass through non-U.S. taxes, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign\ntaxes that it incurs. Under\ncertain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign\ntaxes paid with respect to a\nprior year, the value of Fund\nshares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions\npassed through to shareholders\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s\nforeign taxes for the current\nyear could be reduced. If, at the\nclose of the year, more than 50%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including\ndepositary receipts (no matter\nwhere traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of\neach quarter, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of\nshares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its\nassets meet these requirements,\nthe Underlying Fund. For purposes\nof foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nNon-U.S. Shareholders If you are\nneither a resident nor a citizen\nof the U.S. or if you are a\nnon-U.S. entity (other than a\npass-through entity to the extent\nowned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which\ninclude distributions of net\nshort-term capital gains), if\nany, generally will be subject to\na 30% U.S. federal withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies. However, withholding tax\ngenerally will not apply to any\ngain or income realized by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder with respect\nto any distribution of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares.\nSeparately, a 30% withholding tax\nmay be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to\ncertain foreign entities, unless\nsuch entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive\nreporting and withholding\nrequirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the\nTreasury of U.S.-owned foreign\ninvestment accounts. 25 Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident\nor a citizen of the U.S. and you\nhave not provided a taxpayer\nidentification number or social\nsecurity number and made other\nrequired certifications, by law,\nbackup withholding at a 24% rate\nwill apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities\nLending If your shares of a Fund\nare loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends that are paid\nwhile the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend\nincome, and you may lose the\nability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund. Fund of Funds If a Fund\ninvests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned\nby the Underlying Fund, if any,\nwill be ordinary income when\ndistributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s\ncapital losses. To the extent\nsuch Fund is expected to invest\nin an Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nrealized losses on sales of\nshares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently\ndeferred as \u201c wash sales \u201d .\nCapital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not\noffset net capital gains of the\nFund. Taxes on the Sale of\nExchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the\nshares have been held for more\nthan one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares that have been held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as a short-term capital\ngain or loss. However, any\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nshares held for six months or\nless is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that\ncapital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any\nsuch capital gains, including\nfrom sales of Fund shares or from\ncapital gain dividends, are\nincluded in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior\nto being traded in the secondary\nmarket, Fund shares are \u201c created\n\u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other\nfinancial institutions) in block-\nsize Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created\nor redeemed only in Creation\nUnits, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds.\nEach Authorized Participant is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC and has entered into a\nwritten agreement with the Funds\u2019\nDistributor, an affiliate of BFA.\nThe agreement allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place\norders for the purchase and\nredemption of Creation Units.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without 26\n\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFunds. Creation transactions are\nsubject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant\nFund. Generally, there are three\ntransaction methods for creating\nand redeeming Fund shares: in-\nkind securities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ),\npartial cash and all cash. In-\nKind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a \u201c creation\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified\nnumber of Creation Units in\nreturn. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a \u201c redemption\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. Partial Cash .\nIn a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\ninto a Fund a creation basket and\na cash amount, including cash\nthat replaces a security or other\nasset in the creation basket, in\nexchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\nCreation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a\nredemption basket and a cash\namount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other\nasset in the redemption basket.\nAll Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund\nan amount of cash specified by\nthe Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a specified amount\nof cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may\ndiffer in composition, and\ncertain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation about custom baskets\nis provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in\ncreation and redemption\ntransactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table\nbelow. In certain circumstances,\nhowever, a Fund may use another\ntransaction method ( e.g. , an\nin-kind Fund may transact\npartially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Top 20      \u2713                               \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stocks ETF                                  \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations\nand redemptions occur are based\non the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is tendered in\nan acceptable form under the\nAuthorized Participant\nagreement. In the event of a\nsystem failure or other\ninterruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants,\ncreation and redemption orders\nmay not be executed according\nto a Fund\u2019s instructions or may\nnot be executed at all.\nAdditional information about\nthe creation and redemption of\nCreation Units (including the\ncut-off times for the receipt\nof creation and redemption\norders) is included in the\nFunds\u2019 SAI.\n\n27\n\nThe Funds do not impose\nrestrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions of\nFund shares directly with a\nFund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent\nor monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of\nFund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its\nshares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a\ndeadline for placing cash-\nrelated transactions no later\nthan the close of the primary\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However,\nthe Funds have taken certain\nmeasures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases\nand redemptions of Creation\nUnits and reserving the right\nto reject purchases of Creation\nUnits under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution\nto the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in\nFund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does\nnot involve the Funds directly,\nand such trading is unlikely to\ncause many of the harmful\neffects of frequent cash\npurchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. To the extent a\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends\nto comply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions\nthat would be exempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in\nRule 144A under the 1933 Act,\nwill not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible\nfor resale under Rule 144A.\nBecause Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an\nongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their\npart may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the\n1933 Act. Any determination of\nwhether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the\nrelevant facts and\ncircumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d\nbut are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to\nordinary secondary\ntransactions), and thus dealing\nwith shares that are part of an\n\u201c unsold allotment \u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus\ndelivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available\nonly with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding Householding is an\noption available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is\na method of delivery, based on\nthe preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a\nsingle 28 copy of certain\nshareholder documents can be\ndelivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if\nyou are interested in enrolling\nin householding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled\nin householding and wish to\nchange your householding\nstatus.

The Distributor\u2019s\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. BFA\nor its affiliates make payments\nto broker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together,\n\u201c intermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting\nsystems, data provision\nservices, or their making\nshares of the Funds available\nto their customers generally\nand in certain investment\nprograms. Such payments, which\nmay be significant to the\nintermediary, are not made by\nthe Funds. Rather, such\npayments are made by BFA or its\naffiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly\nor indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Funds. Payments of\nthis type are sometimes\nreferred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options\nit recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of\nservices provided, to its\ncustomers based on the payments\nor other financial incentives\nthe intermediary is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such\npayments or other financial\nincentives that are offered or\nmade to an intermediary create\nconflicts of interest between\nthe intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the\nintermediary to recommend the\nFunds over another investment.\nMore information regarding\nthese payments is contained in\nthe applicable SAI.

Trust currently consists of more than 345\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d\n), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track\nthe investment results of the specific\nbenchmark index identified in the Fund's\nProspectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nFund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c NYSE\nArca \u201d or the \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ), a\nnational securities exchange. Shares of the\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI), and, generally, in exchange for\nportfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as\ndefined in the Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI). Creation Units typically\nare a specified number of shares, generally\n20,000 or multiples thereof. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require that\ncreations and redemptions of shares are\neffected fully or partially in cash and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\ncash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks The Fund seeks to achieve\nits objective by investing primarily in\nsecurities issued by issuers that compose the\nUnderlying Index and in investments that\nprovide substantially similar exposure to\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\noperates as an index fund and is not actively\nmanaged. Adverse performance of a security in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not\nresult in the elimination of the security from\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Diversification\nStatus. The Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d A \u201c non-diversified \u201d fund is a\nfund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with\nregard to the percentage of its assets that\nmay be invested in the securities of a single\nissuer. The securities of a particular issuer\n(or securities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect the\nfund\u2019s performance or subject the fund\u2019s\nshares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by more diversified investment\ncompanies. The Fund intends to maintain the\nrequired level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Futures, Options on Futures and\nSecurities Options. Futures contracts, options\non futures and securities options may be used\nby the Fund to simulate investment in its\nUnderlying Index, to facilitate trading or to\nreduce transaction costs. The Fund may enter\ninto futures contracts and options on futures\nthat are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. The Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. The Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated\n\n2\n\nunder the Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ).\nBFA, with respect to the Fund, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the\nFund, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund\nwill be required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund. The potential for loss related to\nwriting call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts that are\ntraded on an exchange as a hedge against\nchanges in value of its portfolio securities\nor in anticipation of the purchase of\nsecurities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. The Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. The Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\nthe Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value\nof all securities loans of the Fund exceeds\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets\n\n3\n\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nThe Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that\nthe Fund engages in securities lending,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities lending agent for\nthe Fund, subject to the overall supervision\nof BFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the Fund\u2019s securities as agreed,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to participate in a\ncorporate action event may be impacted, or the\nFund may experience losses if the proceeds\nreceived from liquidating the collateral do\nnot at least equal the value of the loaned\nsecurity at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nThis latter event could trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. The Fund could lose\nmoney if its short-term investment of the\ncollateral declines in value over the period\nof the loan. Substitute payments received by\nthe Fund representing dividends paid on\nsecurities loaned out by the Fund will not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. BTC will\ntake into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nprogram. Substitute payments received on tax-\nexempt securities loaned out will not be tax-\nexempt income. There could also be changes in\nthe status of issuers under applicable laws\nand regulations, including tax regulations,\nthat may impact the regulatory or tax\ntreatment of loaned securities and could, for\nexample, result in a delay in the payment of\ndividend equivalent payments owed to the Fund\n(as permitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate\nsuch agreements, foreclose upon collateral,\nexercise other default rights or restrict\ntransfers of credit support in the event that\nthe counterparty and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to certain types of resolution or\ninsolvency proceedings. It is possible that\nthese requirements, as well as potential\nadditional government regulation and other\ndevelopments in the market, could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to terminate\nexisting securities lending agreements or to\nrealize amounts to be received under such\nagreements. Liquidity Risk Management. Rule\n22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the \u201c\nLiquidity Rule \u201d ) requires open-end funds,\nincluding exchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d )\nsuch as the Fund, to establish a liquidity\nrisk management program (the \u201c Liquidity\nProgram \u201d ) and enhance disclosures regarding\nfund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity\nRule, the Fund has implemented a Liquidity\nProgram, and the Board, including a majority\nof the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has\nappointed BFA as the administrator of the\nLiquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews the Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nand classifies each investment held by the\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid\n\n4\n\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c\nilliquid investment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule\ndefines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as the risk that\nthe Fund could not meet requests to redeem\nshares issued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment-\nspecific considerations under the Liquidity\nProgram. There are exclusions from certain\nportions of the liquidity risk management\nprogram requirements for \u201c in-kind \u201d ETFs, as\ndefined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent\nthat an investment is deemed to be an illiquid\ninvestment or a less liquid investment, the\nFund can expect to be exposed to greater\nliquidity risk. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. Derivative contracts,\nincluding, without limitation, swaps, currency\nforwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n( \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under\ncomparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable\nforwards and certain other derivatives traded\nin the OTC market are subject to variation\nmargin and initial margin requirements.\nImplementation of the margining and other\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding\nclearing, mandatory trading, reporting and\ndocumentation of swaps and other derivatives\nhave impacted and may continue to impact the\ncosts to the Fund of trading these instruments\nand, as a result, may affect returns to\ninvestors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into Derivatives Transactions (as\ndefined below) and certain other transactions\nnotwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g. , firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ).\n\n5\n\nRepurchase Agreements. A repurchase agreement\nis an instrument under which the purchaser (\ni.e. , the Fund) acquires a security and the\nseller agrees, at the time of the sale, to\nrepurchase the security at a mutually agreed-\nupon time and price, thereby determining the\nyield during the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by the Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nthe Fund, should it decide to utilize them.\nSuch risks are not unique to the Fund, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund\nseeks to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, the Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition the Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, the Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nBFA believes it will be advantageous to the\nFund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by the Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements and\nsimilar financing transactions ( e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nborrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation\non the issuance of senior securities in\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\nprovided that the Fund either (i) complies\nwith the 300% asset coverage ratio with\nrespect to such transactions and any other\nborrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats\nsuch transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives \u201d above.) Securities of Investment\nCompanies. The Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of other investment companies\n(including money market funds) to the extent\npermitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act,\nthe Fund\u2019s investment in registered investment\ncompanies is generally limited to, subject to\ncertain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of any one investment\ncompany; (ii) 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwith respect to any one investment company;\nand (iii) 10% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to investment companies in the\naggregate. Other investment companies in which\nthe Fund may invest can be expected to incur\nfees and expenses for operations, such as\ninvestment advisory and administration fees,\nwhich would be in addition to those incurred\nby the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by\nthe SEC staff, fees and expenses of money\nmarket funds used for cash collateral received\nin connection with loans of securities are not\ntreated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nwhich reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred by investing in\nother investment companies (as disclosed in\nthe Prospectus, as applicable).\n\n6\n\nShort-Term Instruments and Temporary\nInvestments. The Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d\n), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time deposits\nand other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S.\nbanks (including non-U.S. branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated, at the date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by\nMoody's \u00ae Investors Service, Inc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by\nFitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1 \u201d by Standard &\nPoor's \u00ae Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&P\nGlobal, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable\nquality as determined by BFA; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities ( e.g. ,\nbonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with the Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize the\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the Prospectus, provided they are\nconsistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. An investment in the Fund should\nbe made with an understanding that the value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Illiquid Investments Risk. The\nFund may not acquire any illiquid investment\nif, immediately after the acquisition, the\nFund would have invested more than 15% of its\nnet assets in illiquid investments. An\nilliquid investment is any investment that the\nFund reasonably expects cannot be sold or\ndisposed of in current market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less without\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. The liquidity of an investment\nwill be determined based on\n\n7\n\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Operational Risk. BFA and\nthe Fund's other service providers may\nexperience disruptions or operating errors\nsuch as processing errors or human errors,\ninadequate or failed internal or external\nprocesses, or systems or technology failures,\nthat could negatively impact the Fund. While\nservice providers are required to have\nappropriate operational risk management\npolicies and procedures, their methods of\noperational risk management may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s in the setting of priorities, the\npersonnel and resources available or the\neffectiveness of relevant controls. BFA,\nthrough its monitoring and oversight of\nservice providers, seeks to ensure that\nservice providers take appropriate precautions\nto avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to\ndisruptions and operating errors. However, it\nis not possible for BFA or the other Fund\nservice providers to identify all of the\noperational risks that may affect the Fund or\nto develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Risk of Derivatives. A\nderivative is a financial contract, the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, such as a\nsecurity, a commodity (such as gold or\nsilver), a currency or an index (a measure of\nvalue or rates, such as the S&P 500 \u00ae or the\nprime lending rate). The Fund may invest in\nfutures contracts, securities options and\nother derivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus the Fund\u2019s losses may\nbe greater if it invests in derivatives than\nif it invests only in conventional securities.\nDerivatives are also subject to counterparty\nrisk, which is the risk that the other party\nin the transaction will not fulfill its\ncontractual obligations. Derivatives generally\ninvolve the incurrence of leverage. When a\nderivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that the Fund holds or is committed\nto purchase, any loss generated by the\nderivative generally should be substantially\noffset by gains on the hedged investment, and\nvice versa. While hedging can reduce or\neliminate losses, it can also reduce or\neliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand the Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that the Fund's\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding of the\nrisks inherent in an investment in equity\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of\nstock markets may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nshares of the Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political,\n\n8\n\neconomic or banking crises. Common stocks may\nexperience extreme price volatility due to\nactions taken by particular investors or\ngroups of investors (for example, retail\ninvestors influenced by social media activity\nor other media coverage or significant \u201c short\n\u201d positions taken by institutional investors).\nHolders of common stocks incur more risks than\nholders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders\ngenerally have rights to receive payments from\nstock issuers that are inferior to the rights\nof creditors, or holders of debt obligations\nor preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt\nsecurities, which typically have a stated\nprincipal amount payable at maturity (the\nvalue of which, however, is subject to market\nfluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred\nstocks, which typically have a liquidation\npreference and which may have stated optional\nor mandatory redemption provisions, common\nstocks have neither a fixed principal amount\nnor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may,\nin times of distress or at their own\ndiscretion, decide to reduce or eliminate\ndividends, which may also cause their stock\nprice to decline. Although most of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index are listed\non a securities exchange, the principal\ntrading market for some of the securities may\nbe in the OTC market. The existence of a\nliquid trading market for certain securities\nmay depend on whether dealers will make a\nmarket in such securities. There can be no\nassurance that a market will be made or\nmaintained or that any such market will be or\nremain liquid. The price at which securities\nmay be sold and the value of the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill be adversely affected if trading markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities are\nlimited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are\nwide. Risk of Futures and Options on Futures\nTransactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit the risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to the Underlying Index\nif the index underlying the futures contract\ndiffers from the Underlying Index. There is\nalso the risk of loss of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom\nthe Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option. The purchase of put or\ncall options will be based upon predictions by\nBFA as to anticipated trends, which\npredictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin.\n\n9\n\nRisk of Swap Agreements. The risk of loss with\nrespect to swaps is generally limited to the\nnet amount of payments that the Fund is\ncontractually obligated to make. Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nparties will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect the Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , the Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). The Fund\nis required to post and collect variation\nmargin and initial margin (comprised of\nspecified liquid securities subject to\nhaircuts) in connection with trading of OTC\nswaps. These requirements may raise the costs\nfor the Fund\u2019s investment in swaps. Tracking\nError Risk. The Fund may be subject to\ntracking error, which is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Index,\npricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or distributions\npaid to the Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or the costs\nto the Fund of complying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of increased\nmarket volatility or other unusual market\nconditions. Tracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the Underlying Index does not. Tracking\nerror may occur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe Underlying Index and determining the\nFund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is introduced by an\nindex provider into an index tracked by a\nFund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such\nissuer\u2019s securities to identify and screen for\noutlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or\nunusual price growth that does not appear to\nbe supported by publicly available information\non the business and assets of the issuer,\nunusual or significant short interest or\nlending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such Fund\nwill be subject to increased tracking error\ndue to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. The application of the abovementioned\nanalysis and screening to a Fund and its\nUnderlying Index is in the sole discretion of\nBFA and its affiliates (without any\nguarantees). The analysis and screening may\nnot exclude any or all high risk securities\nfrom an Underlying Index or a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nthe Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Consumer Discretionary\nSector. Companies engaged in the design,\nproduction or distribution of products or\nservices for the consumer discretionary sector\n(including, without limitation, television and\nradio broadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and\nsports arenas, camping and recreational\nequipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-\nrelated services, automobiles, hotels and\nmotels, and fast food and other restaurants)\nare subject to the risk that their products or\nservices may become obsolete quickly. The\nsuccess of these companies can depend heavily\non disposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector also may be subject to\nrisks pertaining to the supply of, demand for\nand prices of raw materials. The prices of raw\nmaterials fluctuate in response to\n\n10\n\na number of factors, including, without\nlimitation, changes in government agricultural\nsupport programs, exchange rates, import and\nexport controls, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in the Fund's\nportfolio becomes distressed, the Fund could\nlose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of the Fund. Risk of Investing in\nthe Financials Sector. Companies in the\nfinancials sector include small, regional and\nmoney center banks, securities brokerage\nfirms, asset management companies, savings\nbanks and thrift institutions, specialty\nfinance companies ( e.g. , credit card,\nmortgage providers), insurance and insurance\nbrokerage firms, consumer finance firms,\nfinancial conglomerates and foreign banking\nand financial companies. Most financial\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which the Fund\ninvests, including legislation in many\ncountries that may increase government\nregulation, repatriation and other\nintervention. The impact of governmental\nintervention and legislative changes on any\nindividual financial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general\n\n11\n\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers. In\naddition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\n\n12\n\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in Technology Companies. Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources\nand personnel. These companies may face rapid\nproduct obsolescence as well as unexpected\nrisks and costs related to new product\nintroduction and technological developments,\nsuch as artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies may be\nadversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Proxy Voting Policy\nFor the Fund, the Board has delegated the\nvoting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s securities to\nBFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy Voting\nPolicy, and BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund. Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies, BFA will vote proxies related to\nFund securities in the best interests of the\nFund and its shareholders. From time to time,\na vote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales and client responsibilities. In\naddition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure\nthat all engagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ending\nJune 30 will be available: (i) without charge,\nupon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle\n\n13\n\npurchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities the Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that the\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling the Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for the\nFund as needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndex A description of the Underlying Index is\nprovided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and\n\n14\n\nother instruments in the underlying index, and\nany updates to the methodology. From time to\ntime, BFA or its affiliates may also provide\ninput relating to possible methodology changes\nof such underlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe S&P Indexes Component Selection Criteria\nfor Domestic Indexes. S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC\u2019s ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ) various Index Committees\nare responsible for the overall management of\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC's indices ( \u201c S&P\nDJI Indices \u201d ). Issuers ( i.e ., the \u201c\ncomponents \u201d ) selected for the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s Financial Services LLC ( \u201c S&P \u201d ) U.S.\nindexes represent a broad range of industry\nsegments within the U.S. economy. The starting\nuniverse of publicly traded U.S. issuers\nclassified by the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) is screened\nto eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited\npartnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding\nissuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink\nsheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs\nand tracking stocks. REITs, except for\nmortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in\nthe Indexes. The stock of each constituent\nmust trade on either the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ), the NYSE Amex Equities\nor on Nasdaq. Additionally, only one share\nclass per constituent will be included in an\nIndex. The share class is selected by SPDJI\nand is generally defined as the largest, most\nliquid share class. Issuers with multiple\nshare classes will have the classes combined\nfor purposes of calculation of market\ncapitalization. The following criteria are\nthen analyzed to determine an issuer\u2019s\neligibility for inclusion in the S&P Indexes:\n(i) ownership of an issuer\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock, in order to screen out closely\nheld issuers; (ii) trading volume of an\nissuer\u2019s shares, in order to ensure ample\nliquidity and efficient share pricing; and\n(iii) the financial and operating condition of\nan issuer. The S&P DJI\u2019s Indices are\ncapitalization-weighted, based on the\nfollowing formula: number of outstanding\nshares of a constituent (as determined by the\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization using\nSPDJI\u2019s methodology) multiplied by the\nconstituent\u2019s share price. Issuers with float-\nadjusted market capitalizations below certain\nthresholds are not eligible for the Indexes.\nIn addition, the market capitalization of an\nissuer eligible for inclusion typically must\nbe greater than the Index\u2019s minimum market\ncapitalization at the time it is being\nconsidered for Index inclusion. The market\ncapitalizations of an Index\u2019s components are\nadjusted to reflect changes in capitalization\nresulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock\nrights, substitutions and other capital\nevents. The market capitalizations of an\nIndex\u2019s constituent are adjusted for all\nstrategic holdings, including private,\ncorporate, and government holdings. Issue\nChanges. General oversight responsibility for\nthe S&P DJI Indices, including overall policy\nguidelines and methodology, is handled by the\nS&P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of\ncomponent investments, including additions and\ndeletions to these investments, is the\nresponsibility of separate regional index\ncommittees composed of S&P staff specialized\nin the various regional equity markets and, in\nsome cases, with the assistance of local stock\nexchanges. Public announcements of index\nchanges as the result of committee decisions\nwill generally be made two business days in\nadvance of the anticipated effective date\nwhenever possible, although for exceptional\ncorporate events announcements may be made\nearlier. Index Maintenance. Maintaining the\nS&P DJI Indices includes monitoring and\ncompleting the adjustments for issuer\nadditions and deletions, share changes, stock\nsplits, stock dividends, and stock price\nadjustments due to restructuring and spin-\noffs. An issuer will be removed from the S&P\nDJI Indices as a result of\nmergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or\nrestructuring. An issuer is removed from the\nrelevant index as close as possible to the\nactual date on which the event occurred. An\nissuer can be removed from an index because it\nno longer meets current criteria for inclusion\nand/or is no longer representative of its\nindustry group. All replacement issuers are\nselected based on the above component section\ncriteria. When calculating index weights,\nindividual components shares held by\ngovernments, corporations, strategic partners,\nor other control groups are excluded from the\nissuer\u2019s shares outstanding. Shares owned by\nother issuers are also excluded regardless of\nwhether they are index components. In\ncountries with regulated environments, where a\nforeign investment limit exists at the sector\nor issuer level, the constituent\u2019s weight will\nreflect either the foreign investment limit or\nthe percentage float, whichever is the more\nrestrictive. Each issuer\u2019s financial\nstatements will be used to update the major\nshareholders\u2019 ownership. However, during the\ncourse of the year, SPDJI also monitors each\nissuer\u2019s Investable Weight Factor ( \u201c IWF \u201d )\nwhich is SPDJI\u2019s term for the mathematical\nfloat factor used to calculate the float\nadjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a\nmajor corporate action ( i.e. , privatization,\nmerger, takeover, or share offering) and the\nchange equal to or greater than 5%, a float\nadjustment will be implemented as soon as\nreasonably possible.\n\n15\n\nChanges in the number of shares outstanding\ndriven by corporate events such as stock\ndividends, splits, and rights issues will be\nadjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5%\nor greater are implemented when they occur.\nShare changes of less than 5% are only updated\non a quarterly basis on the Friday near the\nend of the calendar quarter. Generally, index\nchanges due to rebalancing are announced two\ndays before the effective date by way of a\nnews release posted on www.us.spindices.com.\nIndex Availability. The S&P Indexes are\ncalculated continuously and are available from\nmajor data vendors. Exchange Rates. SPDJI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. Prior to\nJanuary 31, 2013, SPDJI used the currency\nexchange (FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m.\nEastern time. In case World Markets/Reuters\ndoes not provide rates for specific markets on\ngiven days (for example, Christmas Day and New\nYear\u2019s Day), the previous business day\u2019s rates\nare normally used. SPDJI independently\nmonitors the exchange rates on all its\nindexes. SPDJI may under exceptional\ncircumstances elect to use alternative sources\nof exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters\nrates are not available, or if SPDJI\ndetermines that the World Markets/Reuters\nrates are not reflective of market\ncircumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. S&P 500 Top 20 Select Index \u00ae\nNumber of Components: approximately 21 Index\nDescription. The S&P 500 Top 20 Select Index \u00ae\nconsists of 20 of the largest U.S. companies\nby float-adjusted market capitalization within\nthe S&P 500 \u00ae Index. For capping purposes, at\neach quarterly rebalance in March, June,\nSeptember, and December, the weight of any\nsingle issuer will not exceed 22.5% of the\nindex; and the aggregate weight of issuers\nwith individual weights exceeding 4.5% will\nnot exceed 48% of the index. SPDJI targets 20\ncompanies to be included in the S&P 500 Top 20\nSelect Index \u00ae and replaces any removed\ncompany even if outside the normal quarterly\nrebalance. Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act.\n\n16\n\nNotations Regarding the Fund's Fundamental\nInvestment Policies The following notations\nare not considered to be part of the Fund\u2019s\nfundamental investment policies and are\nsubject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of industries\nconstitutes concentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities; securities of\nstate, territory, possession or municipal\ngovernments and their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\n\n17\n\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies The Fund\nhas adopted a non-fundamental policy not to\nmake short sales of securities or maintain a\nshort position, except to the extent permitted\nby the Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended\nfrom time to time, and applicable law. The\nFund has adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act to invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of the value of\nits net assets, plus the amount of any\nborrowings for investment purposes, in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nor in depositary receipts representing\ncomponent securities in its Underlying Index.\nThe Fund also has adopted a policy to provide\nits shareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 prior\nwritten notice of any change in such policy.\nIf, subsequent to an investment, the 80%\nrequirement is no longer met, the Fund\u2019s\nfuture investments will be made in a manner\nthat will bring the Fund into compliance with\nthis policy. The Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to purchase securities\nof other investment companies, except to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct. As a matter of policy, however, the Fund\nwill not purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u201c fund of funds \u201d\nprovisions) of the Investment Company Act, at\nany time the Fund has knowledge that its\nshares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder the Fund's fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of the Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange.\n\n18\n\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Fund, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers. Each Trustee serves\nuntil he or she resigns, is removed, dies,\nretires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer\nshall hold office until his or her successor\nis elected and qualifies or until his or her\ndeath, resignation or removal. Trustees who\nare not \u201c interested persons \u201d (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nThe Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 414 funds\nas of October 21, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12\nThrogmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United\nKingdom. The Board has designated John E.\nKerrigan as its Independent Board Chair.\nAdditional information about the Fund's\nTrustees and officers may be found in this\nSAI, which is available without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737).

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n26\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund.

Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\n32\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding the Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or establishment\nof a short position by the Fund may impair the\nprice of the same security sold short by (and\ntherefore benefit) BlackRock or its other\naccounts or funds, and the purchase of a\nsecurity or covering of a short position in a\nsecurity by the Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds. In addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, the Fund may invest its assets\nin other funds advised by BlackRock, including\nfunds that are managed by one or more of the\nsame portfolio managers, which could result in\nconflicts of interest relating to asset\nallocation, timing of Fund purchases and\nsales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Fund, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such\n\n33\n\nother business units or entities or their\nclients and such obligations to other business\nunits or entities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund or BlackRock. Subject\nto applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection with their service\nto the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Fund or its shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Fund or its\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program,\n\n34\n\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Fund will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Fund. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Fund will not\nbe charged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order. Subject to applicable\nlaw, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such\n\n35\n\nother BlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Fund and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Fund's assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Fund. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\nthe Fund may be executed on MEMX if third\nparty brokers select MEMX as the appropriate\nvenue for execution of orders placed by\nBlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In\naddition, transactions in Fund shares may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for the\nexecution of such orders. BlackRock has\nadopted policies and procedures designed to\nprevent conflicts of interest from influencing\nproxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf\nof advisory clients, including the Fund, and\nto help ensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\nthe Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material\n\n36\n\nnon-public information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit the Fund's flexibility\nin purchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Fund. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and\n\n37\n\nothers who normally come into possession of\ninformation regarding the Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the Fund),\nmay limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset.\n\n38\n\nBlackRock may not serve as an Authorized\nParticipant in the creation and redemption of\niShares ETFs. Under an ETF Services Agreement,\nthe Fund has retained BRIL, an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units of\nthe Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard transaction\nfee received from Authorized Participants on\neach creation or redemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the ETF Services\nprovided. BlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and development of\nthe ETF Services platform. Citibank may have,\nor from time to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Fund may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with cash\nsubstitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Fund in\ndetermining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Fund related to creation and redemption\nactivity, BlackRock may have incentives to\nimprove Fund performance through the\ncollection of these fees. As these charges are\nbased on estimates, where the charges exceed\nactual transaction- related costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by the Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Fund may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof its investment strategy. Index based funds\nthat seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s\nreceipt of fees from a service provider in\nconnection with the use of systems provided by\nBlackRock may create an incentive for\nBlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider.\n\n39\n\nIn recognition of a BlackRock client\u2019s overall\nrelationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may\noffer special pricing arrangements for certain\nservices provided by BlackRock. Any such\nspecial pricing arrangements will not apply to\nthe client\u2019s investment in the Fund. Present\nand future activities of BlackRock (including\nBFA), its directors, officers and employees,\nin addition to those described in this\nsection, may give rise to additional conflicts\nof interest. Investment Advisory,\nAdministrative and Distribution Services\nInvestment Adviser. BFA serves as investment\nadviser to the Fund pursuant to an investment\nadvisory agreement between the Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, and BFA. BFA is a\nCalifornia corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an\ninvestment adviser under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to\nthe supervision of the Board and in conformity\nwith the stated investment policies of the\nFund, manages and administers the Trust and\nthe investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee by the Fund, based on a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, at an annual\nrate of 0.20%. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act). The investment\nadvisory agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by BFA and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act). Portfolio\nManagers. As of August 31, 2024, the\nindividuals named as Portfolio Managers in the\nFund's Prospectus were also primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nother iShares funds and certain other types of\nportfolios and/or accounts as follows:\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          349  $2,417,260,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n                                              \n40\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of Accounts     Number  Total Assets  \n  Other Pooled               0  N/A           \n  Investment Vehicles                         \n  Other Accounts             0  N/A           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          317  $2,383,128,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment           84     $9,362,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       11     $2,789,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul Whitehead                              \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          385  $2,555,342,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment          323  $1,103,725,000,0\u2026  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts      134   $737,653,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of August 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n41\n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $3,129,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of October 21, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of October 21, 2024,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities.\n\n42\n\nAdministrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d )\nserves as administrator, custodian and\ntransfer agent for the Fund under the Master\nServices Agreement (the \u201c Master Services\nAgreement \u201d ). JPMorgan\u2019s principal address is\n383 Madison Avenue, 11 th Floor, New York, NY\n10179. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan provides\nnecessary administrative, tax and accounting\nand financial reporting services for the\nmaintenance and operations of the Trust and\nthe Fund. In addition, JPMorgan makes\navailable the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan maintains,\nin separate accounts, cash, securities and\nother assets of the Trust and the Fund, keeps\nall necessary accounts and records and\nprovides other services. JPMorgan is required,\nupon the order of the Trust, to deliver\nsecurities held by JPMorgan and to make\npayments for securities purchased by the Trust\nfor the Fund. JPMorgan is authorized to\nappoint certain foreign custodians or foreign\ncustody managers for Fund investments outside\nthe U.S. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan acts as a\ntransfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from\nits management fee. BFA pays the compensation\nbecause it has agreed to pay these operating\nexpenses under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement as described therein. Distributor.\nThe Distributor's principal address is 50\nHudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Fund\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund retains a\nportion of the securities lending income and\nremits the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending. The\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Fund is categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of the Fund\u2019s asset class\ncategory (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC.\n\n43\n\nPursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement: (i) domestic equity funds,\nsuch as the Fund, retain 81% of securities\nlending income (which excludes collateral\ninvestment fees) and (ii) this amount could\nnever be less than 70% of the sum of\nsecurities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable domestic equity fund, pursuant\nto the current Securities Lending Agency\nAgreement, will receive for the remainder of\nthat calendar year securities lending income\nas follows: Domestic Equity Funds (i) 81% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees); and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. Because the Fund is newly\nlaunched, no services have been provided by\nBTC as the Fund\u2019s securities lending agent,\nand the Fund had no income and\nfees/compensation related to securities\nlending activities for the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2024. Payments by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c BFA\nEntities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Fund.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Fund, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\n\n44\n\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Cetera Financial Group, Inc., Charles\nSchwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre\nAG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey\nWright and Associates, LLC, Dynasty Financial\nPartners LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC,\nEnvestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro USA\nSecurities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern\nMutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion\nPortfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public\nHoldings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs. Determination of Net Asset\nValue Valuation of Shares. The NAV for the\nFund is generally calculated as of the close\nof regular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by the Fund is\nas follows:\n\n45\n\nEquity Investments. Equity securities traded\non a recognized securities exchange ( e.g. ,\nNYSE), on separate trading boards of a\nsecurities exchange or through a market system\nthat provides contemporaneous transaction\npricing information (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d )\nare valued using information obtained via\nindependent pricing services, generally at the\nclosing price or, if an Exchange closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on\nthat Exchange prior to the time as of which\nthe assets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by the Fund on a day on which\nthe Fund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. The\nFund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\n\n46\n\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill\n\n47\n\nin positioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Fund will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor execution could be obtained by using a\nbroker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Fund will not deal with affiliated persons\nand affiliated persons of such affiliated\npersons in connection with such transactions.\nThe Fund will not purchase securities during\nthe existence of any underwriting or selling\ngroup relating to such securities of which\nBFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except\npursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFund are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Fund does not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\n\n48\n\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFund or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could\n\n49\n\nbe beneficial to the Fund. Transactions\neffected by BFA or the other Affiliates on\nbehalf of more than one of its clients during\nthe same period may increase the demand for\nsecurities being purchased or the supply of\nsecurities being sold, causing an adverse\neffect on price. The trader will give the\nbunched order to the broker-dealer that the\ntrader has identified as being able to provide\nthe best execution of the order. Orders for\npurchase or sale of securities will be placed\nwithin a reasonable amount of time of the\norder receipt and bunched orders will be kept\nbunched only long enough to execute the order.\nThe Fund's purchase and sale orders for\nsecurities may be combined with those of other\ninvestment companies, clients or accounts that\nBlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Fund and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff.\n\n50\n\nIn accordance with the Trust's current\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust (the \u201c\nDeclaration of Trust \u201d ), the Board may,\nwithout shareholder approval (unless such\nshareholder approval is required by the\nDeclaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\n\n51\n\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange closes earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced earlier in the day. The following table\nsets forth the number of shares of the Fund\nthat constitute a Creation Unit for the Fund\nand the approximate value of such Creation\nUnit as of October 21, 2024:\n                                              \n  Shares PerCreation        ApproximateValue  \n  Unit                       PerCreationUnit  \n                                     (U.S.$)  \n  20,000                            $500,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities is designed to\ngenerate performance that has a\n\n52\n\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject\nto any adjustments as described below, to\npurchases of Creation Units of shares of the\nFund until such time as the next-announced\nFund Deposit is made available. The \u201c Cash\nComponent \u201d is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d\nwhich is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing the Creation Unit. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of the Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for the Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units (an \u201c Authorized Participant\n\u201d ). Such Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of such Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and on behalf of itself\nor any investor on whose behalf it will act,\nto certain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component.\n\n53\n\nInvestors who are not Authorized Participants\nmust make appropriate arrangements with an\nAuthorized Participant. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not be\na DTC Participant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of the Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order.\n\n54\n\nThe Fund reserves the right to reject or\nrevoke a creation order transmitted to it by\nthe Distributor or its agent provided that a\nrejection or revocation of a creation order\ndoes not violate Rule 6c-11 under the\nInvestment Company Act. For example, the Fund\nmay reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent if (i) the order is not in proper form;\n(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nshares ordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding shares of the Fund;\n(iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not\nconform to the identity and number of shares\nspecified, as described above; (iv) acceptance\nof the Deposit Securities is not legally\nrequired or would, in the opinion of counsel,\nbe unlawful; or (v) circumstances outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Distributor or its\nagent and BFA make it impracticable to process\npurchase orders. The Distributor or its agent\nshall notify a prospective purchaser of a\nCreation Unit and/or the Authorized\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Fund,\nJPMorgan, the sub-custodian and the\nDistributor or its agent are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the Fund of the Deposit Securities\nand the payment of the Cash Component have\nbeen completed. When the sub-custodian has\nconfirmed to the custodian that the securities\nincluded in the Fund Deposit (or the cash\nvalue thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-\ncustodians, the Distributor or its agent and\nBFA shall be notified of such delivery and the\nFund will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Unit. Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally issued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e. ,\none Business Day after trade date). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle Creation Unit\ntransactions on a different basis if necessary\nor appropriate under the circumstances and\ncompliant with applicable law. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant\nAgreement with the Distributor, the Fund will\nissue Creation Units to such Authorized\nParticipant, notwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Fund. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby the Fund or its custodian on the\ncontractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by the\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform ETF Services. BRIL will receive\nfrom an Authorized Participant a standard\ntransaction fee on each creation order, which\nconsists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF\nServices (the \u201c ETF Servicing Fee \u201d ) and (2)\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts charged by the Fund custodian in\nconnection with the issuance of Creation Units\nfor such creation order ( \u201c Custody\nTransaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is entitled to\nretain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the\nETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will\nreimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the\nFund custodian according to the amounts\ninvoiced by such custodian. The ETF Servicing\nFee is a flat fee per order regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units being purchased,\nwhich amount will vary among different Funds\nbased on a number of factors, including the\ncomplexity of the order and the types of\nsecurities or instruments included in a Fund\u2019s\nCreation Basket, among other variables. The\nactual Custody Transaction Costs vary per\norder based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets and settlement locations\nassociated with the issuance of a Creation\nUnit. The following table sets forth the\nactual creation transaction fee that was\ncharged on October 11, 2024. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\ncreation order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below.\n\n55\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses for\nthe Fund and protect against possible\nshareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, the Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's actual creation transaction fee as\nof October 11, 2024 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $176.25               3.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. Redemption of Creation Units.\nShares of the Fund may be redeemed by\nAuthorized Participants only in Creation Units\nat their NAV next determined after receipt of\na redemption request in proper form by the\nDistributor or its agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. The Fund will not redeem shares\nin amounts less than Creation Units. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. The Fund generally redeems\nCreation Units for Fund Securities (as defined\nbelow). Please see the Cash Redemption Method\nsection below and the following discussion\nsummarizing the in-kind method for further\ninformation on redeeming Creation Units of the\nFund. The Fund publishes the designated\nportfolio of securities (including any portion\nof such securities for which cash may be\nsubstituted) that will be applicable to\nredemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Fund\nSecurities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ), and\nan amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for the\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of\n\n56\n\ncash paid out in such cases will be equivalent\nto the value of the substituted security\nlisted as a Fund Security. In the event that\nthe Fund Securities have a value greater than\nthe NAV of the shares, a compensating cash\npayment equal to the difference is required to\nbe made by or through an Authorized\nParticipant by the redeeming shareholder. The\nFund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities, but the Fund reserves the right to\nutilize a cash option for redemption of\nCreation Units. The Fund may, in its sole\ndiscretion, provide such redeeming Authorized\nParticipant a portfolio of securities that\ndiffers from the exact composition of the Fund\nSecurities, but does not differ in NAV. The\nRedemption Basket may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Fund Securities portion of the\nRedemption Basket through systematically\nrounding. The rounding methodology allows\nposition sizes of securities in the Fund\nSecurities to be \u201c rounded up, \u201d while\nlimiting the maximum allowed percentage change\nin weight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Redemption Basket. Redemption\nBaskets may also be modified to position a\nfund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. Cash\nRedemption Method. Although the Trust does not\ngenerally permit partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units of its funds,\nwhen partial or full cash redemptions of\nCreation Units are available or specified for\nthe Fund, they will be effected in essentially\nthe same manner as in-kind redemptions\nthereof. In the case of partial or full cash\nredemption, the Authorized Participant\nreceives the cash equivalent of the Fund\nSecurities it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\nETF Services. BRIL will receive from an\nAuthorized Participant a standard transaction\nfee on each redemption order, which consists\nof (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody\nTransaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain\nthe ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF\nServices Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse\nany Custody Transaction Costs to the Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being redeemed, which amount\nwill vary among different Funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a Fund\u2019s Redemption\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets,\nand settlement locations associated with the\nredemption of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth the actual standard\nredemption transaction fee that was charged on\nOctober 11, 2024. The actual fee that was or\nwould have been charged to an Authorized\nParticipant in connection with a redemption\norder will vary over time depending on the\nfactors discussed above, and may be higher\nthan the fee set forth below. In order to\ndefray transaction expenses for the Fund and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nif a redemption transaction consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, the Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from the Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund's actual redemption transaction\nfee as of October 11, 2024 and maximum\nadditional charge (as described above):\n\n57\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $176.25               2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. Placement of\nRedemption Orders. Redemption requests for\nCreation Units of the Fund must be submitted\nto the Distributor or its agent by or through\nan Authorized Participant. An Authorized\nParticipant must submit an irrevocable request\nto redeem shares of the Fund generally before\n4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in\norder to receive that day's NAV. On days when\nthe Listing Exchange closes earlier than\nnormal, the Fund may require orders to redeem\nCreation Units to be placed earlier that day.\nInvestors, other than Authorized Participants,\nare responsible for making arrangements for a\nredemption request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. The\nAuthorized Participant must transmit the\nrequest for redemption in the form required by\nthe Fund to the Distributor or its agent in\naccordance with procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nshould be aware that their particular broker\nmay not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\nrequests to redeem Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant who has executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\none Business Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle redemption\ntransactions on a different basis, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant's agreement with the\nDistributor or its agent, in the event an\nAuthorized Participant has submitted a\nredemption request in proper form but is\nunable to transfer all or part of the Creation\nUnit to be redeemed to the Fund, at or prior\nto the time specified by the Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby JPMorgan and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of JPMorgan and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be\n\n58\n\npayable by the Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant Agreement permits the\nFund to acquire shares of the Fund at any time\nand subjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. The right of redemption may\nbe suspended or the date of payment postponed\nwith respect to the Fund: (i) for any period\nduring which the Listing Exchange is closed\n(other than customary weekend and holiday\nclosings); (ii) for any period during which\ntrading on the Listing Exchange is suspended\nor restricted; (iii) for any period during\nwhich an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. The Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\n\n59\n\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. The Fund will be subject to\nincome tax at regular corporate rates on any\ntaxable income or gains that it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders. If the Fund\nfails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC\nor fails to meet the distribution requirement,\nall of its taxable income will be subject to\ntax at regular corporate income tax rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and such distributions generally\nwill be taxable to shareholders as ordinary\ndividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. Net\nCapital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital loss\ncarryforwards may be applied against any net\nrealized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\n\n60\n\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Long-term\ncapital gains are eligible for taxation at a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts. If\nan individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the\n\n61\n\nsum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions. Sales\nof Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of shares\nof the Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by the Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an\norder for a purchase of shares of the Fund if\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have\na basis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. The Fund\u2019s transactions\nin zero coupon securities, non-U.S.\ncurrencies, forward contracts, options and\nfutures contracts (including options and\nfutures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to\nthe extent permitted, will be subject to\nspecial provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to \u201c\nhedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\n\n62\n\ntaxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions,\nwill make the appropriate tax elections and\nwill make the appropriate entries in its books\nand records when it acquires any zero coupon\nsecurity, non-U.S. currency, forward contract,\noption, futures contract or hedged investment\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand prevent disqualification of the Fund as a\nRIC. The Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c\nSection 1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated\nfutures contracts, most non-U.S. currency\nforward contracts traded in the interbank\nmarket and options on most security indexes,\nare subject to special tax rules. All Section\n1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of\nits taxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, the Fund may\nmake or receive periodic net payments. The\nFund may also make or receive a payment when a\nswap is terminated prior to maturity through\nan assignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, the Fund may be\nrequired to currently recognize income or loss\nwith respect to future payments on such swaps\nor may elect under certain circumstances to\nmark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but\nnot with Hong Kong, which is treated as a\nseparate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes),\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by the\nFund for securities lent out by the Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom the Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or the Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income.\n\n63\n\nCorporate Dividends Received Deduction.\nDividends paid by the Fund that are\nattributable to dividends received by the Fund\nfrom U.S. corporations may qualify for the\nU.S. federal dividends received deduction for\ncorporations. A 46-day minimum holding period\nduring the 90-day period that begins 45 days\nprior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum\nholding period during the 180 period beginning\n90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at both the Fund and\nshareholder level, for a dividend to be\neligible for the dividends received deduction.\nRestrictions may apply if indebtedness,\nincluding a short sale, is attributable to the\ninvestment. Excess Inclusion Income. Under\ncurrent law, the Fund serves to block\nunrelated business taxable income ( \u201c UBTI \u201d )\nfrom being realized by its tax-exempt\nshareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\ntax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI by\nvirtue of its investment in the Fund if shares\nin the Fund constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder\nwithin the meaning of Section 514(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Certain types of income\nreceived by the Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt such as individual retirement\naccounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans,\npension plans and certain charitable entities;\n(ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable\ndeductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be\neligible for reduced U.S. withholding for\nnon-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty\ncountries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be\nsubject to tax if certain \u201c disqualified\norganizations, \u201d as defined by the Internal\nRevenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a\ncharitable remainder annuity trust or a\ncharitable remainder unitrust (each as defined\nin Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code)\nhas UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax\non the UBTI is imposed on the trust. The Fund\ntries to avoid investing in REITs that are\nexpected to generate excess inclusion income,\nbut the Fund may not always be successful in\ndoing so. Because information about a REIT\u2019s\ninvestments may be inadequate or inaccurate,\nor because a REIT may change its investment\nprogram, the Fund may not be successful in\navoiding the consequences described above.\nAvoidance of investments in REITs that\ngenerate excess inclusion income may require\nthe Fund to forego otherwise attractive\ninvestment opportunities. Non-U.S.\nInvestments. Under Section 988 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime the Fund accrues income or receivables or\nexpenses or other liabilities denominated in a\nnon-U.S. currency and the time the Fund\nactually collects such income or pays such\nliabilities are generally treated as ordinary\nincome or ordinary loss. In general, gains\n(and losses) realized on debt instruments will\nbe treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to\nthe extent attributable to changes in exchange\nrates between the U.S. dollar and the\ncurrencies in which the instruments are\ndenominated. Similarly, gains or losses on\nnon-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts and certain non-U.S. currency\noptions or futures contracts denominated in\nnon-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable\nto fluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless the\nFund were to elect otherwise. The Fund may be\nsubject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The Fund, if permitted to do so,\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its investors\nthe amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by\nthe Fund provided that the Fund held the\nsecurity on the dividend settlement date and\nfor at least 15 additional days immediately\nbefore and/or thereafter, with the result that\neach investor with respect to shares of the\nFund held for a minimum 16-day holding period\nat the time of deemed distribution will (i)\ninclude in gross income, even though not\nactually received, the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes, and\n(ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S.\ntaxable income, but only for investors who\nitemize their deductions on their personal tax\nreturns) or credit (in calculating U.S.\nfederal income tax) the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes.\nWithholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.\nsecurities while such securities are lent out\nby the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax\ncredit pass through. Taxes not \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d for tax purposes will not be\navailable to shareholders for foreign tax\ncredit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in\nthe Fund in a year that the Fund elects to \u201c\npass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes may be\ntreated as receiving additional dividend\nincome subject to U.S. withholding tax. A\nnon-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by the\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\n\n64\n\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf the Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements,\nthe Fund might be required to include in\nincome each year a portion of the ordinary\nearnings and net capital gains of the\nqualified electing fund, even if not\ndistributed to the Fund, and such amounts\nwould be subject to the 90% and excise tax\ndistribution requirements described above. In\norder to make this election, the Fund would be\nrequired to obtain certain annual information\nfrom the PFICs in which it invests, which may\nbe difficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-\nmarket election that would result in the Fund\nbeing treated as if it had sold and\nrepurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each\nyear. In such case, the Fund would report any\nsuch gains as ordinary income and would deduct\nany such losses as ordinary losses to the\nextent of previously recognized gains. The\nelection must be made separately for each PFIC\nowned by the Fund and, once made, would be\neffective for all subsequent taxable years,\nunless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By\nmaking the election, the Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. The Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. The Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to the Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible\n\n65\n\ndividends as such qualified net interest\nincome or as qualified short-term capital\ngains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or\nin part, as ineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund\u2019s assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund\u2019s shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder\u2019s gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund\u2019s shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. A foreign\nshareholder also may be subject to certain \u201c\nwash sale \u201d rules to prevent the avoidance of\nthe tax filing and payment obligations\ndiscussed above through the sale and\nrepurchase of Fund shares. Shareholders that\nare nonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of the Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n\n66\n\nFinancial Statements Financial statements for\nthe Fund are not available because, as of the\ndate of this SAI, the Fund has no financial\ninformation to report.

Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements. BlackRock has adopted guidelines\nand procedures (together and as from time to\ntime amended, the \u201c BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\naccounts managed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\ncast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on\nspecific proxy issues in respect of securities\nheld by each such Fund (or may refrain from\nvoting) in accordance with the BlackRock proxy\nvoting guidelines. BlackRock will report on an\nannual basis to the Directors on (1) a summary\nof the proxy voting process as applicable to\nthe Funds in the preceding year together with\na representation that all votes were in\naccordance with the BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines, and (2) any changes to the\nBlackRock proxy voting guidelines that have\nnot previously been reported.\n\nA-1\n\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship Global\nPrinciples Effective as of January 2024\nBlackRock\n\nA-2\n                                              \n  Contents                                    \n  Introduction to BlackRock             A-4   \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship  A-4   \n  Shareholder rights                    A-4   \n  Key themes                            A-4   \n  Boards and directors                  A-5   \n  Auditors and audit-related issues     A-7   \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other                      A-8   \n  special transactions                        \n  Executive compensation                A-8   \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                             A-9   \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                       A-11  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                 A-11  \n  BlackRock\u2019s oversight of its                \n  investment                            A-12  \n  stewardship activities                      \n  Vote execution                        A-12  \n  Voting Choice                         A-13  \n  Conflicts management policies and     A-13  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                    A-14  \n  Voting guidelines                     A-14  \n  Reporting and vote transparency       A-15  \n                                              \nThe purpose of this document is to provide an\noverarching explanation of BlackRock\u2019s\napproach globally to our responsibilities as a\nshareholder on behalf of our clients, our\nexpectations of companies, and our commitments\nto clients in terms of our own governance and\ntransparency.\n\nA-3\n\nIntroduction to BlackRock BlackRock\u2019s purpose\nis to help more and more people experience\nfinancial well-being. We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-TOPT-1024\n                iShares Trust                 \n                                              \n      File Nos. 333-92935 and 811-09729       \n                                              \n                    Part C                    \n                                              \n              Other Information               \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item\u200928.
